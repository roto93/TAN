                              Workshop on 

                THE STATISTICS OF COSMOLOGICAL DATA SETS

     Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences, Cambridge, UK

                            8 - 13 August 1999

In the past decade cosmology has undergone a renaissance, graduating from 
a data-starved science to a data-driven one. Observations of the Cosmic 
Microwave Background by balloons and the COBE satellite have begun to give 
us a detailed picture of the universe during its early history ; the Hubble 
Space Telescope and the Keck Telescope have found galaxies at distances 
corresponding to the universe at one-tenth of its present age; the CFA and 
APM large-scale redshift surveys have begun to map out the present 
structure of the nearby universe. Thanks to the large investments that 
science agencies are making in cosmology, the amount of data coming from 
all these fronts will increase by orders of magnitude in the coming decade.

The number and size of these data sets have led researchers to rethink 
analysis strategies. Existing algorithms and hardware are overwhelmed by 
the sheer volume of the new data. Fortunately, it has become possible to 
apply a plethora of new statistical techniques. The aim of this workshop is 
to discuss this transition. A series of experts will describe developments 
in various fields, emphazising the technical aspects of their work and the 
places where particular statistical problems appear. Stress will be placed 
upon the special statistical challenges created by handling large 
astronomical data sets and the problems of pattern recognition, directional 
statistics, and geometrical statistics that arise in the description of 
three-dimensional clustering. There will be opportunity for statisticians 
to provide input into the solution of these problems and to form fruitful 
collaborations with astronomers. The list of topics to be discussed 
includes

       - Analysis of large cosmological data sets 
       - Parameter estimation from combined data sets 
       - Analysis issues specific to CMB, peculiar velocity, microlensing, 
         red shift and weak lensing data sets 
       - Wavelet techniques 
       - Spectral and non-Gaussian estimation 
       - Pattern recognition 
       - Measures of clustering 
       - Shape and topological statistics, Minkowski functionals

Organisers: A Albrecht (UC Davis), J Barrow (U Sussex), PG Ferreira (CERN 
& IST, Lisbon), J Silk (Oxford)

Preliminary list of speakers: L Da Costa, M Davis*, A Dekel, C Dodson, 
R Ellis, K Greist, K Gorski, A Jaffe, M Joyce*, R Juzskiewicz, S Hanany*, 
Y Hoffman, O Lahav, T Lewis, J Magueijo, F Murtagh, B Ripley*, 
F Sylos-Labini, D Spergel, A Szalay (* to be confirmed)

Location and Costs:  The workshop will take place at the Newton Institute 
and accommodation for participants will be provided at Wolfson Court, 
adjacent to the Institute.  The conference package costs UKP300 which 
includes registration fees, accommodation, breakfast and evening meals plus 
lunch and refreshments during the days that the workshop takes place.
