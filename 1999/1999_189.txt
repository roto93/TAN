     The power was just re-installed a few moments ago at our institute. 
It has been 26 hours since the terrible earthquake which shoke the entire 
island of Taiwan. The damages in our institute are minimum. The worst
scene is in the library. Books and bonded magazines are all over the
floor. There was also chemical fluid near the entrance, apparently leaked 
from the lab above during the quake. Receiver Lab has no damage. The
emergency power in our building has kept the machines running.
     This was so far the biggest I have ever experienced. The first strong
shake lasted at least 2-3 minutes. The after quakes some of which were
quite impressive by ordinary scale were kept going almost 30-45 minutes. 
I did not run out of the building I live. Somehow when I was about to take
some action, the quakes begin to taper off. By now you must
hear or read: It was 7.3 on Ritcher scale. The epicenter is near "Sun
Moon Lake" (close to Taichung). So far there are 700 deaths and 2500
injuries. The numbers are still climbing. (As I write here, another
after quake just hit here). Also, there are at least 1200 people known 
trapped in the collapsed buildings.
     I'll keep you guys posted when other stories develop. As for now,
do worry. We are doing fine.
     Fred, I called Helen and Derek. They are both doing well. Of course,
Derek enjoys an extra holiday at home.
     With best regards,                        Chi
