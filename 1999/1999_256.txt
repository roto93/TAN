Applications are invited for a Research Associate position at JPL.
The Associate will participate in the analysis and interpretation

Candidates should specialize in radio astronomy and preferably  
have prior experience with VLBI data analysis.  Strong written 
and verbal communication skills are important.  Candidates should  
have a PhD in astronomy by the starting date.  Research Associates 
will have access to good research facilities including considerable  
computing resources and possible use of radio and optical telscopes 
at Caltech astronomical observatories.  The appointment is normally 
for two years, with a possibility of renewal for a third year.   
The stipend is approximately $42K per year. 

To apply, please contact both Drs. Preston and Jones by email to 
discuss possible research proposals as soon as possible.  The National

an Associateship, and the next deadline for submission is 15 January 
2000.  Supporting documents, including graduate and undergraduate  
transcripts and four reference reports, must be received by 15 February.
