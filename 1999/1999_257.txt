3.  AAS OFF-LINE 31 DEC 1999 - 3 JANUARY 2000

The AAS has decided to err on the side of caution during 
the New Year celebration.  We will be doing a complete backup 
of our systems and storing the tapes off-site.  In addition, 
we will be bringing down all of our Internet services during 
the period of Friday, 31 Dec 1999, 5:00pm EDT until Monday, 
3 January 2000, 9:00am.

We have decided to take this conservative approach to the 
unknown factors that might affect our system or the internet 
during the change from 1999 to 2000.  It also gives us the 
opportunity to fully test our systems before deploying them 
again on January 3rd.

This ultimately means that email sent to the aas.org domain 
will either bounce back or be held in your email server's queue 
until we are back online.  It also means that our web services 
will be unavailable to any browsers.

We hope this does not inconvenience you.  The AAS Staff would 
like to extend our wishes for a Happy and Healthy New Year to 
you and yours.

4.  FINAL INVOICE NOTICE FOR MEMBERSHIP YEAR 2000

The final invoice notices, to those who have not renewed, 
will be mailed this week.  Members who have not renewed 
their membership should do so by 31 January 2000.

5.  CANNON PRIZE LIST - DIRECTORY CORRECTION

We note the following errata in the 2000 Membership Directory 
on page 13:

The prize winners dated 1990-1999 at the bottom of the list 
of Beatrice M. Tinsley Prize winners are actually winners of 
Annie Jump Cannon Award, and their names belong at the end of 
the preceding column.

6.  FCRAO OBSERVING PROPOSALS

The Five College Radio Astronomy Observatory invites proposals 
for observations using the 14 meter telescope in the period 
February 2000 to May 2000.  The proposal deadline is 
15 January 2000.  The Observatory is equipped with a 16 element 
focal plane array receiver which operates between 85 and 
115 GHz and a set  of autocorrelation spectrometers and filter 
banks for molecular spectroscopy.  

Instructions for the submission of proposals and technical 
information can be found at http://www.astro.umass.edu/~fcrao

7.  AEOS TELESCOPE TIME AVAILABLE AT AIR FORCE MAUI OBSERVATORY
    James Breckinridge, jbreckin@nsf.gov

The U S Air Force and the National Science Foundation have 
entered into an agreement to jointly manage the use of the 
3.67 meter Advanced Electro-Optical System (AEOS) telescope 
at The Air Force Maui Observatory for the development of 
astronomical instruments and for astronomy. 

Proposal deadline is mid-February 2000. A workshop will be 
held on Thursday 13 January at the AAS meeting in Atlanta in 
Hanover E  from 7:00 to 9:00 PM to discuss technical capabilities 
of the telescope and the process for applying for telescope and 
instrument development time.  Representatives of the NSF
and the U S Air Force will be present to answer questions.
