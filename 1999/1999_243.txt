FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
November 19, 1999


                          WOLFF RESIGNS AS NOAO DIRECTOR

 
The AURA Board of Directors has released the following statement:

Dr. Sidney Wolff has informed the Board of Directors of AURA that she wishes to resign  as Director of the National Optical Astronomy Observatories (NOAO).  The Board has accepted her resignation effective December 31, 1999, with the understanding that she will continue to serve until a successor is in place.  Further, the Board has charged the AURA Observatories Council with promptly establishing a search committee for a new NOAO Director.  The Observatories Council is a committee of the Board with responsibility for independent management oversight and advocacy for NOAO.

Dr. Wolff has served with distinction as Director of NOAO since 1987.  During this time the role of the National Observatories has changed in major ways.  Dr. Wolff is responsible for the structuring of partnerships to develop major new facilities such as WIYN and SOAR that will increase public access to state of the art telescopes.  Dr. Wolff led the community-based effort to develop the scientific, technical, and management proposal for the Gemini telescopes, served as the first director of the Gemini project, and was responsible for its early success.  The GONG network to study solar helioseismology was deployed during her  tenure, and construction began on the SOLIS facility, which will monitor solar activity.  Recently, Dr. Wolff led in the development of a long-range plan for NOAO that includes 
major new survey capabilities and the possibility of a 50- to 100-meter large aperture telescope.   She has also pioneered efforts to develop collaborative scientific programs with Chandra and SIRTF that will leverage ground- and space-based astronomical capabilities.

Today, the major ongoing projects (GNIRS and SOLIS) are both making excellent progress, the reallocation of resources needed for NOAO's new role of supporting the US users of the Gemini telescopes is nearly complete, and a vision has been articulated that will carry NOAO through the next decade.  Dr. Wolff's personal commitment to science and to the role of the National Observatories will provide a strong legacy on which to build.  

The AURA Board thanks Dr. Wolff her many years of dedicated leadership, and contributions to astronomy.  In addition, the Board is grateful for her willingness to continue to serve during this transition period and bring the many initiatives she has started to fruition.

The Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc. (AURA) operates the National Optical Astronomy Observatories under cooperative agreement with the National Science Foundation.  NOAO operates Kitt Peak National Observatory (Arizona), Cerro Tololo Inter-American 
Observatory (Chile), the National Solar Observatory (Arizona & New Mexico), and the US Gemini Project Office.  AURA is a non-profit consortium of 29 US institutions and five international affiliates.
