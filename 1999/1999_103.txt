Session 1:  Colloquium (2:00 - 3:00 pm)
 
            SPEAKER: Prof. Pat Henry
                     (University of Hawaii)
            TITLE:   "Measuring Cosmological Parameters from the Evolution 
                      of Cluster X-ray Temperatures
            ABSTRACT:
We have determined the cluster X-ray temperature function from two flux-
limited samples of clusters. The first sample is comprised of 25 clusters with
average redshift 0.05. The second is comprised of 14 clusters with average 
redshift 0.38. We perform maximum likelihood fits of cluster evolution 
models to these data in order to constrain cosmological parameters. For an 
open model with zero cosmological constant we find that the density 
parameter is Omega_0 = 0.52 +/- 0.11, the rms mass density fluctuation 
averaged over 8 h-1 Mpc spheres is sigma_8 = 0.71 +/- 0.09, and the effective 
index of the mass density fluctuation spectrum on cluster scales is n = 
-(1.7 +/- 0.3) where all errors are symmetrized at 68% confidence. The 
corresponding results for the case where a cosmological constant produces a 
flat universe are: 0.45 +/- 0.11, 0.77 +/- 0.15, and -(1.7 +/- 0.3). These 
results agree with a those determined from a variety of different independent 
methods, including supernovae, galaxy-galaxy correlations, fluctuations in 
the microwave background, and cluster peculiar velocities.

 
Session 2:  Colloquium (3:15 - 4:15 pm)
 
            SPEAKER: Dr. Hsien Shang
                     (University of California, Berkeley)
            TITLE:   "Probing the Jet Phenomena in Young Stellar Objects"
