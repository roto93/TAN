Session 1:  Colloquium (2:30 - 3:30 pm)

            SPEAKER: Pre-Dr Hsiao-Wen Chen
                     (State University of New York)
	    TITLE:   "The gaseous extent of galaxies and 
	              the origin of Lyman-Alpha absorption line systems "

            ABSTRACT: The absorption line systems observed in the spectra of 
background QSOs have provided a unique probe to the distant universe and
the extended gas surrounding intervening galaxies. Comparison of galaxy
and absorber redshifts along common lines of sight shows that there exists
a distinct anti-correlation between Lyman-alpha absorption equivalent width and
galaxy impact parameter at z<1. Detailed studies on the absorbing galaxies
show that (1) luminous galaxies are surrounded by extended gaseous 
envelopes of approximately 200 kpc radius, (2) extended gaseous envelopes
are a common and generic feature of galaxies of a wide range of luminosity
and morphological type, and (3) Lyman-alpha absorption systems trace a
significant and representative portion of the galaxy population. The most
important implication of the results is that it provides for the first
time a means of quantitatively relating statistical properties of Lyman-alpha
absorption systems to statistical properties of faint galaxies. If these
results apply to galaxies at all redshifts, it is found that known 
galaxies of known gaseous extent must produce a significant fraction of
Lyman-alpha absorption systems at all redshifts.


Session 2:  Colloquium (3:45 -- 4:45)

            SPEAKER: Pre-Dr. Jiun-Huei Proty Wu 
                     (University of Cambridge)
	    TITLE:   "Theoretical Modelling of Structure Formation"
	    
	    ABSTRACT: 
One of the outstanding problems in cosmology today is developing a more
precise understanding of structure formation in the universe, that is, the
origin of galaxies and other large-scale structures. Existing theories for
the structure formation of the universe fall into two categories, based
either upon the amplification of quantum fluctuations in a scalar field
during inflation, or upon a symmetry breaking phase transition in the early
universe which leads to the formation of topological defects.

This talk will review the historical and the theoretical backgrounds of both
inflationary and cosmic defect models. The current status of both theories
will be presented, including the observational tests via large-scale
structure (LSS), cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) and Gaussian
test. The role of the cosmological constant in this issue will be also
discussed. Some future prospectuses regarding both theoretical development
and observational tests (e.g. Planck, MAP) will be summarized.
