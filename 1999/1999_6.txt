1. DARK SKIES FACE POTENTIAL THREAT IN SOUTHERN ARIZONA

In recent editorials in Southern Arizona papers (Tucson Citizen 
1/6/99 and Arizona Daily Star 1/8/99) and an insightful article 
in the Arizona star (12/22/98), a threat to the dark skies 
near Mount Hopkins has come to light.  A local developer is 
hoping to change the zoning of a relatively large parcel of 
land.  This rezoning would allow enough light-emitting 
structures to be built that the observatory facilities on 
nearby Mount Hopkins would be affected.  

Members are encouraged to find out the details at the Tucson 
Citizen's Southern Arizona Website
(http://www.tucsoncitizen.com/news/stories/story1072637.html) 
and another site detailing the situation 
(http://www.treefort.org/~sykes).  The Pima County Board of 
Supervisors was scheduled to vote on the matter on 12 January 1999, 
so quick action is suggested.  For further information, contact 
Kevin Marvel (marvel@aas.org), the AAS Associate Executive Officer 
for Policy Programs.

2. NATIONAL ACADEMY SPECIAL ASTRONOMY PROCEEDINGS 

The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences will be 
running three special issues on Astronomy on 13 April, 27 April 
and 11 May 1999. These issues will be made available at the 
American Astronomical Society's 194th Meeting in Chicago, IL, 
on 30 May - 3 June 1999. Submission of research papers to be 
considered for publication in these issues, or enquires about
submission, should be sent, as soon as possible and preferably 
on or before 1 March, to Guy Riddihough, 1055 Thomas Jefferson 
St NW, Suite 2013, Washington DC  20007 (tel: 202 334 1370; 
fax 202 334 2738; griddiho@nas.edu). All submissions will be 
handled quickly.

3. NSF LIFE IN EXTREME ENVIRONMENTS PROGRAM
   Proposal Deadline: 5 March 1999 

The National Science Foundation announces the FY99 Special 
Competition for Life in Extreme Environments (LExEn) Program.  
Two research areas of the LExEn program may be of special
interest to the astronomical community.

1)The LExEn Interdisciplinary Research Program
Topics in this focus area include:
** formation of Earth, other planets and their satellites
** remote sensing of planets and their atmospheres
** studies of interstellar grains and meteorites to establish 
   criteria for the presence of biogenic substances
** studies of interstellar and cometary chemistry, 
   particularly of biologically relevant molecules
** the relationship between interstellar organic molecules 
   and the origin of life

2)Methods and Capabilities for LExEn Research
Includes support of projects to develop or apply new methods 
or technologies, including : 
** sensors and sensing techniques to probe extreme 
   environments on Earth or other planets
** methods to investigate the potential for habitable 
   environments on other planets (including theory and modeling)

For more information consult the program announcement 
at http://www.nsf.gov/home/crssprgm/lexen
or contact Dr. Eileen Friel, efriel@nsf.gov, (703) 306-1826.

4.  CELEBRATING THE ASTRONOMICAL ALMANAC
    By Heidi B. Hammel

A small symposium is being organized to celebrate the 
150th anniversary of the Nautical Almanac Office in 
March 1999.  I've been asked to make a brief presentation 
about "How I Use the Astronomical Almanac for Astronomy" 
(other uses will include the air force, civilian navigators, 
navigation, and timing), and I'll also be drafting a paper 
in conjunction with the presentation.  I'd like to be able 
to broaden the presentation and paper beyond simply my own 
experiences.  If you have interesting anecdotes to share 
about using the AA, or would like to make sure your favorite 
astronomical use is represented, please drop me a note at 
hbh@alum.mit.edu, or call me at 203-438-3506.  Contact me 
before 1 February 1999, please, and thanks for any input!

5. 2MASS SAMPLER DATA RELEASE

The Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) announces the public 
availability of the 2MASS Sampler Data Release.  The Sampler 
data products can be accessed from the IPAC/2MASS Web site at 
http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/2mass/ or directly from the 
NASA/Infrared Science Archive site at 
http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/.

The objective of the 2MASS Sampler is to introduce the 
astronomical community to the content and format of the 
2MASS datasets, and to the web-based Access Tools, to 
provide an opportunity for the 2MASS project to receive 
community feedback in preparation for a large 1999 Spring 
data release, and to enable the community to carry out 
scientific investigations with the 2MASS dataset for the 
first time. 

The 2MASS Sampler consists of a Point Source Catalog 
containing 227,197 objects, an Extended Source Catalog
containing 2,133 resolved sources, and 5,658 compressed
512x1024 pixel (1"/pixel) images, covering about 63 square 
degrees of the northern sky.
  
The 2MASS webpage contains general information and documentation
about this data release.  Assistance with the Sampler is 
available via the 2MASS Help Desk at 2mass@ipac.caltech.edu.
 
A CD-ROM containing the Sampler data is also available.

The Two Micron All Sky Survey is a joint project of
the University of Massachusetts and the Infrared Processing 
and Analysis Center, funded by the NASA and the NSF.
