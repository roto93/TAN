Dear Friends, 

We are advertising a post-doctoral position at NOAO/Tucson 
to work with the NOAO Deep Wide Field Survey data. We would 
appreciate it if you could pass this ad along to any 
qualified and interested candidates and post this notice in 
your institution. 

Thank you. 

Best regards, 

Buell Jannuzi & Arjun Dey

POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCH ASSOCIATE NDWFS, NOAO 

The NOAO Deep Wide-Field Survey project invites applications for a
postdoctoral position to work with the NOAO Survey team in analyzing
the optical and near-infrared imaging data. The NOAO Deep Wide-Field
Survey (NDWFS) is a project to map two 9 square degree patches of sky
in order to study the evolution and large scale structure of high
redshift galaxy populations. The imaging data will be used to carry out
a wide range of studies from searches for low-mass stars to studies of
distant galaxies, and hence applications from candidates with a wide
range of interests are encouraged. The successful applicant will be
expected to lead and carry out independent research projects based on
the survey data in fields of their choosing. The initial appointment
will be for 2 years with the possibility of an extension for an
additional year contingent upon funding. The survey co- PI's (Buell
Jannuzi and Arjun Dey) are collaborating with members of the SIRTF IRS
GTO team in a planned MIPS imaging survey and IRS follow-up of one of
the two NDWFS survey fields and we anticipate that there will be
opportunities for the NDWFS post-doc to be involved in that work as well.

Applicants should submit a letter outlining their qualifications and
reason for interest in the NOAO Deep Wide-Field Survey, a statement of
their research interests, CV, bibliography, and at least two letters of
recommendation. Interested applicants are encouraged to contact Drs.
Buell Jannuzi (bjannuzi@noao.edu) and Arjun Dey (adey@noao.edu) for
more information. Applications should be submitted by February 25, 2000.
