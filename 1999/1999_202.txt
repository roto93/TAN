1.  NEWSLETTER CORRECTION

The name of Bruce Partridge, Education Officer  was 
inadvertently omitted from the list of election candidates 
published in the October Newsletter.  We apologize for the 
mistake.

2.  ATLANTA MEETING DEADLINE REMINDER
    11 - 15 January 2000 -- Atlanta, GA
    http://www.aas.org

Abstract Deadline:      Tuesday, 26 October 1999, 9pm ET 
Registration Deadline:  Wednesday, 8 December 1999
Housing Requests:       Wednesday, 8 December 1999

The Atlanta Final Program will be mailed to all who register 
by 8 December 1999.

3.  ROCHESTER TOPICAL SESSION PROPOSALS DUE
    Proposals Due:  15 November 1999

Two days of the four-day Rochester Meeting are available
for Topical Sessions.  Members interested in organizing 
Sessions are invited to submit proposals.  This is a great
opportunity to highlight your area of astronomy for the
rest of the meeting attendees.

Further information is available at:
        
        http://www.aas.org/meetings/topguide.html

4.  STRATEGIC PLAN FOR NSF'S DIVISION OF ASTRONOMICAL SCIENCES
 
The new Strategic Plan for the Division of Astronomical 
Sciences (AST), in the Directorate for Mathematical and 
Physical Sciences (MPS) at the National Science Foundation 
(NSF), is now publicly available on AST's Web page,

http://www.nsf.gov/mps/ast/strategicplan/index.htm

The Division has asked the Committee on Astronomy and 
Astrophysics (CAA) to provide advice on reconciling this 
Strategic Plan with the report of the Astronomy and 
Astrophysics Survey Committee (AASC) when the latter
document becomes available.

5.  NSF MAJOR RESEARCH INSTRUMENTATION COMPETITION
    Joe Burt, OIA

The solicitation for the 2000 Major Research Instrumentation 
(MRI) competition is now publicly available on the NSF website
http://www.nsf.gov.  The publication number is 99-168.  
You can see the solicitation in the NSF online document 
system or on the OIA homepage.

The deadline for submission of proposals is 18 January 2000.  
Please note that this deadline is about one month earlier 
than last year.

All MRI proposals must be submitted via FastLane.  This 
year we are requiring the signed cover sheet and all 
accompanying documents (letter of cost sharing commitment,
letters of support, manufacturers' quotes, etc.) electronically 
by scanning these documents into the Supplementary Documents 
section of the FastLane proposal preparation module and 
submitting them along with the proposal.  This is a major 
change in timing since proposers will have to submit
the signed cover sheet electronically with the proposal 
rather than five business days later in hard copy.

If you have any questions about the solicitation, please 
contact the Office of Integrative Activities at 703-306-1040 
or mri@nsf.gov.

6.  REAL-TIME LEONID METEOR STORM TRACKING

The Aerospace Corporation's Space Operations Support Office 
(SOPSO) is planning to collect  data on the 1999 Leonid Meteor 
storm and disseminate it in real time on the World Wide Web.  
Users can monitor the storm's activity  by visiting 
http://WWW.LEONIDSTORM.COM.  Data from various well-qualified 
observes will be displayed in graphical form (ZHR, raw counts, 
etc.) along with the time of the predicted peak.  Real time 
summaries of the storm's progress, and anecdotal reports of 
unusual events such as fireballs, etc. will also be provided.  

At the present time we have commitments from a number of 
observations teams including both ground and aircraft-based 
campaigns.  Data need not be submitted as ZHR.  Data in any 
uniform manner which will indicate relative strength of the 
storm are acceptable.  If you would be interested in contributing 
your data real time, please contact Dr. David K. Lynch or 
Dr. William H. Ailor at The Aerospace Corporation 
(david.k.lynch@aero.org, william.h.ailor@aero.org). If you
will be displaying your own real time data and do not wish to
contribute to our efforts, we will be happy to include a link to 
your site.

7.  WIRE STAR CAMERA CONTINUATION POSSIBLE
    Comment by end of October 1999

Dear Colleagues:

As many of you are aware, the WIRE satellite, whose primary 
scientific mission has not succeeded, has nevertheless been 
used to perform time resolved stellar photometry and, in 
particular, stellar seismology using the 5 cm star-tracker 
telescope and its associated CCD camera. 

The WIRE star-tracker presents a unique opportunity to the 
astronomy community to utilize the CCD camera from a stabilized 
platform in space.  At present, there are no plans to continue 
WIRE astronomical observations past the beginning of the next 
calendar year.  

However, if there is sufficient interest in the community to 
make use of the WIRE satellite star-tracker for continued 
astronomical observations, NASA Headquarters is prepared to 
provide an opportunity through the ADP program.

Please read the attached short description of the capabilities 
of the WIRE star-tracker. Most importantly, if you think that 
you would be interested in observations with this instrument, 
please send me a brief note before the end of October indicating 
what you have in mind.

Not only does this letter not commit NASA to implement an 
observing program with WIRE, nor would your note commit you 
to participate in such a program. 

Sincerely yours, 


Philippe Crane

WIRE Star Camera Technical Information

The WIRE star camera is a Ball Aerospace and Technologies 
Corporation model CT-601. It consists of a 52 mm aperture 
feeding light to a 5122 SiTe CCD. The field of view is 8 x 8 
degrees, with a pixel size of 1 arc minute. The gain is 
approximately 15 electrons/ADU, and the bandpass (which is 
unfiltered) is roughly V+R. Data is digitized using a 16-bit 
ADC.  The limiting magnitude of the star camera is 
approximately 6, and pointing is severely degraded beyond 
this limit.

The star camera can be operated in one of two modes. First,
single-target mode, where an 8 x 8 pixel box is returned to 
the ground surrounding a single target. In single-target mode, 
the observing cadence is 10 Hz. This mode is essentially 
absolute photometry, and as such is dependent on the pointing
characteristics of the satellite (since the CCD FOV is
asymmetrically vignetted) and the drift characteristics of 
the star camera itself. When observing bright stars (m < 2), 
we have observed little drift: the rms pointing precision of 
WIRE typically is better than one arc second. Non-Poisson noise 
in the data appears to be primarily due to thermal drifts in 
the detector, which for brighter targets (2nd magnitude) 
contributes a signal less than the Poisson noise. Temperature 
information is available from a thermistor mounted on the rear 
of the CCD assembly, should observers wish to attempt correcting 
for thermal drifts. The second operating mode is multi-target, 
where up to five targets can be observed simultaneously, though 
the observing cadence drops to 1 Hz. In this mode, an 8 x 8 
pixel box around each star is returned, and relatively crude 
ensemble photometry can be performed.

For observations of a mv = 0 solar-like star, we obtain an 
integrated count rate of approximately 1.2 x 10**6 
electrons/sec. The PSF of the instrument is such that 
essentially all of the stellar flux is contained in the 
central 4 pixels of the 64-pixel box, and an annulus around 
the outer portion of the box can be used for background 
subtraction. For such a star, the rms noise from all sources 
in the extracted aperture photometry is approximately 1.3 - 
1.5 millimagnitudes.
