Abstract:
The first measurement of the photospheric abundances in a star at the
Galactic Center are presented.  A detailed abundance analysis of the
Galactic Center M2 supergiant IRS 7 was carried out using
high-resolution near-infrared echelle spectra.  The Fe abundance for
IRS 7 was found to be close to solar, [Fe/H] = -0.02 +/- 0.13, and
nearly identical to the Fe abundances we obtained for the nearby M
supergiants alpha Ori and VV Cep.  Analysis of the first and second
overtone lines of CO was used to derive an effective temperature of
3600 +/- 230 K, a microturbulent velocity of 3.0 +/- 0.3 km s^-1, and
a carbon abundance log \epsilon(C) = 7.78 +/- 0.13, or [C/H] = -0.77.
In addition, we find a high depletion of 0.74 +/- 0.32 dex in O and an
enhancement of 0.92 +/- 0.18 dex in N.  These abundances are
consistent with the dredge-up of CNO-cycle products but require deep
mixing in excess of that predicted by standard models for red
supergiants.  In light of our measured solar Fe abundance for IRS 7,
we discuss other indicators of metallicity at the Galactic Center, the
interpretation of low-resolution near-infrared spectra of late-type
giants and supergiants, including the need for caution in using such
spectra as measures of metallicity, and the evolution of massive young
stars at the Galactic Center.  We suggest the possibility that rapid
stellar rotation is common for stars formed under conditions in the
Galactic Center, and that extra internal mixing induced by high
rotation rates, rather than evolution at high metallicity, is the
explanation for many of the unusual properties of the hot
emission-line stars in the Galactic Center.
