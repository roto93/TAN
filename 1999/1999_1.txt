Session 1:  Colloquium (2:30 - 3:30 pm)

            SPEAKER: Pre-Dr Hsiao-Wen Chen
                     (State University of New York)
	    TITLE:   "The gaseous extent of galaxies and 
	              the origin of Lyman-Alpha absorption line systems "

            ABSTRACT: The absorption line systems observed in the spectra of 
background QSOs have provided a unique probe to the distant universe and
the extended gas surrounding intervening galaxies. Comparison of galaxy
and absorber redshifts along common lines of sight shows that there exists
a distinct anti-correlation between Lyman-alpha absorption equivalent width and
galaxy impact parameter at z<1. Detailed studies on the absorbing galaxies
show that (1) luminous galaxies are surrounded by extended gaseous 
envelopes of approximately 200 kpc radius, (2) extended gaseous envelopes
are a common and generic feature of galaxies of a wide range of luminosity
and morphological type, and (3) Lyman-alpha absorption systems trace a
significant and representative portion of the galaxy population. The most
important implication of the results is that it provides for the first
time a means of quantitatively relating statistical properties of Lyman-alpha
absorption systems to statistical properties of faint galaxies. If these
results apply to galaxies at all redshifts, it is found that known 
galaxies of known gaseous extent must produce a significant fraction of
Lyman-alpha absorption systems at all redshifts.


Session 2:  Colloquium (3:45 -- 4:45)

                     (University of Cambridge)
	    TITLE:   "Theoretical Modelling of Structure Formation"
