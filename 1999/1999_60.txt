Session 1:  Colloquium (2:00 - 3:00 pm)

            SPEAKER: Pre-Dr. Ing-Guey Jiang 
                     (Oxford University)
	    TITLE:   "Galactic Warps II: the Effect of Mass Accretion"
	    ABSTRACT:
This is an extension of the talk I gave in the ASIAA-NCU Joint Seminar of 
Dec. 1997. In order to make those who were not there to follow it happily,
I will review the points at the beginning of my talk.

The second part of this talk will be the effect of mass accretion, for
instance, the cosmic infall: N-body simulations show that when infall 
reorientates the outer parts of a galactic halo by several degrees per Gyr, 
a self-gravitating disk that is embedded in the halo develops an 
integral-sign warp that is comparable in amplitude to observed warps. 
Studies of angular-momentum acquisition suggest that the required rate 
of halo reorientation is realistic for galaxies like the Milky Way.

I will finish this talk by mentioning our recent attempts to model the Milky 
Way warp and the observational support from the letter entitled 
`` Ring Structure and Warp of NGC 5907 - Interaction with Dwarf Galaxies '' 
by Zhaohui Shang,..,Elias Brinks,..,Wei-Hsin Sun and the other members of 
Beijing-Arizona-Taipei-Connecticut Color Survey in ApJ 504, L23.




Session 2:  Colloquium (3:15 -- 4:15 pm)

            SPEAKER: Pre-Dr. Kate Y. L. Su 
                     (University of Calgary)
	    TITLE:   "Proto-Planetary Nebulae: 
	              HST Observation and Numerical Modeling
	    ABSTRACT:
High resolution V band images of four proto-planetary nebulae (PPN), 
which have been resolved as non-spherical shapes in the ground-base 
observation, taken using Wide-Field Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) on the 
Hubble Space Telescope (HST), are reported. The WFPC2/HST images reveal 
a variety of structures not seen in the previous ground-base observation. 
In particular, a series of concentric arcs superimposed on the two 
reflection nebular lobes and two "searchlight beams" emanating from the 
obscured central star are detected in IRAS 17150-3224, which are similar 
to those in the Egg Nebula. The existence of arcs suggests that periodic 
mass loss enhancement is a common phenomenon in the AGB phase. In addition, 
the near circular shape of the arcs also indicates that mass loss is 
spherically symmetric during the AGB phase and the bipolar morphology 
develops only after the end of the AGB phase. Two of the PPN, 
IRAS 17245-3951 and IRAS 17441-2411, show clearly bipolar morphology 
separated by a well-defined dark lane. Two faint arcs are also detected 
in IRAS 17441-2411. 
 
In order to interpret the asymmetry in PPN, a non-spherical dust shell 
model is also presented. Assuming non-spherical density and temperature 
distributions around the obscured central star and the viewing angle of 
the object, a numerically simulated spectral energy distribution (SED) 
and sky brightness maps in different wavelengths can be calculated. 
Constrained by the observed SED and flux ratio between the two lobes of 
the nebula, we can simulate the asymmetrical dust shell for each object. 
I will also report and discuss the numerical simulation results in my talk.
