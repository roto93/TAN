**********************************************************************
195th Meeting of the American Astronomical Society
11-15 January 2000
Atlanta, Georgia


The Atlanta Preliminary Announcement is available online at:

    http://www.aas.org/meetings/aas195/prelim/prelim.html

The abstract deadline is 9:00pm ET, Tuesday, 26 October 1999.
The deadline for early registration is 8 December 1999.  Abstract,
registration, and hotel forms and complete instructions are posted.

The Meeting Announcement with paper meeting and hotel registration 
forms has been mailed to all members.  

Note Change in Meeting Program Mailing:  Due to a steady increase 
in production and mailing costs, we are going to discontinue mailing 
the Final Program to all members of the Society.  We will continue 
to print the Program.  It will be mailed to all who register by the 
early registration deadline, 8 December 1999, and will be distributed 
at the meeting.

All Program information is available on the website, well in advance 
of when the Program book is printed.  Members who can obtain this 
information from the web are requested to do so.  Any member who is 
unable to access the web information may obtain a copy by special 
request to the Executive Office (reg-help@aas.org).
