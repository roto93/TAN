                  MERLIN/VLBI National Facility Newsletter

                         Number 1:  September, 1999


This is the first of a regular biannual newsletter that will describe 
activities at the MERLIN/VLBI National Facility (NF). In the past there 
has been no clear mechanism for disseminating information to the NF's 
user community; this is being rectified through this newsletter and also 
through the publication of a more detailed biennial report. Copies of the 
first edition of this report, covering the period 1997-1998, were made 
available at NAM and will be distributed further within the next two weeks.

The newsletter is also available on the web at:

             http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/merlin/newsletter

Call for Proposals
------------------

There are two proposal deadlines approaching that are relevant to the NF.
The first is the deadline for Semester 00A on MERLIN. Note that the 
MERLIN deadline is non-standard and after the busy time of October 1, 
this is possible because the NF staff process the proposals for the PPARC
secretariat.

    The proposal deadline is '9th October 1999'. All details are in the
    MERLIN web area, specifically:
         http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/merlin/schedules/index.html
    MERLIN will be offering 22GHz, 5GHz, and 1.4-1.7GHz for Semester 00A
    (although it is not yet clear if the Lovell telescope will be 
    available for 1.4-1.7 GHz in 00A). 
    Proposal forms, information on MERLIN Key Programmes, and further
    general information can be obtained via:    
         www:    http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/merlin/MERLIN.html
         ftp:    ftp.jb.man.ac.uk, Directory: /pub/merlin/semester_00A
         email:  merlin@jb.man.ac.uk

The second is the autumn deadline for European and global VLBI:

    The proposal deadline is '1st October 1999'. All details may be
    found in the EVN USERS GUIDE at:
         http://www.nfra.nl/jive/evn/evn.html
    The provisional plan for EVN observing sessions in 2000 is given 
    below, proposals received by October 1st will be considered for 
    scheduling in any of the sessions listed.

   2000   Session 1  Feb 10 - Mar 02   6 cm (+MERLIN),  18/21 cm,  + ??    
   2000   Session 2  May 25 - Jun 15   6 cm,            18/21 cm,  + ??     
   2000   Session 3  Sep 06 - Sep 27   6 cm,            18/21 cm,  + ??
   2000   Session 4  Nov 08 - Nov 25   6 cm,            18/21 cm,  + ??

    The ?? signify wavelengths to be allocated based on proposal pressure.

General News
------------

At the time of writing PPARC have not yet notified us of our final budget 
for the next grant period. As some of you may be aware there is worry on
that front since the rate of salary increases is greater than the inflation 
indexation rate applied to all PPARC grants. This, combined with the lack of 
inflationary increases for the NF grant in the past means that the operational, 
non-staff costs for the NF are under severe pressure. At the June meeting of 
the Ground Based Facilities Committee (GBFC) the NF's problems were recognized 
and a short-term financial band-aid was promised which may help the situation. 
However, in the longer term other measures are needed and GBFC decided that 
the NF operation should be reviewed next summer in order to evaluate the 
efficiencies resulting from the restructuring programme initiated two years
ago and determine a new base budget for continued operation and development.

There is some good news: GBFC allowed the NF to appoint a data archivist
whose job is to produce an archive of all MERLIN data. This will be 
accomplished in three phases: first the archive database and web interface 
will be created; secondly, an existing pipeline reduction script written in 
AIPS will be used to start populating the database with calibrated data and 
initial images from new observations; finally the archivist will move 
backwards through the existing archive of raw data and produce a full archive. 
The existing rules regarding open access to MERLIN data will remain in place, 
that is: MERLIN data becomes publicly available 12 months after the end of 
the semester in which the observations were made. Dr. Anita Richards has 
been appointed as the archivist from October 1, 1999.

In addition, we welcome Brian Smith to Jodrell Bank. Bryan joins us on an
EU funded programme to perform development work on broadband fibre optic
connections. Specifically, he is modelling the transmission characteristics
of such fibres and assessing the feasibility of transmitting several 
Gbit/sec over lengths of 100s and 1000s of km.


Recent Science: Supernova Remnants and HII regions in NGC2146.
--------------------------------------------------------------

Andrea Tarchi (Universitaet Bonn ) et al.


NGC2146 is a starburst galaxy at a distance of 14.5 Mpc.  The nuclear
region is highly obscured in the optical, but radio observations with
the VLA (Glendenning and Kronberg 1986, BAAS 18,1006) revealed a
populations of about 20 point sources which were interpreted as radio
supernovae (RSN) or supernovae remnants (SNR). MERLIN + VLA observations 
at 5 GHz with 150 mas resolution show that 7 of the sources are resolved 
into diffuse structures, some of which have shell-like morphologies.
Additional 1.4 and 1.6 GHz MERLIN data have shown 9 sources coincident in 
position with the ones detected at 5 GHz and allowed us to compute their 
spectral indices. Three  of them show values consistent with synchrotron 
emission from SNR or RSN, but the others present a very steep inverted 
spectrum. Most of the sources with inverted spectrum are unresolved with 
diameters < 9 pc and T_B > 1000 K, but two are resolved in amorphous 
structures with sizes 10 and 20 pc. We claim that the positive spectral 
index sources are optically thick compact or "ultra dense" HII regions 
with n_e > 10^3 cm^-3, ionized by 10^3 O6 equivalent stars. Such massive 
regions of current star-formation have been seen in other galaxies 
(NGC5253 and Henize 2-10), but, interestingly, are not seen in M82; this 
last galaxy has in fact many similarities with NGC2146. The present 
starburst in NGG2146 may lie in a temporally intermediate phase between 
the very young ones such as in NGC5253 and older examples like M82 
(the ageing of the bursts refers to the sequence presented in Rieke et al.
1988, ApJ 325, 679) The inverted spectra could alternatively be caused by 
strong free-free absorption at 18cm caused by foreground ionized gas with 
very high emission measures (> 10^8 pc cm^-6). The MERLIN observations 
also reveal a very compact steep-spectrum source close to the centre of 
the galaxy which is, up to now, considered a candidate for a RSN, because 
of its steep nonthermal spectrum and its high brightness temperature. 
HI absorption has been detected against this source using MERLIN at 21cm, 
implying a column depth of 25E21 cm^-2.

These observations demonstrate the current ability of MERLIN to
resolve SNR and star-forming regions in increasingly distant galaxies.
The proposed upgrade for MERLIN, including the resurfaced Lovell
Telescope, will allow populations of SNR and HII regions to be studied 
in many more galaxies at greater distances.

Summer Engineering Work
-----------------------

The so-called "shutdown" of the National Facility for about three months
each summer is, in fact, the busiest time of the year for the professional
engineering staff who operate the system. With the telescopes in 24-hour
operation throughout the rest of the year, this is the only opportunity to
undertake much of the essential maintenance and to implement many of the
developments required by our policy of continuous improvement in the
quality of the science output.

Our main task this summer has been the complete replacement of the servo, 
drive and control system on the Darnhall telescope which is one of the 25-m
diameter VLA-style dishes located about 30km from Jodrell Bank. This is part 
of the Restructuring initiative, which also provides for similar work to be 
carried out on the Knockin and Pickmere telescopes in summer 2000. The 
existing (original) control systems on these three telescopes are more than 
20 years old, obsolete and beginning to cause trouble, so the replacement is 
timely. It is interesting to note that even electric motor technology has 
advanced since the telescopes were built, with the result that the new 
motors are substantially smaller than the originals.

At the time of writing, the new hardware is installed and commissioning is
almost complete. The revised telescope control software has also been
written and installed. Testing of the complete system is due to begin
shortly.

Also ready for testing is a new version of the Mk2 telescope control
software which will permit full remote control of the receiver changing
carousel in the focus cabin during the next 5/22GHz observing session
early in the new year. However, final commissioning of this system has
been deferred until after the September VLBI session to permit completion
of improvements to the elevation drive and new focus access arrangements
required by the Health & Safety Executive. The construction of the carousel 
was a direct scientific benefit of the restructuring programme which was 
otherwise aimed at decreasing the running costs of current observations. 
It was designed and commissioned in-house in less than 12 months.

See image of carousel at http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/merlin/newsletter/mkff2.gif

The Lovell Telescope, which is an important element of many National
Facility observations, has been the subject of major engineering work this
summer, including:

- trials of a technique to renew the reflecting surface
- painting of the reflector backing structure
- repairs to the azimuth track
- replacement of critical bearings in all four azimuth drive bogies.

The University has made a bid to the Joint Infrastructure Fund for a grant
to renew the whole of the reflecting surface using the technique
successfully tested this summer. If the bid is successful, we plan to
complete the work in two, extended summer maintenance periods.

The bearings we have replaced were installed when the Telescope was first
constructed in the early 1950s. We hope that the new ones last equally
well.

MERLIN: A Vision for the Future
-------------------------------

As you will read in the biennial report mentioned above we have
a plan for the future development of MERLIN which will, when completed,
transform MERLIN into a new instrument with more than an order of magnitude
improvement over the current sensitivity and three times the current
resolution for high quality imaging. This transformation is especially 
relevant as we enter a new era of high resolution astronomy, with infrared 
adaptive optics already demonstrated on GEMINI and with NGST and ALMA on 
the horizon, MERLIN is uniquely placed to provide complementary radio 
observations. The development plan for MERLIN capitalizes on this position. 

The plan is discussed in more detail at 
          http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/merlin/future.html

Briefly, the development is envisaged in three stages:
1) Array Upgrade: new 12-15 GHz receivers, full frequency flexibility,
   replacement of the Defford telescope
2) Prototype Fibre Link: development and testing of a broad-band fibre
   link between Jodrell Bank and Cambridge
3) Array broad-banding: the linking of all telescopes to Jodrell Bank
   with optical fibres and the installation of a new broad-band correlator.

Along with the concurrent resurfacing of the Lovell telescope, these
upgrades will provide, without significant increase in running costs, 
a 25-fold sensitivity increase at the prime 
operating frequency of 5 GHz with 50 mas resolution and the ability to
carry out reliable imaging at 22-24  GHz with 8 mas resolution. 

The exact sequencing of the components of the development is not
critical, nor is the division into three stages.

The unique combination of resolution, sensitivity and frequency 
coverage of an upgraded MERLIN will open up a spectacular range of new
possibilities in both galactic and extra-galactic astronomy.  In
particular it will bring within reach the thermal and ionized universe
of stars, nebulae and active galaxies in a wavelength regime
unobscured by dust. Stellar astronomy in particular will be
revolutionised by the ability to detect thermal emission from warm gas
and dust with linear resolution of a few AU or better.  MERLIN will
therefore provide complementary science to ALMA (which studies
cold/cool material at somewhat lower resolution) and NGST. Other
MERLIN opportunities include fundamental astrometry with a positional
accuracy < 0.1 mas; planetary searches; studies of star forming
regions and active stars; methanol and excited state OH masers, 
extragalactic SNR and starburst galaxies, AGN and a wide range of 
cosmological studies.
