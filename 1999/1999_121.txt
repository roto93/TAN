Session I on September 10-11, 1999.

Scope of session I:
-------------------

The interplay between massive stars and the ISM plays a fundamental
role in the formation and evolution of galaxies. In addition to
providing ionizing photons and newly synthesized elements, massive
stars inject copious amounts of kinetic energy and momentum to their
surrounding gas through stellar winds and supernovae. Considerable
progress has been made in the recent years on our understanding of the
nature and physics of these feedback mechanisms and their
importance.=20
The aim of this session is to gather specialists from different fields=20
which allow to contribute to a consistent picture of these phenomena.

Scientific program and contributions:
-------------------------------------

The scientific program includes three main topics:
* Stellar content and physics of massive star-forming regions=20
  (giant HII regions, starbursts)=20
* Chemical enrichment by massive stars=20
* The dynamical impact of star formation on the ISM from small to large sca=
les=20

Some review talks will be invited. Oral contributions and posters are welco=
me.
