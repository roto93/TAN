>21 Killed As French Observatory Cable Car Crashes
>
>GRENOBLE, France (Reuters) - Twenty-one people died when a cable car
>taking personnel to an Alpine observatory fell 80 meters (260 feet) in
>southeastern France Thursday, a spokesman for the local
>government representative said.
>
>He said there were no survivors in the car, which was taking day-shift
>staff at 7:30 a.m. to the astronomical observatory on 2,700-meter-high
>(8,900-foot) Pic de Bure above the resort of
>Saint-Etienne-en-Devoluy, near the town of Gap.
>
>The spokesman said that 10 staff of a public works company, five
>scientists of the IRAM astronomical institute based in the French Alpine
>city of Grenoble and telecommunications workers were among the
>victims of the crash.
>
>The cable car was used only for the observatory and no tourists were
>believed to be on board.
>
>It was the most serious cable car accident since 1976, when 42 people
>died in the world's worst such disaster in Cavalese, in the Italian
>Dolomites.
>
>Twenty people died last year when a U.S. air force plane returning from
>Bosnia hit a cable car line, also in Cavalese.
>
>The spokesman said the cause of Thursday's crash was not immediately
>clear. There were conflicting reports that the car got unhooked from the
>cable or that the cable snapped.
>
>A spokesman for the association of cable car operators said the Pic de
>Bure cable car had been built in the 1980s and was regularly checked. He
>said the last thorough check was carried out last year.
