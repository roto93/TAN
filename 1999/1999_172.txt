      Postdoctoral Fellowships in Astrophysics at Princeton University 
      ================================================================


=============================================================================

Lyman Spitzer, Jr. Postdoctoral Fellowship In Theoretical Astrophysics


The Department of Astrophysical Sciences of Princeton University invites
applications for the Lyman Spitzer, Jr. Postdoctoral Fellowship and other
postdoctoral fellowships. 

The Spitzer Fellow is expected to carry out original research in theoretical
astrophysics, either independently or in collaboration with Princeton faculty
or students. Other postdoctoral fellowships in a wide variety of areas of
observational and theoretical astrophysics are also expected to be
available. The principal selection criteria for all fellowships will be
outstanding research accomplishments and promise of future achievement.

Current research areas at Princeton include the formation and evolution of
planets, stars, and galaxies, theoretical and observational studies of the
interstellar medium, large-scale structure, gamma-ray bursts, gravitational
lenses, galactic and solar system dynamics, accretion disks, cosmic background
radiation, numerical hydrodynamics, and plasma astrophysics.  The department
has shared access to the 3.5-meter telescope at Apache Point Observatory, the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and a 64-processor SGI Origin 2000 computer.  For
additional information on the Department and its research activities and
facilities, see http://www.astro.princeton.edu.

The expected starting date for all fellowships is 1 September 2000. The
appointments are for one year, renewable annually based on satisfactory
performance, for a total of up to three years.  Applicants should send a
curriculum vitae, bibliography and statement of research interests, and
arrange to have three letters of recommendation sent by 1 December 1999 to
Prof. S. Tremaine, Chair, Dept. of Astrophysical Sciences, Peyton Hall,
Princeton NJ 08544-1001, USA. Applicants will automatically be considered for
all postdoctoral positions in the department. EEO/AAE.

=========================================================================

Sloan Digital Sky Survey Postdoctoral Fellowships


The Department of Astrophysical Sciences of Princeton University hopes to
offer one or more postdoctoral positions to outstanding young scientists to
work on the analysis and interpretation of data from the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey (SDSS), beginning in September 2000.  This project, which will
eventually map 1/4 of the sky in five optical bands to about 23m and obtain
redshifts for one million galaxies and 100,000 quasars, obtained first light
in imaging mode in June 1998.  Analysis of these first data is now
underway. The postdoctoral fellows will work with Drs. James Gunn, Michael
Strauss, Neta Bahcall, Jill Knapp, Bohdan Paczynski, Robert Lupton, Zeljko
Ivezic, David Schlegel and other department members and members of the SDSS
consortium on the wide variety of research made possible by the data: large
scale structure, galaxy clustering, galaxy properties, quasar properties,
stellar astronomy, and many other topics. They may also work with Dr. Jeremiah
P. Ostriker on cosmological simulations and the interpretation of the SDSS
data on the redshift-space distribution of galaxies.  In particular, we hope
to offer a position to work on stars on the lower main sequence and
substellar objects (brown dwarfs).

These positions are offered subject to the availability of funding. For
additional information on the SDSS, the Department and its research
activities, see http://www.astro.princeton.edu.

Applicants should send a curriculum vitae, bibliography and statement of
research interests, and arrange to have three letters of recommendation sent
by 1 December 1999 to Prof. S. Tremaine, Chair, Dept. of Astrophysical
Sciences, Peyton Hall, Princeton NJ 08544-1001, USA. Applicants will
automatically be considered for other Princeton postdoctoral
positions. EEO/AAE.

Postdoctoral Prize Fellowship In Observational Astronomy - PRINCETON
UNIVERSITY & UNIVERSIDAD CATOLICA DE CHILE


The Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics of Universidad Catolica and
the Department of Astrophysical Sciences at Princeton University invite
applications for a prize fellowship in observational astronomy, sponsored
by Fundacion Andes, to begin in September, 2000. The appointment is for
one year, renewable annually based on satisfactory performance, for up to
three years. The appointment for the first two years will be with Universidad
Catolica in Santiago, with the option of an initial stay of up to three
months at Princeton (in housing provided by the Dept of Astrophysical 
Sciences). The third year of the appointment will be with Princeton.

Chile has the greatest concentration of large telescopes in
the southern hemisphere. Foreign-owned telescopes in Chile must grant 10%
of their observing time to the small community of Chilean astronomers. While
resident at Universidad Catolica, the fellow will qualify as a member of
this community and will be eligible to propose for observing time on all
telescopes in Chile, including ESO's 3.5m NTT and 4x8m VLT, the Gemini 8m, 
Carnegie's 2.5m and Magellan 6.5m, and the 15m SEST. Collaboration with 
astronomers at Catolica and Princeton will be welcomed but not required.

The fellow will have a salary of US$40,000 for the first year, with
a research budget averaging US$15,000 per year. The selected
candidate is expected to apply to Chilean sources for additional
funding. Additional information on research support, etc., can be obtained
from H. Quintana (hquintana@astro.puc.cl) or http://www.astro.puc.cl.

We are seeking an individual with exceptional scientific promise from any
field of observational astronomy, although preference will be given to those
areas in which Princeton and Catolica staff already have active research
interests. Selection, by a joint Princeton-Catolica committee, will be on the
basis of demonstrated excellence. Preference will be given to candidates who
received their Ph.D within the past four years.  Additional information may be
found at http://www.astro.princeton.edu.  These websites also contain 
information on the first joint PUC/Princeton astrophysics conference, 
"Omega", held in Pucon, Chile in January 1999.

Applicants should send a curriculum vitae, bibliography, and research plan,
and arrange for three letters of recommendation to be sent to BOTH Princeton
and Catolica by 1 December 1999.  The research plan should address how the
applicant intends to use the facilities available to both Princeton and
Catolica. Applicants will automatically be considered for other Princeton
postdoctoral positions, but should clearly state in the cover letter that they
wish to be considered for the Princeton/Catolica Prize Fellowship.
Applications should be sent to the following addresses: Prof. S. Tremaine,
Chair, Dept. of Astrophysical Sciences, Peyton Hall, Princeton NJ
08544-1001, USA; and H. Quintana, Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics, P.
Universidad Catolica, Casilla 306, Santiago 22, Chile (e-mail address:
postdoc@astro.puc.cl).  EEO/AAE.
