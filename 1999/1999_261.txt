Dear Tanists,

Have you read the latest issue (Jan 2000) of Sky and Telescope?
Please turn to page 157 and you will see a great photo of the
Milky Way by Wei-Hao Wang.  'Wei-Hao Wang'?  Sounds familiar?
Yes! It's the Wei-Hao Wang we know of: a graduate of Taida (BS) 
and Central (MS) and also a close associate of ASIAA.

Congratulations Wei-Hao.  You made it to the New World!

Yi-Jehng
