      ***********************************************************
      *  EVN OBSERVING OPPORTUNITIES  -  1999 SESSIONS 3 and 4  *
      ***********************************************************

      VLBI observers should note the special observing opportunities
  which will be available with the European VLBI Network during
  Sessions 3 and 4 in 1999.

  *   6 GHz observations are planned for either session 3 or 4,
      giving opportunities for high resolution studies of the
      excited OH radical and methanol molecule using their 
      transitions in this band.

  *   UHF (750 - 1300 MHz) observations are planned for session 3
      (if enough proposals are received) permitting studies of
      HI absorption in systems at a wide range of redshifts.

  *   EVN + MERLIN will be available for L-band (1.4 and 1.7 GHz)
      observations in Session 4. This combined array provides 
      dense, short-baseline (u,v) coverage together with the high
      sensitivity afforded by the large antennas at Effelsberg,
      Jodrell Bank (Lovell) and Westerbork (phased array)


         ****************************************************
         *  AVAILABILTY OF EVN MkIV DATA PROCESSOR AT JIVE  *
         ****************************************************

  The EVN MkIV Data Processor at JIVE is nearing the end of its
  commissioning phase, which will result in an operational (albeit
  basic) MkIV correlator in July 1999. It is open from Session 3 on,
  for EVN proposals which employ basic MkIV/VLBA observing modes, with
  total data rates up to 256 Mb/s (excluding pulsar gating, 2-head and
  320 ips recording). Correlation of Mk3 modes and those which require
  over-sampling (bandwidths < 2 MHz) will be available first for
  observations in Session 4. For session 3, spectral line correlation
  is limited to 512 frequencies per channel, and an aggregate (over
  channels and polarisations) of 1024 per baseline. Further technical
  details from:      H.J. van Langevelde at  huib@jive.nfra.nl
  
  The MPIfR correlator in Bonn is still available for correlation of
  EVN continuum observations recorded in Mk3 modes, but proposers
  should specify the reasons why this correlator is thought suitable
  for the observations.  Such observations must be limited in size
  (see EVN Call for Proposals). The VLBA correlator in Socorro is
  available for a limited number of "EVN-only" experiments. Its use
  will be reserved for those observations which cannot yet be
  correlated at JIVE, as judged by the EVN Program Committee.
