1.  CHILDCARE AT THE CHICAGO AAS MEETING

After considerable investigation and negotiation we have been 
offered what appears to be an excellent contract for childcare 
at the Chicago AAS meeting.  The AAS is checking the details of 
the contract and hopes to approve it within about a week. PLEASE 
NOTE THE CONDITIONAL NATURE of this announcement, which is subject 
to contract approval and room availibility.

The company involved, American Childcare Services, is the 
company recommended by the Hilton hotel where our meeting will be 
held.  You can learn more about them at www.americanchildcare.com.

AS LONG AS WE HAVE 10 OR MORE CHILDREN, the rate will be $6.50 per
child per hour.  That works out to $61.75 per child per day, with 
care provided from 8 am until 5:30 pm.  We expect to accept 
reservations for full or half days, and to provide care all day 
Monday, 31 May through Wednesday, 2 June, and either half day or 
full day on Thursday, 3 June, depending on response.  Since 
participation of at least 10 children is needed to meet the terms 
of the contract, we hope that if you are an AAS parent you will 
think of taking advantage of these arrangements.

FURTHER DETAILS about the nature of care and how to register 
will be provided as soon as the contract is signed.  Look under 
"What's New" on the AAS homepage, and "Childcare" on the Current 
Meeting Page for the announcement as soon as it is available.

For questions, details, or suggestions, please contact Doug Duncan
or Alice Monet (not the AAS Office).

3.  SOUTH POLE OBSERVING OPPORTUNITY
    Proposals Due:  April 20, 1999 

The Antarctic Submillimeter Telescope and Remote Observatory 
(AST/RO) invites proposals for use of the 1.7m telescope during 
the current Austral winter season (now through October 1999).  
Proposals may be submitted by any qualified astronomer and will 
be evaluated by the AST/RO Telescope Allocation Committee based 
on scientific merit.  Scheduled observations will be carried out 
by the AST/RO winterover scientist in residence at South Pole, 
Dr. Roopesh Ojha, who will be considered a scientific collaborator 
on the observations.  SIS receivers at 810 GHz, 460-492 GHz, and 
230 GHz will be available, along with two acousto-optical spectrometers 
(AOS) with 1.07 MHz resolution and 1.1 GHz bandwith, and one AOS with 
44 kHz resolution and 64 MHz bandwidth.  Proposals may be submitted
electronically to:  adair@cfa.harvard.edu, or mailed to:
Dr. Adair P. Lane, AST/RO Project Manager, Harvard-Smithsonian Center 
for Astrophysics, 60 Garden Street, MS-78, Cambridge, MA 02138.
