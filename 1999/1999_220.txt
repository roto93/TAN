Abstract:
We present a wide-field, high dynamic range, high resolution long
wavelength (lambda = 90 cm) VLA image of the Galactic center region.
The image is centered on Sgr A, covers an area of 4^o * 5^o with an
angular resolution of 43'' and has a rms sensitivity of ~ 5 mJy/beam.
The image was constructed from archival VLA data of Pedlar et
al. (1989) and Anantharamaiah et al. (1991) using new 3-D image
restoration techniques.  These 3-D imaging techniques resolve the
problem of non-coplanar baselines encountered at long wavelengths and
yield distortion free imaging of far-field sources with improved
sensitivity.  At lambda = 90 cm the VLA is sensitive to both thermal
and nonthermal emission and the resulting image gives an unprecedented
contextual perspective of the large-scale radio structure in this
unique and complicated region.  We have catalogued over a hundred
sources from this image and present for each source its 90 cm flux
density, position, and size.  For many of the small- diameter sources,
we also derive the 20/90 cm spectral index.  The spectral index as a
function of length along several of the isolated nonthermal filaments
has been estimated and found to be constant.  We have found six new
small-diameter sources as well as several extended regions of emission
that are clearly distinct sources that have not been previously
identified at higher frequencies.  These data are presented as a first
epoch of VLA observations that can be used to search for source
variability in conjunction with a second epoch of observations that
were recently initiated.
