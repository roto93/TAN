The JOINT INSTITUTE FOR VERY LONG BASELINE INTERFEROMETRY IN EUROPE 
     is seeking a candidate for an indefinite appointment as  


                    SENIOR SOFTWARE SCIENTIST


The Joint Institute for VLBI in Europe (JIVE) recently began operating
an advanced 16-station MkIV-standard VLBI data processor (correlator)
to support astronomical observations made with the European VLBI
Network (EVN).

JIVE is located in Dwingeloo in the north of the Netherlands at the
headquarters of the Netherlands Foundation for Research in Astronomy
(the host institute for JIVE). The architecture of the correlator is
based on distributed processing using locally engineered
electronics. Central control and configuration software is being
developed in C++ following object-oriented design philosophies.  The
software runs on UNIX workstations and sets up real-time systems in
the correlator using TCP/IP messages. The software involves
configuration of many different modes of the real-time systems,
complex algorithm implementation, database management and operator
interfaces.

Applications are invited for a position as Senior Software Engineer
at JIVE. Responsibilities of the position include:

  o Take a leading role in overall system design issues and strategic
    decisions in the area of data transfer.
  o Take over the development of embedded software in various parts
    of the system.
  o Contribute to the continuing development of the control software,
    especially in the areas of real-time applications and time critical
    data transfer.


Requirements for the position are:  

  o A degree in software engineering, computer science or
    electronics/physics/astronomy with equivalent experience.
  o Experience with C, C++ or object-oriented techniques.  
  o Experience with inter-process communication (TCP/IP and UNIX 
    sockets) and multi-threading code.
  o Previous experience with real-time systems (PSOS/HP-RT) are an
    advantage.
  o Ability to work independently.  
  o Good communication skills in English and Dutch (or prepared to
    learn Dutch if not a native speaker).

The position is available immediately. Appointment is offered for two
years in the first instance with the possibility of an indefinite
position thereafter. The appointee will be in the formal employ of the
Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO), salary will be
in scale 11, which begins at 72.000,- guilders per annum, (gross
salary).


Relocation expenses and assistance with finding accommodation will be
provided.  Applications must be sent to Ms. F.H. Wekking, Personnel
Officer, Joint Institute for VLBI in Europe, P.O. Box 2, 7990 AA
Dwingeloo, the Netherlands by 15 February 2000, and quote reference number
JIVE00-01.

Further information can be obtained from Dr. H.J. van Langevelde,
phone:+31 521 596515, fax:+31 521 597332, email:langevelde@jive.nl.

Applications should include a curriculum vitae and a statement of
experience in relation to the requirements for the position.
Applicants should provide a list of up to two persons prepared to
provide a reference.
