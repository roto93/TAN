----------------------------------------------------------------------
  
                          MEETING FORMAT

The meeting will consist of invited talks on the main topics, which comprise
a hefty portion of the science which ALMA will address:
 Investigation of galaxies near the time of their formation at very 
        high redshift; 
 Detection and study of planets around nearby stars; 
 Study of star formation by, for example, high-resolution submillimeter 
        observations of protostars, protoplanetary disks, and outflows; and 
 Study of the origin, distribution and evolution of the elements and 
        their isotopes; 

Posters will be displayed on boards in the reception hall outside the auditorium
and remain up for the duration of the meeting, 8:00 am, 7 October through
7:00 pm, 8 October.  Coffee and snacks will be provided in this area in the
mornings and the afternoons.  A list of poster paper titles is available at:

                        Abstracts and Proceedings

Please provide an abstract for your poster.  These will be available on-line
and referenced at the ADS astronomy electronic literature service. LaTeX
style forms are available at the WWW site; a booklet of posters will be made
available at the meeting.

REMINDER: Abstracts of your talks or posters are DUE NO LATER THAN:
*************************************** 
September 12th
***************************************
for publication in the booklet.   The booklet which will be 
made available to participants at the Conference and electronically on the Web 
site of the Conference about one week in advance. A copy of the Conference 
Abstracts will be provided to the Astrophysics Data System (ADS).  These
will have to be prepared in LaTeX following instructions that are on the
WWW.

We have proposed to PASP that they publish the Proceedings.  This will include
ten pages for invited articles and four pages for poster contributions.
The deadline for submitting manuscripts is 21 December 1999.
To help the editors with the preparation of the Object index, it is asked 
that the authors provide separately the list of individual astronomical 
sources discussed in their paper.

In order for these proceedings to appear as soon as possible
to reflect the current status of the field,  the deadline for 
reception of all electronic files will be :
*************************************

21 December 1999

*************************************
 
In order to
keep the registration fee low, we have not included a copy of the book in
the registration fee.  We will, however, take orders for the Proceedings
once we have acceptance of our proposal from the PASP.
The cost per volume is $46.80 for each participant, plus 
$6.00 shipping/handling for US or foreign SURFACE MAIL;
or $9.00 Canada/Mexico AIR MAIL; or $15.00 Foreign AIR
MAIL.  Please note that volumes mailed SURFACE MAIL 
take 2 to 8 weeks to arrive, depending on destination.  
Typically, volumes are mailed out approximately 70 days 
after we receive the camera-ready hard copy.  Further, the 
cost of the book to each participant is the same regardless 
of the number of pages contained therein.   If a person is a 
nonparticipant and is not a member of the ASP, the cost of 
the book is $52.00. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
                      Accommodations

The hotel for the conference is the Omni Shoreham Hotel, located
off Connecticut Avenue in Rock Creek Park.  This is situated about 1.3
miles from the Carnegie Institution.  One can either
walk, or take the Metro subway one stop from Woodley Park to Dupont 
Circle followed by a short walk, or ride a bus.
Parking near the conference center is extremely limited, while parking at the
hotel is available for guests at $14 per day.

A special rate, 2/3 the normal rate,  has been negotiated by AUI with 
the hotel.  When reserving a room, please be sure to mention that you 
want a room within the AUI block.  You may contact the hotel at 
Telephone: (202) 234-0700
or Facsimile: (202) 756-5145
The number of rooms at this special rate is limited in number and subject
to availability.  BE SURE TO RESERVE A ROOM BEFORE 10 September 1999!
Washington is very popular during October and rooms can be difficult to find.

A map is available at the meeting WWW site.  The hotel is denoted by the flagged
address; the conference site by the orange number '1.'  

Washington D.C. is served by three major airports.  Dulles International
Airport to the west handles many international flights, with convenient
ground connections to the city.  National Airport lies just across the
Potomac from the Mall, with convenient Metro access to the city.
Baltimore-Washington International (BWI) Airport lies to the north, and has
convenient rail access to the city.  BWI is served by Icelandic Airways
and by Southwest Airlines, along with most major airlines, and 
frequently boasts the most reasonably priced
fares.  More details will be sent in a final announcement.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
                      Social Events

Members of Congress, their staffers, and constituents will be invited to
a reception in the House Science Committee Room at the U. S. Capitol
from 5:30 to 7:30 pm on 6 October.  Owing to the size of the room, this
will be by invitation only.  If you would like to introduce your
representative in Congress to the ALMA project, please invite your
representative and accompany him/her to the reception.  Please let us
know that you have done this.  A list of Representatives on appropriate
committees may be found at:
http://www.mma.nrao.edu/science/congress.html
The Representatives and/or their staff are, of course, most welcome at the
meeting.

A press conference will be held at the Carnegie Institution on the morning
of 7 October to introduce the ALMA project to the media.  The subjects
to be covered are under development.

A reception and banquet for meeting participants will be held at the
Omni-Shoreham Hotel on the evening of 7 October.
