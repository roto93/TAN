Dear subscriber:

the abstract we sent out yesterday was corrupted, i.e. two lines were 
deleted because of two tildes that confused the mail program.

Thanks again to those who informed us about the error.

Title    : Three New Supernova Remnant OH Masers Near the Galactic 
           Center: Evidence for Large Scale Maser Emission from 
           Supernova Remnants

Abstract:
A survey of the inner 8^o * 1^o of the Galactic plane toward the
Galactic Center has been carried out at the 1720 MHz transition of the OH
molecule using the VLA in its D configuration with a resolution of
 ~70''*45''. The detection of compact 1720 MHz OH masers associated
with three supernova remnants G357.7+0.3, G1.13-0.1 (Sgr D) and
G1.4-0.1 as well as new extended maser line emission from G357.7+0.3
and G357.7-0.1 (the Tornado Nebula) were then followed up by A-array
observations with spectral and spatial resolutions of 0.3 km/sec and
 ~3''*2'', respectively.
The 1720 MHz OH maser line emission is considered to be a powerful
shock diagnostic and is collisionally pumped by H_2 molecules at the
site where C-type supernova shocks drive into adjacent molecular
clouds. The new observations show clear evidence of extended features
coincident with compact and bright masers, the best example of which
is a coherent feature over a scale of about 20 pc surrounding the
shell of the SNR G357.7+0.3.  We argue that this remarkable feature is
an OH maser and is physically associated with the remnant. This
implies that the ambient molecular cloud is uniform in its density and
temperature with restricted range of pumping conditions and survives
the passage of a large-scale shock front.
