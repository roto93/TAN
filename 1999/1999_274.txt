-------------------------------------------------
AAS 195th Meeting
11-15 January 2000
Atlanta, GA

1. STILL NEED AN ATLANTA HOTEL ROOM   

2. INDUSTRIAL JOB CENTER CANCELLED
-------------------------------------------------
1. ADDITIONAL ATLANTA PROPERTIES
As previously advertised, the Hyatt Regency Atlanta
is sold out.

The three overflow properties (Days Inn, Hampton and
Wyndham) that are within walking distance from the 
Hyatt are just about sold out; especially for Tuesday, 
11 January.

Two additional properties (Embassy and Underground)
have been secured and have plenty of rooms.   

If you made reservations with the Hyatt
after 5 December and have not received a 
confirmation, please call the Hyatt (404-577-1234) 
to see if you have a room.  The Hyatt will automatically 
forward any unfilled room requests to the overflow 
properties.

If you are making your reservations now, please 
call the following hotels directly.  Ask for the 
AAS rate.  This is important for tracking the room 
pickup and planning future meeting needs.


Embassy Suites
275 Marietta Street
404-223-2300

$110/single, 130/double.  Includes complimentary full 
breakfast, evening reception and use of fitness center.  
About 5 blocks from the Hyatt.


The Suite Hotel Underground
54 Peachtree at Alabama
404-223-5555

$110/single/double.  About 7 blocks from the Hyatt.

---------------------------------------------------------
2.  INDUSTRIAL JOB CENTER CANCELLED

Due to the poor response from industrial employers, our 
career services partner, the Career Services Division of
the American Institute of Physics, has opted to cancel the 
industrial employment center at this AAS meeting. The AAS
will try to have an industrial job center at a future AAS 
meeting. 

This industrial cancellation will not affect the regular 
AAS Job Center.  The AAS Job Center will operate as normal.
