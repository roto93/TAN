SCIENTIST - AIPS++ PROJECT

The AIPS++ Project is an international collaboration by a consortium
of radio observatories with the purpose of developing a software
package for the processing of radio astronomical data. The first
public release of AIPS++ was recently made. More information on AIPS++
is available from the AIPS++ home page at http://aips2.nrao.edu

The AIPS++ Project has a job vacancy at the National Radio Astronomy
Observatory headquarters in Socorro, New Mexico. The duties will be to
participate in the development of advanced visualization capabilities
in AIPS++ building on top of the existing Display Library and other
AIPS++ infrastructure. Development will focus on the display of
information in two complementary domains, connected by a transform
(such as Fourier transform or self-calibration) that is itself
implemented in the AIPS++ Library. The position is funded by a grant
from the NSF and is funded for three years.

Substantial experience in astronomical data reduction is required.
Experience with radio-interferometry, and visualization is
desirable. Knowledge of C++, Unix and experience of working in a large
distributed software project would both be advantageous. Pursuit of
research in either astronomy or astronomical techniques is expected
(25% time).

Socorro is a small historic town (pop. 9000) in the mid Rio Grande
valley of New Mexico. More information can be obtained from the
Socorro Home Page at http://www.socorro.com

Application deadline is February 1, 2000.

Further information is available for NRAO from the NRAO Home Page
http://www.nrao.edu 

Applications should be addressed to A. Lewis, Personnel Office,
NRAO, P.O. Box 0, Socorro, NM or alewis@nrao.edu .
