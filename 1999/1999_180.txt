                         Second Circular 

                THE 9TH MIDWEST RELATIVITY MEETING 
                   
            The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
                           
                       Nov 12 and 13, 1999


The 9th Midwest Relativity Meeting will be held at the University of
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign on Nov 12 and 13, 1999.

In the tradition of the Regional Relativity Meetings in the US, this
will be an open meeting.  All interested researchers and students in
all areas of gravitational physics, are invited to attend and
contribute talks on their current research. As a regional meeting,
many participants will be from the US Midwest, but all are welcome.
There will be no plenary talks.  Unless attendance is unexpectedly
high, we will allot equal time (probably between 10 and 15 minutes) to
everyone who requests to speak and we will not have parallel sessions.

The Local Organizing Committee consists of Thomas Baumgarte and 
Stuart Shapiro.  Please see 

	http://www.physics.uiuc.edu/groups/relativity/MRM9/ 

for further information on the meeting, accommodations and
registration.  Note that two of the conference hotels require
reservations by Oct 11, so we encourage you to make your travel plans
early and to REGISTER NOW at the above website.

We are looking forward to seeing you in Urbana this fall,

Best regards,

Thomas Baumgarte and Stuart Shapiro
