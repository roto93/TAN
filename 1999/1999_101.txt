Subject: 2MASS 1999 Spring Incremental Data Release

Dear Colleague:

We would like to announce that the 2MASS first large Incremental
Data Release is now open for public access.  You can access the 
release data products from the IPAC/2MASS Web site at 
http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/2mass/ or directly from the 
NASA/Infrared Science Archive site at 
http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/.

The 2MASS 1999 Spring Incremental Data Release consists of a
Point Source Catalog containing 20.2 million objects, an Extended 
Source Catalog containing 73,980 resolved sources, and 233,979 
compressed 512x1024 pixel (1"/pixel) images, covering about 2,483 
square degrees of the northern sky.  Also provided are tools for 
a) obtaining full resolution (non-compressed) "postage-stamp" 
images for the Extended Source Catalog objects, and b) for 
determining whether a specified position is included in the release 
area.

The 2MASS webpage contains general information about this data 
release, including sky coverage, images of interesting objects in 
the release, catalog characteristics, etc.  Also available 
on the 2MASS site is an Explanatory Supplement for the release.
Assistance with the release is available via the 2MASS Help Desk 
at 2mass@ipac.caltech.edu.

A DVD-ROM containing the release Catalogs will also be produced
in the near future, if interest is significant.
