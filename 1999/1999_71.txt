The Hubble Space Telescope has a Hubble Heritage Project, in which
fascinating HST WFPC2 images are selected for feature presentations.
The images of 30 Doradus from my Cycle 5 program were selected
for April.  It was unveiled yesterday.  My story of 30 Doradus was
included; however, it is not easy to find it from the homepage of 
the STScI (http://www.stsci.edu).  

If you are interested in a little light reading at the lunch break,
here is the URL of my story:
     http://heritage.stsci.edu/public/apr1/h301chu.html

Enjoy!  Happy Easter!  

(Speaking of Easter...  my HST WFPC2 image of the hypernova remnant
NGC5471B looks just like an Easter egg, but I can't show it to you 
until after the HEAD Press Release on April 12... Stay tuned.) 


Cheers,
You-Hua Chu
