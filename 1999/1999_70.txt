Dear Friends of astronomy,

During the annual meeting of the astronomical society at Taipei observatory, we 
will organize a session to present research results. It will be held around 
15:00-17:00.  It has been decided that all results will be presented as posters 
in the meeting area.  If you are interested to present one, please:

1. email me a title by 17:00 April 6 (TUESDAY), English only.
   (typhoon@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw)
   
2. bring your poster (90x60cm HxW, in Chinese or English) on 4/11 and submit it 
to the registration desk by 10:00 am.  

3. We will display your poster (if the content is appropriate for the meeting) 
beginning noon near the meeting area.

4. You are requested to be near your posters around 15:00 to explain your 
results. 

Sincerely,

Typhoon Lee
