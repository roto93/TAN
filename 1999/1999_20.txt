Symposium announcement:

                    THE LEGACY OF J.C. KAPTEYN
          An overview of Kapteyn's influence on astronomy
           Groningen, The Netherlands, June 9 - 11, 1999


AIMS
====

     The University of Groningen was founded in 1614 and consequently
will be celebrating in 1999 its 385th anniversary. In this year we are
less than 2 years away from the end of the twentieth century and the
beginning of the third millennium. When the twentieth century started,
Kapteyn had just completed publication (between 1896 and 1900) of the
"Cape Photographic Durchmusterung", a work that established his
international fame and leadership. Kapteyn's influence on astronomy in
the Netherlands is still alive; in fact it may be safely stated that the
success of Dutch astronomy in this century has for a major part been
derived from Kapteyn through his work, his students and his strong
commitment to international collaboration. 

     As part of the University's celebration of its lustrum a symposium
will be held which is organized by both the Kapteyn Astronomical
Institute and the History Department. 

     The primary aim is to concentrate on issues related to the
sociology of Kapteyn's influence. It would be of interest to try to
trace the continuation of Kapteyn's initiatives in research, campaigns
and organizations by concentrating on both persons and themes. 

     The symposium will last three days with six half-day sessions,
mainly made up of invited contributions. Speakers include W.E. Krul,
W.T. Sullivan, W.R. de Sitter, M. Schmidt, D. DeVorkin, R. Smith,
G. Gilmore, M.A.C. Perryman, L. Woltjer and various members of the
Scientific Organizing Committee. The final program will leave ample
time for discussion. The symposium should be attended by an
international audience consisting of both astronomers with a
historical interest and historians of astronomy and natural science. 

     More information about this symposium and how to register can be
obtained by visiting the symposium's web-page or sending an e-mail or
letter to the LOC.
