1.  ROOMS IN CHICAGO

The Hilton Chicago and Towers no longer has rooms available for
the AAS Centennial Meeting.   Additional rooms have just been
secured at the Hyatt Printers Row Hotel, just a few blocks from the 
Hilton.  Rooms are $129. Reservations may be made by calling 
800-233-1234 or 312-986-1234.

2.  UCP JOURNALS PUBLICATION DELAYS
    Julie Steffen, Astronomy Publications Manager, UCP
 
Starting with the 1999 issues of The Astrophysical Journals 
and The Astronomical Journal, the University of Chicago Press 
has changed to a more efficient and economical typesetting 
technology.  The unfortunate side effect of this is that we 
have been publishing two to four weeks behind schedule since 
this change was made.  The new system is now under control, 
and we apologize for any inconvenience these delays may have 
caused in the astronomical community.
 
The May issues of the journals will begin posting to the web 
and mailing this week.  We expect the ApJ to be back on schedule 
by the end of June, i.e., posting and mailing approximately one 
week before the cover date.  Readers will soon notice shorter 
delays for the AJ and the ApJ Supplement Series as well.  The 
ApJ Letters have not been affected by this change in technology, 
because they are typeset in house at UCP. 
 
We thank you for your patience during this transition period.

3.  HOW TO WRITE A WINNING PROPOSAL!

Communicating your ideas for research through an effective
proposal can be a challenge.  Competition is keen, oversubscription
prevails, and the stakes can be high.  Come to the AAS Business
Meeting to hear a panel of experienced scientists  share facts,
insight and wisdom to demystify the process of writing a successful
proposal.  Sethanne Howard (Program Director for Extragalactic 
Astronomy and Cosmology, NSF), Guenter Riegler (Director of 
Program Management Division, NASA), Rob Kennicutt (U. Arizona), 
and Mike Shull (U. Colorado)  have experience with panels and 
peer reviews,  TACS and selection committees.  They will explain 
procedures, identify opportunities frequently overlooked, offer 
hints, and answer questions to minimize your chances of rejection 
slip shock. 

The AAS Business Meeting will be held Tuesday, 1 June, 1:00pm, 
Chicago Hilton, Continental Ballroom A.

4.  AASTEX UPGRADE AVAILABLE ON 20 MAY

A new release of AASTeX will be available on 20 May 1999.

The package and its documentation is being finalized at
this time; you can read the release notes now, if you wish.
The resource name remains the same.

    http://www.aas.org/publications/aastex/

Re-iterating the highlight from my March Newsletter remarks,
there are two versions of this upgrade: one called v5.0 that
runs only under LaTeX 2e, and one called v4.1 that will run
on LaTeX v2.09 installations.

While we made modest additions to the markup, you should
realize that for purposes of electronic submission to the
AAS journals, v4.0 manuscripts will still be acceptable.

5.  AASTEX TEAM AT CHICAGO AAS MEETING
    Chris Biemesderfer

The AASTeX Team will be at the University of Chicago
Press AAS Journals exhibit booth on Tuesday morning 1 June 
at the AAS meeting.  This is an opportunity to meet the 
folks who can help you with your AASTeX manuscripts, and 
to thank them for past assistance.

You can also address your, um, concerns about AASTeX to
its designer.  But mostly I want to invite you to meet
the people who support you in preparing articles for the
journals.

6.  DECADAL SURVEY PUBLIC TOWN MEETING

The Astronomy and Astrophysics Survey Committee (AASC)
will hold a Public Town Meeting in conjunction with the AAS
Centennial Meeting in Chicago on Tuesday, June 2nd at 8:15 p.m.
in the Waldorf Room of the Hilton Hotel. The AASC Co-Chair,
Chris McKee will present a status report, and then the chairs
of the nine panels under the AASC will convene separate
break-out public sessions.
 
Contact Joel Parriott (jparriot@nas.edu) for more details.

7.  AAS DECADAL ISSUES DISCUSSION WEB FORUM UPDATE
    Lee Anne Willson, lwillson@iastate.edu

Four new Cross Panel Working Groups have been set up; these are:

    National Observatories (Frank Bash, Chair)
    Planetary Astrophysics (David Jewitt, Chair)
    Laboratory Astrophysics (Charles Alcock, Chair)
    Massive Surveys (Tom Prince, Chair)

New threads are being added to the forum corresponding to these topics.

There is now an "easy-access" summary page
(http://www.aas.org/decadal/summary.html) which allows you to 
scan rapidly for those messages you would be interested in 
reading in detail.  All the contributions to the forum have been 
thoughtful, and we encourage you to visit the forum and see what 
your colleagues have written. 

There is now also a page of links to relevant sites
(http://www.aas.org/decadal/links.html) which includes NOAO 
long-range planning and information regarding NGST.  If you know 
of any other links that should be provided here, please contact 
the DID forum moderator, Lee Anne Willson, at willson@aas.org.

Reminder:  The web forum will continue only until 15 June, since 
the Astronomy and Astrophysics Survey Committee is operating on 
a tight schedule.  If you have been considering sending in a 
contribution, sooner is better.

8. COMMUNITY INPUT SOUGHT ON
   NASA SUN EARTH CONNECTION SYSTEM PLAN
   Redistributed from SolarNews 1999 No. 12
 
NASA's Office of Space Science plans to establish a Sun Earth 
Connection Data System (SECDS) as a distributed active archive 
environment for the management and dissemination to the general 
research community of NASA mission data covering solar physics 
and space plasma physics. Components of the SECDS will be selected 
through peer reviewed solicitations to the community.
 
In anticipation of the establishment of the SECDS, the Technical 
Working Group of the NASA Space Science Data System (SSDS) developed 
a set of recommendations to NASA regarding the data needs of the 
community and an architecture for a community-based SECDS. The report,
drafted by a committee of scientists meeting at River Bend, Texas, 
is available on the SSDS web pages at
http://ssds.nasa.gov/info/secds/river_bend.html

It is vital to the success of the new SECDS that it be responsive 
to the needs of the community, and that the community be directly 
included from the outset. Therefore, we solicit your comments on 
these recommendations and ask that they be sent to ssds_twg@stsci.edu. 
This address will forward your comments to NASA Headquarters 
(J. Bredekamp) and to the members of the SSDS Technical Working Group 
and the River Bend committee. Comments will be most valuable if 
they arrive on or before 28 May 1999.

9.  2MASS DATA RELEASE
    Schuyler Van Dyk

The Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) announces the public 
availability  of its first large Incremental Data Release.  
The release data products  can be accessed from the IPAC/2MASS 
Web site at  http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/2mass/ or directly 
from the  NASA/Infrared Science Archive site at
http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/.

The 2MASS 1999 Spring Incremental Data Release consists of a
Point Source Catalog containing 20.2 million objects, an 
Extended Source Catalog containing 73,980 resolved sources, 
and 233,979 compressed 512x1024  pixel (1"/pixel) images, 
covering about 2,483 square degrees of the  northern sky.  
Also  provided are tools for a) obtaining full resolution 
(non-compressed) "postage-stamp" images for the Extended Source 
Catalog  objects, and b) for determining whether a specified 
position is included  in the release area.

The 2MASS webpage contains general information, including sky 
coverage, and documentation about this data release.  Assistance 
with the release is available via the 2MASS Help Desk at
2mass@ipac.caltech.edu.

The Two Micron All Sky Survey is a joint project of U. Mass.
and the IPAC, funded by NASA and NSF.
