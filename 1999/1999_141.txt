  I. General Introduction
  -----------------------

     Dear colleagues,


 The ``Astronomisches Rechen-Institut'' (in short ARI) is the place in
 astronomy where history and forefront science in the fields of
 stellar dynamics and astrometry meet. Its origin dates
 back to the Royal Prussian Calendar Patent (see below) 
 issued on May 10, 1700, in Berlin. 

 The year 2000 is also a good timing to hold again a scientific
 conference on new theoretical and observational results on the structure 
 and dynamics of the solar neighbourhood, the Galaxy as a whole, the centre
 of the Milky Way, and its open and globular star clusters.
 Since the last large conference on star cluster dynamics, the IAU
 Symposium 174 in 1996, high-resolution observations
 with new-generation telescopes have provided us with a wealth
 of data and new constraints for kinematical and dynamical 
 modelling. The investigation of the structure, kinematics and dynamics of the
 solar neighbourhood has much in common with that of
 star clusters - from the use of Jeans equations
 to the importance of two-body scattering.
 The same holds for the Galactic Centre,
 where a spectacular massive black hole dominates the
 dynamics and which can be seen as a prototype and the
 nearest active galactic nucleus to study. 

 In the field of collisionless galactic dynamics,
 one of the recent conference highlights is the
 Rutgers conference, in New Jersey, which in 2000 will already be two
 years ago. This is a long time span considering the present
 number of researchers in the field and the quick development of
 e.g. observations of galactic nuclei, disks and bulges.
 The study of stability and evolution of the collisionless components of
 the Galaxy, such as the bulge, thick and thin disk,
 in most cases require large numerical N-body studies.
 This is also the case for collisional constituents, such as
 the nucleus of the Milky Way and open or globular clusters,
 using, however, different physical and numerical features.
 There has always been a considerable personal and methodological overlap
 between the two regimes. Nevertheless it is considered as very
 useful to bring the two stellar dynamical communities
 together. 

 Astrometry, i.e. the acquisition of precise data of stellar
 positions and motions and their proper statistical and
 astronomical processing is a fundamental ingredient for
 many astrophysical studies, in particular stellar dynamics.
 The use of such data from the HIPPARCOS astrometry satellite and
 their scientific use for the derivation of velocity distribution 
 functions, mass and luminosity functions and stellar binarity
 properties in star clusters is one of the major research
 fields at ARI. A successor satellite mission to HIPPARCOS
 called DIVA is planned here.
 
 ARI today hosts groups working on the structure and dynamics
 of the local galaxy, the solar neighbourhood, spiral structure,
 on dynamics of star clusters and galactic nuclei, including the
 use of special-purpose GRAPE and general-purpose massively
 parallel computers for direct N-body simulations.

 To conclude, ARI and its 300-year anniversary are a fascinating
 place to bring together stellar dynamicists working on different
 objects but with many common grounds, to foster exchange and
 dissemination of expertise and to bring about a momentum to
 keep theory and stellar dynamics competitive with the enormous
 increase of observational data, in a timely and well-focused
 conference.

 --------------------------------------------------------------

 II. Call for Participation
 -------------------------

 We would like to invite all interested colleagues to participate 
 in this conference. A pre-registration through our 
 web-site is possible:
 
 http://www.ari.uni-heidelberg.de/star2000

 A preliminary programme has been compiled for the above
 web-site. It lists distinguished review speakers, who have agreed to
 participate. We will provide further slots for
 shorter invited and contributed talks and ample poster 
 space. 

 Proceedings will be published after the conference at a well-
 established publisher (Springer or PASP conference series).
 It is our aim to provide at least one page space in the
 proceedings for every poster. While we want to select
 and highlight invited short and review talks, it is our
 policy to be as open as conference organisation allows
 in the acceptance policy of participants and contributions.

 Please note, however, that we want to focus the conference
 rather sharply on the stellar-dynamical aspects as 
 mentioned in the title. For your orientation we have
 defined three sub-topics:

 1) star clusters, dense stellar systems, N-body simulations

 Pure and applied stellar dynamics, effects of mass loss,
 rotation, stellar evolution, internal kinematics, 
 applications for galactic nuclei star clusters, hardware
 and software development

 2) solar neighbourhood

 the local galactic potential, mass function and kinematics
 of the solar neighbourhood, galactic evolutionary effects probed
 in the local environment

 3) structure of the Milky Way

 the galactic satellites, the disk, bulge, halo connection,
 the centre of the galaxy

 Timelines:

 Second Announcement                           October 1999
 Poster and Announcement sent to Institutes    October 1999

 Communications will be done in electronic form as far
 as possible.
 --------------------------------------------------------------

 III. Historical Remarks
 -----------------------

 For those interested we provide here a few more words on the 
 history, since this cannot easily be found in published papers:

 The Astronomisches Rechen-Institut was founded in Berlin and
 resided there for 245 years. It originates from the calendar
 patent of May 10, 1700 (see copy on 

 http://www.ari.uni-heidelberg.de/geschichte/pat_gross.jpeg

 In this edict, electoral duke Friedrich III.
 (who became later King Friedrich I. of Prussia) granted a
 privilege to the academy of sciences to be the sole editor
 of calendars. For a long time the academy of sciences financed
 all their astronomers by the income from the calendar patent.
 The main duty was to edit an astronomically correct calendar.
 Nowadays ARI still computes and publishes the annual database
 for calendars in the Federal Republic of Germany. If you happen
 to see setting or rising times of Moon or Sun in a German calendar,
 it has most probably been taken from a publication of this institute.

 ARI was connected with the Berlin observatory, and only 1896
 it obtained its full independence. While its name changed
 several times, its identity can still be traced back over the
 300 years. The webserver of our institute contains a lot
 of bibliographical and historical data based on scanned
 original documents, dating back to these old times. 
 (check e.g. the databases such as ARIBIB or ARIPRINT on
 our home page). In 1944 the institute was brought under
 direct command of the German Navy, evacuated to
 a little village in Saxonia. Finally, in 1945, it was brought
 to the head quarter of the US army in Europe: Heidelberg!

 So as you see the ARI has a rich and colourful history, and 
 it is a pleasure for us not only to work at such a historic 
 place, but moreover, to host the leading stellar dynamicists 
 of the world in the conference star2000.
 Not the least to mention that Heidelberg is a nice and 
 tourist attraction with its castle and old city, it is
 also a successful centre of German astrophysics,
 with four other institutes working on astrophysical topics
 (MPIA, LSW, ITA, MPIK).
 We are looking forward to an inspiring, communicative and friendly 
 conference and hope you will enjoy and benefit from it.
