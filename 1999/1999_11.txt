GALAXIES CAME BEFORE CLUSTERS
Astronomers at the University of Birmingham, using observations from the
orbiting ROSAT X-ray telescope, have discovered evidence that the afterglow
of galaxy formation can be seen today in the hot gas trapped in groups of
galaxies. The high temperatures seen in this gas can be explained by the
energy released from the supernova explosions accompanying galaxy formation,
but only if galaxies formed *before* they grouped together into galaxy
clusters. This resolves a long-standing debate in cosmology over whether
structures in the Universe have formed "bottom-up" (i.e. small objects
forming first and then clustering) or "top-down" (large objects form first
and then fragment). The results are published in the Jan.14th issue of
Nature.

The Universe has a hierarchical structure: stars are grouped into galaxies,
and most galaxies (including the Milky Way) congregate in small groups or
large clusters which may contain up to thousands of galaxies. The space
between the galaxies in these groups and clusters is not empty, but is
filled with gas at a temperature of many millions of degrees Celsius, which
radiates X-rays (see Figures).

A team led by Dr. Trevor Ponman of Birmingham University has used the X-ray
telescope on board the German/UK/US ROSAT satellite to image these X-rays,
and to compare the hot gas in small groups to that in large clusters. Most
current cosmological theories predict that as the Universe expands, galaxies
clump together to form groups, which in turn merge together to form
clusters. In this picture the hot gas in small groups should look just like
a scaled-down version of that in large clusters. In practice, the ROSAT
images show that this is not the case. The gas in galaxy groups is hotter
than expected, and is spread out more thinly than that in clusters, so that
they shine less brightly in X-rays than would be expected. These differences
in the hot gas are almost certainly due to the energy injected into it when
the galaxies formed.

The formation of galaxies should be a spectacular process. As large numbers
of stars are formed, the most massive of them live only a short time before
exploding as supernovae, releasing large bursts of energy. This should heat
the gas within the young galaxies to tens of millions of degrees, giving it
enough energy to escape altogether, as high speed `galaxy winds'. These
stream out of galaxies, heating the gas which surrounds them. This extra
heat has little effect in large clusters (where the gas gets very hot
anyway, due to the large amount of energy released as gas falls in the
strong gravitational field), but in small groups it is very significant, and
pushes the gas outward, causing the differences in X-ray brightness which
are seen in the ROSAT images.

Calculations by the team, Drs. Trevor Ponman and Damian Cannon from the
University of Birmingham, and Dr. Julio Navarro from the University of
Victoria in Canada, show that energy has a bigger effect if it is released
into the gas before the galaxy groups formed. (It is harder to push gas out
of a group than it is to stop it falling in in the first place.) In fact,
the amount of energy released when galaxies form could only account for the
observations if it had heated the gas before the group was present. In other
words, galaxies must have formed before groups and clusters.

This epoch of violent heating also explains why most galaxy formation
stopped billions of years ago - there is plenty of gas left, but this does
not generally form more galaxies, since most of it is now too hot to
collapse under gravity and form stars. Most of the normal matter in the
Universe has therefore been left in the form of hot gas filling
intergalactic space.

CAPTIONS TO ILLUSTRATIONS
(illustrations available on http://www.sr.bham.ac.uk/public

An optical image of a nearby group of galaxies, and the same group seen in
X-rays with the ROSAT X-ray telescope. The scale of the two images is the
same. The very hot gas imaged by ROSAT is invisible with optical telescopes,
but actually contains more material than all the galaxies combined. In this
very hot (10 million degree) gas, we see the afterglow of the violent events
which accompanied the birth of the galaxies.

NOTE ON ROSAT
The ROSAT Observatory is an orbiting satellite carrying telescopes which can
image the sky in the X-ray and Extreme Ultraviolet bands. It was built by a
consortium of German, British and American universities. The mission has
been extremely successful, and since its launch in 1990, has imaged well
over 100,000 cosmic X-ray sources, many of them for the first time. The
satellite operated far beyond its nominal two year lifetime, and was finally
switched off only weeks ago, just before Christmas.
