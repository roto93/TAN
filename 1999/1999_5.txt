        EVN JOINT OBSERVATIONS WITH OTHER ANTENNAS AND ARRAYS

Proposers may request EVN antennas together with other telescopes and arrays.
Combined EVN+MERLIN projects add the short MERLIN array baselines, as well as
providing VLBI baselines to the CAMBRIDGE antenna. Antennas of the NASA DSN, 
especially Robledo (Madrid), are available for a few projects each session
requiring very high sensitivity. GLOBAL projects add the NRAO VLBA and/or
other US antennas, creating an array of up to 20 elements, ideal for very 
high dynamic range imaging, and "snap-shot" observations of many sources. 
==============================================================================

                    SUBMITTING  EVN  PROPOSALS
                    ==========================

WHEN TO SUBMIT - AND AFTERWARDS
===============================
Proposals must be received by 1st Feb, June or Oct. A list of Project Codes
and Principle Investigators for all proposals received will be posted on the
EVN WWW Home Page under "EVN Program Committee" shortly after the deadline.
All communication between the Proposer(s), and the EVN Program Committee
or Scheduler will be via the Contact Author designated in the proposal. The
results from proposal review will be communicated after the next meeting of
the EVN Program Committee, and will be SENT BY EMAIL unless otherwise 
requested in the proposal Abstract.

WHERE TO SUBMIT
===============
a) An EVN proposal is any request for 2 or more EVN antennas for observations 
   to be scheduled during an EVN observing session. All EVN proposals, 
   including EVN-alone, EVN+MERLIN, EVN+DSN, EVN+VLBA, etc, must be sent to:
            Dr. R. Schwartz, EVN Scheduler, MPIfR, 
            Auf dem Huegel 69, D 53121, Bonn, GERMANY.
   Proposals submitted by FAX cannot be accepted. Proposals may be submitted
   by e-mail - see below.

b) EVN "Global" proposals which also request VLBA antennas, or which request
   the VLA, GB-140ft or a single VLBA antenna, must ALSO be sent to:
            The Director, NRAO, Edgemont Road,
            Charlottesville, VA 22903-2475, USA

c) Requests for THE VLBA+EFFELSBERG ALONE must be sent to both NRAO AND MPIfR.

d) Requests for any other antennas NOT affiliated with the EVN or NRAO should
   be indicated in the proposal but the PROPOSER MUST SEND A COPY to the
   Director/Scheduler of the observatory involved, and will be responsible for
   arranging all aspects of their participation, including observing support,
   tape supply and acquiring telescope time for the EVN time allocated.

e) Requests for EVN antennas outside the times of the advertised sessions must
   be sent to the individual observatories involved.

SUBMISSION BY E-MAIL
====================
Proposals may be submitted by email. They must be in Adobe post-script format,
concatenated into a single file, and sent as the main body of the email, NOT
AS A MAIL ATTACHMENT. All EVN proposals must be sent to: 
           proposevn@HP.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de
An automatic machine reply will be returned if the email has arrived.
For EVN-Global and other NRAO antennas, send also to:
           propsoc@nrao.edu

 > Do not submit by email if this is at the expense of including essential
      diagrams and other material
 > Send proposals A FEW DAYS BEFORE the deadline; only in this case can
      proposers be notified if the file fails to print !!
 > Write a 3-4 word title as the subject line for proposal identification
 > Avoid grey-scale plots, which can create very lengthy files.
 > Avoid sending proposals in duplicate
 > DO NOT send the file as a MAIL ATTACHMENT !
 > IF you specify paper size for printing, only use size A4 for "proposevn"
      (but do NOT specify A4 size for "propsoc")

WHAT TO INCLUDE
===============
All proposals should include the VLBI proposal cover sheet (see below) and a
text NOT EXCEEDING 2 SIDES. This should contain both a scientific and
a technical justification for the resources requested. It should include a 
brief summary of any related EVN proposals which have already been observed
or scheduled. Proposers should indicate if it is a resubmission of an earlier
proposal. Up to 2 additional sides with diagrams may be included; the total,
including cover sheet, should not exceed 6 sides. 

 > Proposers should identify any individual antenna(s) whose inclusion is
    considered ESSENTIAL for achieving their goals
 > Only a limited amount of time is available for observations requiring
    rapid source changes (e.g. phase-referencing) using the Lovell 
    Telescope at Jodrell Bank. A special justification must be presented.
 > Special justification is needed for requesting MERLIN or DSN antennas
 > Requests for use of the CAMBRIDGE antenna without MERLIN must have
    additional justification, and will be granted at the discretion of the
    Director, MERLIN/VLBI National Facility (UK) for highly rated proposals.

THE VLBI PROPOSAL COVERSHEET
============================
The VLBI Proposal Coversheet must be used for all proposals. The up-to-date
version should be obtained via the EVN USER GUIDE at the EVN WWW Home Page
or directly from:    http://www.nfra.nl/jive/evn/proposals/prop.html
File  covervlbi.tex  contains instructions for filling in the cover sheet.

 > Select a wavelength band (also specify frequencies for line proposals)
 > Select a recording format compatible with the requested correlator
      (select "VLBA" for VLBA-compatible MKIV modes)
 > Specify the (baseband) channel bandwidth for all line proposals
 > Select EVN antennas using the 2-character codes given in the EVN STATUS
      TABLE. (For EVN+MERLIN proposals, add "MERLIN" to the EVN antenna list)
 > Specify the GST ranges for Asian antennas separately, if appropriate

>> MAKE A CAREFUL SELECTION OF PROCESSOR (CORRELATOR). This is related to
      the chosen observing format - consult the CORRELATION section below.
      Correlator availability and capabilities may change throughout 1999.
      The EVNPC may suggest a different correlator from that requested.

CORRELATION OF EVN OBSERVATIONS
===============================
The EVN MkIV data processor at JIVE is going through a commissioning phase, 
which should lead to an operational, albeit basic, MkIV correlator by the end
of session 2, 1999. The data processor is open for a limited number of
proposals employing basic VLBA/MKIV observing modes (excluding eg MK3, pulsar
gating and oversampling). As a guideline, proposers should restrict themselves
to a total data rate of 128 MB/s, EVN only (max 8 stations) and the observing
time equivalent of 2 thick tapes per station. Spectral line capabilities are
currently limited to bandwidths of 2 MHz and wider, which can be processed
with a total of 1024 spectral points per baseline. Technical details can be
obtained from:    H.J. van Langevelde at huib@jive.nfra.nl

The MPIfR correlator in Bonn is available for EVN continuum observations 
recorded in Mk3 modes. Such proposals must be limited in size to 6 correlator
"passes". For normal (no cross-polarisation) correlation this translates to
a telescope limit of 12 for modes B,C and E, and 9 for mode A. For full
polarisation correlation, the limit is 9 for mode C and 5 for mode A.

The VLBA correlator in Socorro is available for a limited number of "EVN-only"
experiments recorded in VLBA/MK4-compatible modes. Priority for its use
will be decided by the EVN Program Committee and will be given to spectral
line proposals and those where the combination EVN + VLBA-correlator promises 
unique science. Proposers must first consult the "List of validated VLBA or
VLBA-compatible MKIV recording modes", available in the EVN User Guide under 
"Scheduling EVN Observations".

Proposers of Global projects should normally request use of the VLBA 
correlator and use VLBA/MK4-compatible modes.

SHORT OBSERVATIONS
==================
"Short" observations (< 4 hours) may be proposed up to 6 weeks before an
observing session begins, by means of a brief justification to the 
Chairman of the EVN PC, who will, at his discretion, authorise scheduling
in any gaps in the session plan. They are intended to allow the EVN to
respond to urgent "targets of opportunity", or to facilitate short, pilot
observations, if needed in preparation for a full proposal. They can only
be granted limited resources (number of telescopes, tapes, correlator time)
and must use MK3 recording modes. They should not involve any special
observing set-ups.  The present EVNPC Chairman is:  Richard Porcas, MPIfR, 
Auf dem Huegel 69, D 53121, Bonn, Germany.  FAX: +49 (0)228-525229 ;
TELEPHONE: +49 (0)228-525288 ;       E-mail: porcas@mpifr-bonn.mpg.de

ACCESS TO PROPOSAL INFORMATION
==============================
Note that the following data from the proposal will be stored in machine-
readable form:  PI name and email, wavelength, observing mode, program title,
requested telescopes, EVNPC rating. The data will be distributed to the EVN
Scheduler, VLBA scheduler and to members of the EVNPC. For proposals supported
under the TMR program "Access to Large-Scale Facilities", the title, author
list, and amount of time granted (or a brief reason for rejection) will be
made available to the EU Commission in Brussels.  Copies of all EVN+MERLIN
proposals will be made available to the MERLIN TAC Chairman, together with
the EVNPC rating. Coversheets of proposals requesting use of the VLBA
correlator will be forwarded to NRAO for checking technical feasibility.
