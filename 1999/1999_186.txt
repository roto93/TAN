Dear Colleague/Recipient,

Appended are notices regarding two post-doctoral positions at the Australia 
Telescope National Facility, CSIRO. We would be grateful if you could post 
these at your institution and forward them to anyone you think may be 
interested. Note that the closing date for the VLBI Astrometry position is 
November 1 and that for the Bolton Fellowship is December 1. We apologise 
in advance if you received more than one copy of this email.

Yours sincerely,
Dick Manchester

BOLTON POST-DOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP

Applications are invited for the Bolton Fellowship, a three-year 
post-doctoral appointment tenable at the major Australia Telescope National 
Facility locations. Bolton Fellows are encouraged to
undertake research and/or development in any area relevant to ATNF 
observational capabilities. The ATNF facilities provide unique 
opportunities to observe the Southern sky including the Magellanic
Clouds and the richest part of our Galaxy.

The ATNF, a Division of CSIRO, has its Sydney Headquarters at the 
Radiophysics Laboratory, and operates the Parkes 64m telescope, the 
Narrabri 6km Compact Array and the Mopra 22m telescope near Coonabarabran. 
The Compact Array is currently being enhanced to operate in the 12mm and 
3mm bands and to have north-south baselines. A major recent development at 
Parkes is a 13-beam focal-plane-array receiver system operating in the 20cm 
band, primarily for HI and pulsar surveys. With other Australian and 
overseas antennas, the ATNF telescopes operate as a VLBI array which uses 
the broad-band S2 recording system. The Headquarters site is shared with 
CSIRO Telecommunications and Industrial Physics (formerly CSIRO 
Radiophysics) and the Anglo-Australian Observatory, which operates the 4m 
Anglo-Australian and Schmidt optical telescopes near Coonabarabran.

The Fellowship is named in honour of John Bolton FRS, a pioneer of radio 
astronomy who made the first identifications of extragalactic radio sources 
and who worked at the CSIRO Radiophysics Laboratory between 1947 and 1981.

Applicants must have (or will shortly satisfy the requirements for) a PhD 
degree in astronomy, astrophysics or related disciplines. The commencement 
annual salary is in the range $A45K to $A48K plus benefits, with annual 
increments, typically of $A1.5K. A relocation allowance is payable. Bolton 
Fellows also receive a discretionary research allowance of $A20K over the 
three-year term.

Applications should include a curriculum vitae, list of publications, 
statement of proposed research or development ideas, and the names and 
addresses (preferably email) of three referees, and should be addressed to 
The Director, ATNF CSIRO, P.O. Box 76, Epping NSW 1710,
Australia. The closing date for applications is December 1, 1999.

For further information on the Fellowship and the ATNF, see the ATNF WWW 
pages http://www.atnf.csiro.au/, or contact Dr. R. N. Manchester, email:
rmanches@atnf.csiro.au, fax: 61-2-9372-4310, or at the above address.

POST-DOCTORAL APPOINTMENT IN VLBI ASTROMETRY

The ATNF and the US Naval Observatory are undertaking a program of 
precision Southern Hemisphere astrometry and imaging using Very Long 
Baseline Interferometry techniques for maintenance of the fundamental radio 
astronomical celestial position reference frame. The results of
this research program will be published in the open scientific literature.

As part of this program, the ATNF is offering a post-doctoral appointment 
in the field of precision VLBI astrometry and imaging, to be located at the 
ATNF headquarters in Epping. The annual salary will be in the range $A44K 
to $A50K plus benefits. Relocation expenses will be provided. The 
appointment is initially for three years, with the possibility of 
reappointment for a further two years.
Suitable applicants will most likely have a PhD in astronomy or in a 
related field, or be within 6 months of the degree being awarded. 
Demonstrated VLBI or astrometric experience, a willingness to
work in a small team and to work flexible hours are essential requirements. 
The appointee will be expected to devote substantial time to this program, 
but will also be encouraged to pursue their own
research interests, preferably in a related field, and to participate in 
ATNF activities.

Applications should be addressed to the Director, ATNF PO Box 76, Epping 
NSW 1710, Australia, and should include a curriculum vitae, list of 
publications, and details of the skills, qualifications,
achievements and research interests of the applicant, together with the 
names and addresses (email preferred) of three referees. The closing date 
for applications is November 1, 1999.

For further information on this appointment and the ATNF, see the ATNF WWW 
pages http://www.atnf.csiro.au/, or contact Dr D. Jauncey, email:
djauncey@atnf.csiro.au, fax: 61 2 6216 7222, phone: 61 2 6216 7220, or at 
the above address.

The Australia Telescope National Facility (ATNF) has its headquarters in 
Epping (Sydney) and operates radio telescopes in NSW at Parkes, Mopra (near 
Coonabarabran) and Narrabri. The ATNF also operates a VLBI network which 
uses these telescopes together with the NASA 70-m antenna at Tidbinbilla 
near Canberra, ACT, and the University of Tasmania's radio telescopes in 
Hobart, Tasmania, and Ceduna, South Australia.
