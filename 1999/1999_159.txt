            Colloquium (2:00 pm)

	    TITLE:   "Cosmological Mass Functions"
 
            ABSTRACT:
The cosmological mass function provides an analytical framework 
within which theoretical predictions for the formation of 
large scale structure of the universe can be made. 
Therefore it can in principle distinguish between different candidate
models for structure formation including the delicate issue of 
whether the primordial density fluctuation field is Gaussian or not.

Although the classical mass function theory (the Press-Schecter theory) 
has been shown to work fairly well in practice and thus used traditionally
so far, recent high resolution N-body simuations detected non-negligible 
discrepancies between the simuation results and what the Press-Schecther 
theroy predicts.

In my talk, I will show you how I have derived in my PhD thesis 
a new mass function which turns out to fit the simulation data
much better than the Press-Schecther one.
