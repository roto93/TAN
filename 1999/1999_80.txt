Announcement of IPAC's Second LWS Data Reduction Workshop


IPAC announces its Second LWS Data Reduction Workshop to be held from June
21-25, 1999.  The workshop will be an intensive 5-day course where the 
participants will reduce their own data, on individual workstations, with 
the assistance and hands-on instruction from LWS experts. Participants will 
gain a thorough understanding of the LWS instrument, data formats, and 
software tools (LIA, ISAP) that remove instrument artifacts. Additional 
science analysis tools will be covered as well. Advanced Fabry-Perot 
reduction techniques will also be part of the agenda, if requested. One 
afternoon during the week will feature LWS science presentations and 
discussion by the participants.

All interested should sign-up by 1 May 1999 by filling out the information
below and emailing it to Nancy Silbermann at: nancys@ipac.caltech.edu
