Subject: Changed web addresses for NRAO-Socorro

                                         December 9, 1999


The NRAO has overhauled the top layer of its world wide web 
page in order to streamline it and give a cleaner division
between public information and documentation needed for
scientists.  As part of that overhaul, the web pages for
individual telescopes have had their URLs changed from
www.nrao.edu to the local NRAO sites.  The overall web site
is still at http://www.nrao.edu, and the individual telescopes
can be accessed via the "Sites and Telescopes" button.

At the moment, re-directs are in place so that the links 
to individual telescopes can still be accessed directly 
by using the old www.nrao.edu URL addresses.  However, these
links will not remain in place indefinitely; when they are
removed, your links and bookmarks will quit working.  Therefore, 
all links and bookmarks to telescope web sites supported by
NRAO-Socorro should be changed.  In addition, all individual
web sites at NRAO-Socorro have been moved, so any links or
bookmarks to those pages also should be updated.  The new 
addresses are as follows:


VLBA            http://www.aoc.nrao.edu/vlba/html/VLBA.html

Space VLBI      http://www.aoc.nrao.edu/space_vlbi

VLA             http://www.aoc.nrao.edu/vla/html/VLAhome.shtml

VLA Expansion   http://www.aoc.nrao.edu/vla/html/Upgrade/Upgrade_home.shtml


An example of the new address for an individual (hypothetical) NRAO-Socorro
employee, whose name is Josephine Astronomer, is:

Josephine Astronomer  http://www.aoc.nrao.edu/~jastrono



We apologize for any inconvenience.
