Title : Associative memory of a binary neuron model

Place : R207 of Physics Building, NTHU

Abstract :=20
          Associative memory is the "Bohr atom" problem of=20
neuron network. The basic problem is to store a set of patterns=20
in such a way that when presented with a new pattern, the network=20
responds by producing whichever one of the stored patterns most=20
closely resembles the presented one. The solution of this problem=20
lies on the choice of the connection weights between neurons such=20
that the stored patterns are fixed points of the network. Based on
Euclidean geometry, a simple method is obtained for the determination=20
of connection weights.=20
