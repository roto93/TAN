1. 1999 Jan URSI/USNC meeting

The meeting was well attended with 6 Commission J sessions on: Square Kilometer
Array, Pulsars, Radio Science Education, Transmission of Troposphere, Spectrum
Management and RFI, Solar System Science. D. Backer and U. Inan gave a tag-team
plenary talk on the magnetar gamma ray flare that lit up the D region of the 
Earth's ionosphere one evening in 1998 August. We had an extended evening
session on Mon January 4: first an open forum regarding the Square
Kilometer Array, a pizza dinner interlude sponsored by Commission J, 
and then a discussion of the NAS/NRC decade review of astronomy led by 
J. Moran and K. Kellermann, An informational meeting of CORF, the Committee 
on Radio Frequencies, was held on Wed Jan 6.

   From John Conway:
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------

          URSI General Assembly - Session J2 -Call for Papers
          --------------------------------------------------

   As you may know next year is the URSI  general assembly in Toronto,
   Canada  (Aug 13  -  21 1999). Commission  J (Radio  Astronomy) is
   traditionally a major  forum for radio  astronomers to  meet.  
   In the upcoming general assembly there will be a session entitled.

       'Very High Resolution Imaging in VLBI' Session J2

   The main aim of this  session is to concentrate  on recent results  in
   both  Space-VLBI and mm-VLBI  (defined  as  frequencies of 43GHz and
   upward).
   
   Proposals for presentations at this  session are due by 
   ** 15th January 1999 **. Contributed  talks will be  approximately 
   20-25 minutes  in length, there will also  be  some longer invited
   contributions. There will also be the opportunity to present poster
   papers. The abstracts must be sent by this date directly by FAX
   or by mail to the URSI  Management  committee  in Toronto, full
   instructions can  be found at the following URL:

   http://www.nrc.ca/confserv/ursi99/call_e.htm  

   In *addition*  abstracts should be sent by email to one 
   or both of the conveners for session J2
   (John  Conway, jconway@oso.chalmers.se  and Hirax  Hirabayashi,
   hirax@vsop.isas.ac.jp), stating if the proposed paper is oral or 
   a poster. General details of the URSI  General Assembly
   meeting can be found at:

5. USNC meeting in Boulder - 2000 Jan 5-8 (no conflict with AAS!)

  Our draft sessions for URSI/USNC in Jan 2000 are:

  (a) Advances in reflector antenna design - with commission B. There are
      many antennas just being completed or being designed. These range 
      from the 100m GBT to 10-12m millimeter telescopes to 5-8m microwave
      telescopes for possible use in a square kilometer array.

      Japp Baars from Commission J would serve as co-organizer.

  (b) Novel applications of GPS - with many commissions. These include
      time/frequency metrology & synchronization; ionospheric and tropospheric
      profiling; position location including balloons & spacecraft; issues
      of antenna design and instrument limitations. The idea is to review
      the activity broadly stressing new applications, low cost hardware,
      data products/analysis availability, synergy between efforts.
  
      We will check to see if Tom Clark would serve as Comm J co-organizer.

  (c) Physical properties and dynamics of solar corona and solar wind - with
      commssions CGH. The title is descriptive of content. The coming solar
      maximum makes this topic timely.

      Steve Spangler would serve as co-organizer.

  (d) Technology for array telescopes - with D?. The radio astronomy
      community is proposing a square kilometer array to provide a two order
      of magnitude improvement over existing instruments. This is feasable
      only with cost reduction over past designs which use monolithic, 
      steel paraboloids and complex cyrogenic receivers. This session will
      focus on technological advances relevant to this effort.

      John Dreher from J and Zoya Popovic from D would co-organize.

  (e) Spectrum management - with E. This is a standing topic for us that is
      crucial to inform our members of year by year developments of spectrum
      use by miriad of competitive services. The topic can include RFI
      monitoring and excision.

      Mark McKinnon might serve as co-organizer?

  (f) Advances in cryogenic cooling systems. Radio astronomy front end
      receivers are cooled to temperatures ranging from sub-Kelvin (for 
      submm bolometers) to 70 K for low-cost microwave components. We will
      take a look at what is in use and planned and where technology is
      heading.

      Larry D'Addario will organize this session.

  (g) High sensitivity radiometer design. Measurements of micro-Kelvin 
      fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background radiation require
      unprecedented stability in ground and space based radiometer 
      design. Many experiments are just starting to map these fluctuations.
      Review of the designs and first results is planned.

      Marion Pospiezalski will organize this session.

6.   Preserving the Astronomical Sky

     An IAU-UN Special Environmental Symposium
     12-16 July 1999,  Vienna Austria

     http://proxima.astro.Virginia.EDU/~ida/iau196
     
     Issues of the harm to astronomy from light pollution, radio frequency 
     interference, and space debris; documentation of present status and trends 
     in various countries and regions; techniques for successful observations 
     in a hostile environment; regulatory strategies on international, 
     national, and local scales; alliances between astronomers and others 
     concerned about these issues (environmentalists, lighting engineers, 
     radio spectrum managers, space agencies).
