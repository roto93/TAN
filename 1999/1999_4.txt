		       The 33rd ESLAB Symposium

	  "Star formation from the small to the largescale"


	 November 1 to 5, 1999 -- Noordwijk, The Netherlands

     Preliminary announcement -- please post at your institution
				   


	This is a preliminary announcement for the 33th ESLAB
symposium, which will be held in Noordwijk, at ESTEC (the European
Space Research and Technology Centre of the European Space Agency)
from November 1 to 5, 1999.


** Rationale **

	Star formation is one of the basic processes shaping the
Universe.  Observations of both the local fossil record and direct
high-redshift systems show that stars have been forming back to very
significant fractions of the Hubble time, and testable theoretical
predictions of the properties of `the first stars' are being
developed.  Present-day star-formation is observed in galactic disks
and in the solar neighborhood with a reasonably well-parameterised
global rate, but the underlying physics connecting small and large
scales remains uncertain. The possible general importance of
`starburst' episodes in galaxy evolution, and in determining the
properties of galaxies along the Hubble sequence is intriguing.

	The basic outcomes of star formation activity, such as the
Initial Mass Function (IMF) and the energy and momentum `feedback' to
the ISM, have key influences, for example, on the chemical evolution
of galaxies and determines their colors and luminosity
evolution. Nevertheless, the physical processes regulating
star-formation, and their possible dependance on the environment, are
still far from fully understood. Basic questions such as the true
universality of the Initial Mass Function (IMF) or the mechanisms for
the dispersal of young stars are still the subject of lively debate.

	 Significant observational advances in relevant fields have
been achieved in the last few years at many wavelenghts: IR
observations (with the ISO observatory and the NICMOS camera onboard
HST), X-ray observations (with the ROSAT and ASCA observatories), UV
observations (HST), astrometric observations (Hipparcos) and
ground-based optical and (sub-)mm data all contribute, with the new
generation of large ground-based telescopes starting to play a
significant role.

	The aim of the symposium is to bring together experts on the
different aspects of star formation with experts in the fields which
are influenced by the consequences of star formation, fostering a
fruitful exchange between different disciplines, as well as between
observers in different wavelenght ranges and theoreticians.


** Logistics **

	A first announcement will be circulated early in 1999,
including a call for paper, details about registration and a list of
invited speakers. For now, book these dates! Further information will
