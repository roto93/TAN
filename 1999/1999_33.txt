            Colloquium (2:30 pm)

	    TITLE:   "Synthesis of heavy elements via rapid neutron capture. 
	              I. The supernova connection"
	    ABSTRACT: 
Approximately half of the elements with mass number A>70 and all of the
actinides (e.g., thorium and uranium) are produced through rapid neutron
capture, the r-process. After an introduction to the r-process mechanism
and evidence for its operation in nature, I discuss the observed r-process
elemental abundance patterns in very metal-poor halo stars and the meteoritic
data on the radioactive I129 and Hf182 in the early solar system. From
these observational/experimental data and our understanding of Galactic
chemical evolution, I argue that the r-process occurs in supernovae and
further, that there should be distinct supernova sources for the two groups
of r-process nuclei associated with I129 and Hf182, respectively. I present
a scenario in which the diversity of r-process production is caused by
black hole formation within about 1-10 s after the supernova explosion.
This predicts a present inventory of about 500,000,000 black holes with masses
around 1 solar mass in the Galaxy. Finally, as many radioactive r-process
nuclei emit gamma rays in decay, I discuss the implications of diverse
supernova r-process sources for future gamma-ray experiments.
