October Conference on 'Science with The Atacama Large Millimeter Array.'

Science with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) will be an
international conference on the science that will be produced by ALMA,
which might combine North and South American, European, and Asian plans
for construction of large arrays of millimeter telescopes into a single
large project. Please see the press release announcing the signing of
the Memorandum of Understanding leading to the ALMA design and
development stage at http://www.mma.nrao.edu.

The meeting will be held 1999 October 6-8 in Washington, D. C.

The purpose of the conference will be to highlight the science this
powerful world array will accomplish, with particular focus on:

 -Investigation of galaxies near the time of their formation.
 -The formation of stars.
 -Detection and study of planets and disks forming them around nearby
stars.
 -Study of the origin, distribution and evolution of the elements and
their isotopes.

It will begin with a reception and demonstration for members of Congress
in the Capitol at 5:30 pm Wednesday, 1999 October 6.  

Lectures and posters will be presented at the Carnegie Institution of
Washington, 1600 P St. NW on October 7 and 8.  Accommodations have been
arranged at the nearby Omni Shoreham Hotel for the period including the
nights of October 5 through 9. Information on reserving a room at the
special Associated Universities rate is at the WWW site.

A press conference will begin the proceedings, to explain the world
collaboration to the media. This will be held in the Board Room of the
Carnegie Institution of Washington at 8am on October 7.

The conference will be organized and hosted by Associated Universities, 
Incorporated, and the National Radio Astronomy Observatory.  

Invited speakers include Sargent, Blain, Guilloteau, Scoville, Thornley,
Genzel*, Dutrey, Boss, Mundy, Jewitt, van Dishoeck, Menten, Evans,
Fukui, Plambeck, Andre, Crutcher, Yamamoto, Olofsson, Tielens, and
Millar. (*= tentative)

Science with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array will be limited to 200
participants.  Information will be posted at
