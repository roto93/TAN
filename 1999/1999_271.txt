SECOND CROSS-STRAIT WORKSHOP ON BIOLOGY INSPIRED THEORETICAL SCIENCES

         2000 May 15-19, Zhong-Guan-Chun Science Park, Beijing

               _______________________________________

                   First Notice (1999 December 17)
               _______________________________________

Dear Colleagues:

As a follow up of the First Cross-Strait Workshop on BITS 
(XSW-BITS I) sponsored by NCTS (as part of its ongoing topical 
program on BITS) and held in June of 1998 at NCU, HAO Bailin 
and ZHENG Wei-Mo, both of ITP Beijing, are organizing XSW-BITS II, 
scheduled for 2000 May 15-19 in Beijing's Science Park at 
Zhong-Guan-Chun (Middle Pass Village).

Scientific program will include invited talks, shorter contributed
talks and poster sessions.  At the moment intended scheduled speakers
include a number of people who have visited Taiwan: HAO, ZHENG, OUYANG
Zhong-Can, LUO Liao-Fu, JI Feng-Min, TANG Chao, LI Hao (the last two
are from the States), plus most of the leading figures in the field
from China.

TK Lee and myself has been asked to organize a delegation from Taiwan.

All participants to the workshop are invited to the post-workshop
excursion: a 1- or 2-day trip to the Summer Palace in Zhengde
in Inner Mongolia (I think).

Anyone who is interested in speaking/displaying poster at or simply
attending the workshop is invited to contact me by e-mail 
by 2000 February 15.

Hope to hear from you!

HC Lee
