Dear Charles

I remember your interest at the press conference.  I also think it is a good 
idea to base your story on the actual scientific paper rather than the press 
conference (which we held as a courtesy to the AAS press organization). Our 
NRAO 12-m line detections and BIMA Array maps are quite good, but, as we tried 
to convey at the press conference and in the BAAS abstract, our identifications 
are based on calculated frequencies, which could have a large uncertainty. 
So until this issue is settled by actual laboratory measurements, it is possible 
that we are mapping some other large pair of molecules, rather than the ethers. 

Professor Kuan (Nat'l Taiwan N. U. & ASIAA), the senior author on the scientific 
paper, has been leading this effort and will go into the frequency uncertainty 
issue in much more detail. In addition, we expect that the importance of the 
laboratory frequencies for confirming Dr. Charnley's grain alcohol chemistry 
theory will accelerate the laboratory measurement efforts. As I understand it, 
diethyl ether should be straightforward to measure in the lab, but methyl ethyl 
ether is unstable. Professor Eric Herbst's group at Ohio State has already had 
one explosion while trying to measure it.

Sincerely

Lewis Snyder

Hello Professor Snyder,

My name is Charles Day. I'm an editor at Physics Today.

For the Search & Discovery department of the magazine, I'm considering 
writing about the recent BIMA discovery of two ether molecules in space. 
(I was at your press conference at the AAS meeting in Chicago.) Do you
have a paper yet on the results? I'd rather base my story---that is, if 
I write one---on an actual paper than a press release.

Regards, Charles Day
