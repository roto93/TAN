"Imaging at Radio through Submillimeter Wavelengths" will bring together 
scientists and engineers working in the rapidly developing field of
astronomical imaging at radio through submillimeter wavelengths.

Topics include:

 - Single dish heterodyne imaging
 - Bolometric imaging
 - Techniques for acquiring and processing single dish images
 - Interferometric multi-field imaging
 - Phase and amplitude calibration techniques for interferometric imaging
 - Algorithms for processing interferometric multi-field images

Invited speakers include P. Andre, L. Bronfman, R. Brown, T. Cornwell,
D. Emerson, R. Fisher, R. Guesten, D. Hartmann, T. Hasegawa, M. Heyer,
L. Higgs, P. Ho, W. Holland, R. Kawabe, C. Kramer, C. Lada, N. Neininger,

Astronomy Observatory.  The Organizing Committee is composed of
Philippe Andre, Darrel Emerson, Mark Gordon, David Hogg, Phil Jewell,
Harvey Liszt, Jeff Mangum (chair), Simon Radford, Goeran Sandell, and
Al Wootten.

"Imaging at Radio through Submillimeter Wavelengths" is currently
limited to approximately 150 participants.  The proceedings from this
conference will be published in the Astronomical Society of the
Pacific (ASP) Conference Series.

Our registration system for the symposium is now open!  See
