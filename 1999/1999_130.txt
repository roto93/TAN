Subject: FUSE satellite launched today

The Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer satellite was launched on a
Delta II rocket today at 15:44 UTC (11:44 EDT) from Cape Canaveral Air
Station, Florida.  The FUSE spacecraft released from the Delta rocket at
1:00 EDT into a 768 km circular orbit.  The spacecraft is being controlled
from the FUSE control center at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore MD. 
The solar arrays deployed at 1:06 EDT and early indications are that FUSE
is healthy. 



Notes from Florida Today Space Online:
--------------------------------------
FUSE's instrument will be turned on in about 10 days. After a
period of tests and calibrations, early observations will be
made in late August or early September. Full science operations
should begin in November and continue for three years.
