CONFERENCE SITE, ACCOMMODATION AND MEALS

Youth hostels. A list of recommended hotels of different categories,

Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania, is situated 300 km East of Baltic
seashore among forest covered hills, at the confluence of Neris and
Vilnele rivers. Vilnius was first mentioned as capital of Lithuania
in 1323, in the letters of Grand Duke Gediminas to the Roman Pope.
Many people in the world will be surprised to find out that the
Center of continental Europe lies just 26 kilometers North of Vilnius.

Vilnius is the cradle of Lithuania's political, economical and cultural
life. UNESCO included Vilnius Old Town into the world culture heritage
monument list because of its unique mixture of different architectural
styles represented in the Old Town. Vilnius' architectural diversity -
its many churches and towers, fortifications, secluded medieval
courtyards and narrow streets are testimony of the city's rich history.
There are 3 Universities and a number of other institutions of higher
education in Vilnius.

Vilnius University, the oldest University in Eastern Europe, was
established in 1579. The University library contains the richest
collection of books and manuscripts in Eastern Europe.
Full of original comfortable courtyards, arched corridors and
decorations, the University complex takes up a big space in the Old Town.

There is a number of professional theaters, several symphony and chamber
orchestras and other performing art groups. There are as well a lot of
museums in the city. Large and small festivals and happenings take place
in Vilnius all year round. Vilnius Summer Festival takes all July. You
can listen to indoor and outdoor concerts featuring famous classical
musicians, jazz stars and folk groups.

Craftsmen of Vilnius are famous from ancient times. Small gift and
souvenir shops, located all over the Old Town and city center, offer
a wide selection of goods.

The Old Town is an area where many of Vilnius' most interesting
restaurants, cafes, pubs and bars are situated. An increasing variety of
different cuisines gives one a possibility of choice. Vilnius inhabitants
have a love for exotic and unusual. As a result we have American,
Chinese, English, French, German, Hungarian, Irish, Italian, Japanese,
Mexican and other cuisines in our city. You could visit as well the local
Lithuanian restaurants, where in a unique atmosphere you can enjoy a live
folk band playing, taste the true national Lithuanian dishes, e.g.
"cepelinai" and relax drinking a glass of delicious Lithuanian beer.

Explore Vilnius for yourself and you'll enjoy making your own
discoveries.
