Tenure-Track Position
UNIVERSIDAD DE GUANAJUATO
Departamento de Astronomia
Apartado Postal 144
Guanajuato, C.P. 36000
MEXICO

Attention: Dr. Elias Brinks

The Departamento de Astronomia of the Universidad de Guanajuato,
Mexico, offers a tenure-track position. We are a young, dynamic
department which has grown rapidly and is expected to grow further in
the near future. The research interests of the Department fall in
several broad categories (star formation and evolution, stellar
astrophysics, VLBI, extragalactic astronomy, observational cosmology).
For more information see http://www.astro.ugto.mx.

We will consider appointments at both a junior as well as a more senior
level. Candidates should have completed their PhD and have at least one
year of postdoctoral experience. We will give preference to candidates
whose fields of interest match those represented in the Department. 
Applicants should be prepared to collaborate with Department members, 
and to contribute to its development. Knowledge of Spanish would be an 
advantage; a willingness to learn it is required. The Universidad de 
Guanajuato encourages especially Mexican nationals to apply.

The Department is located in a small but pleasant building and has the
necessary infrastructure of computers, internet connection, and library.
New equipment is usually obtained via research grants which we expect
the candidate to compete for. An 0.6-m telescope nearby is used for 
stellar photometry, and being modernised and upgraded. Department 
members have access to the National Observatory in Baja California,
offering a 2.1-m, a 1.5-m, and a 0.84-m telescope with optical and IR 
cameras, optical spectrographs and photometers, and to the 2.1-m telescope 
operated by INAOE near Cananea. In a few years there will be access to 
the Large Millimeter Telescope, a 50-m radio antenna developed jointly 
by INAOE (Puebla) and UMass (Amherst), and to be placed in Mexico.

Guanajuato is a charming, lively University town of about 100000
inhabitants. It is a well-known tourist attraction due to its rich
cultural heritage. Located at an altitude of about 2100 m, it has a
pleasant, sunny and dry climate.

The deadline for applications is April 30, 1999. In order to be
considered, please submit a curriculum vitae, including a summary of
past and an outline of future research, bibliography, and the names of
three references to Elias Brinks at Email: ebrinks@astro.ugto.mx, 
FAX: +52-473-20253, or phone: +52-473-29607.  For further  
information and/or questions  you may also contact the head of the 
department, Dr. Heinz Andernach (heinz@astro.ugto.mx).
