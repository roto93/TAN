LMC\,2 has the brightest most coherent filamentary structure of all 
known supergiant shells in the Large Magellanic Cloud.  The optical
emission line images show active star formation regions along the 
western edge and long filaments to the east.  {\it ROSAT \/} PSPC and 
HRI images show bright X-ray emission from within the shell boundary,
indicating the presence of hot gas.  Counter-intuitively, neither
high-resolution echelle spectra in the H$\alpha$ line nor aperture 
synthesis H\,{\sc i} 21-cm emission line observations show LMC\,2 to 
have the kinematics expected of an expanding shell.  Rather, LMC\,2 
appears to consist of hot gas confined between H\,{\sc i} sheets.  The 
interior surfaces of these sheets are ionized by the UV flux of massive 
stars in the star formation regions along the periphery of LMC\,2, while 
the heating is provided by outflows of hot gas from the star formation 
regions and by SNRs interior to LMC\,2.  
 
We have compared LMC\,2 to other supergiant shells in the LMC
and in more distant galaxies.  When the spatial resolution of our
data are degraded, we find that LMC\,2 resembles supergiant shells
observed at a distance of 4~Mpc that have previously been interpreted 
as expanding shells.  Therefore, great caution should be exercised in
the analysis and interpretation of the kinematics of distant supergiant 
shells to prevent overestimates of their velocities and total kinetic 
energies.\\

We present here dust models for the Small Magellanic Cloud bar calculated
for the first time with the regularization approach. A simple mixture
of the core--mantle and/or composite grains (mostly made from silicates
and organic refractory) together with silicon nanoparticles is consistent
with the following: 1) the observed extinction toward AzV 398 (a typical SMC
bar sightline), 2)~the~elemental abundances, and 3) the strength of
the interstellar radiation field. We predict the expected albedo and
asymmetry
parameter of the models, which can be tested in future observations.
The proposed dust models can also be tested by looking for the expected
extended red emission.

   Detections of extragalactic $^{15}$N are reported from observations of the
   rare hydrogen cyanide isotope HC$^{15}$N toward the Large Magellanic Cloud
   (LMC) and the core of the (post-) starburst galaxy NGC\,4945.
   Accounting for optical depth effects, the LMC data from the massive
   star-forming region N113 infer a $^{14}$N$/^{15}$N ratio of 111 $\pm$ 17,
   about twice the $^{12}$C$/^{13}$C value.
   For the LMC star-forming region N159HW and for the
   central region of NGC\,4945, $^{14}$N$/^{15}$N ratios are also $\approx$ 100.
   The $^{14}$N$/^{15}$N ratios are smaller than all interstellar nitrogen
   isotope ratios measured in the disk and center of the Milky Way,
   strongly supporting the idea that $^{15}$N is predominantly of `primary'
   nature, with massive stars being its dominant source.
   Although this appears to be in contradiction with standard stellar evolution
   and nucleosynthesis calculations, it supports recent findings of abundant
   $^{15}$N production due to rotationally induced mixing of
   protons into the helium-burning shells of massive stars.

We present infrared spectroscopy taken with the Infrared Space
Observatory (ISO) of the Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) R71 in the Large 
Magellanic Cloud (LMC). The spectrum shows clear evidence for the
presence of crystalline olivine at 23.5 $\mu$m. This is the first 
detection of circumstellar crystalline silicates 
outside our galaxy. In addition, we 
identify emission at 6.2, 7.7 and possibly 8.6 $\mu$m from C-rich small
grains (PAHs). The presence of C-rich grains is not expected in 
an environment where C/O is less than 1. We fit the
dust spectrum using a radiative transfer model and find a dust mass of
0.02 M$_{\odot}$. R71 was probably a Red Supergiant when it produced
the dust shell and had a time-averaged mass loss rate of the order of
$7\times10^{-4}$ M$_{\odot}$\,yr$^{-1}$ for a gas/dust ratio of 100.

We analyze the dependence of circumstellar extinction on core mass
for the brightest planetary nebulae (PNe) in the Magellanic Clouds and M31.
We show that in all three galaxies, a statistically significant correlation 
exists between the two quantities, such that high core mass objects have 
greater extinction.  We model this behavior, and show that the relation is 
a simple consequence of the greater mass loss and faster evolution times of 
high mass stars.  The relation is important because it provides a natural
explanation for the invariance of the [O~III] $\lambda 5007$ planetary
nebula luminosity function (PNLF) with population age: bright Population~I
PNe are extinguished below the cutoff of the PNLF{}.
It also explains the counter-intuitive observation that intrinsically
luminous Population~I PNe often appear fainter than PNe from older, low-mass
progenitors.

}\\

We present new high-resolution coronographic imaging and
medium-resolution spectroscopy of the circumstellar region around S61
and BE381, two Ofpe/WN9 stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud.  The
observations were carried out at the ESO/NTT (La Silla) in January
1996 and July 1998. The excellent seeing conditions allowed
the circumstellar nebulae associated with both S61
and BE381 to be spatially resolved for the first
time. The nebula surrounding S61 has the appearance of a shell with a mild
central axisymmetry.  The  surface brightness is not uniform, and the
northern region of the nebula is the brightest. The nebula exhibits a bipolar
structure with an overall morphology very similar to nebulae around
other LBVs or Opfe/WN9 stars, especially S119.
The diameter of the shell is  7.3$''$, corresponding to a linear size
of 1.8 pc. From the profile of nebular emission lines we clearly
detect an expansion motion with a velocity of 28 km s$^{-1}$, which
indicates a dynamical age of $\sim$ 30000 yrs.  We find an electron
density of 400 cm$^{-3}$ and an electron temperature of 6120 K.
The nebula is simular to other LBV nebulae in that it is nitrogen enriched.
The observed chemical and dynamical properties
confirm that the nebula is associated with  the central star and is of
stellar origin.  This result implies that S61 is likely to have
undergone a LBV-type outburst and, therefore, strengthens the suggestion
that Ofpe/WN9 stars are quiescent LBVs.
The situation is  different for BE381.  The H$\alpha$ images of  BE381
also reveal the presence of a faint nebulosity around the star; most of
the nebular flux appears to be emitted by an arc of gas located to the
east of BE381, while a much dimmer arc is detectable on the western
side. The arcs delineate a shell of 13$''$ in diameter, corresponding to
a linear size of  3.2 pc, which  appears to be expanding with a
velocity of  14 km s$^{-1}$. From the nebular emission lines
we derive an  electron density ranging between 30 cm$^{-3}$ and 120
cm$^{-3}$ (assuming T$_e$ = 10000 K), and a N$^+$/S$^+$ ratio between
1.5 and 2.3, which are  typical of HII regions.  We therefore conclude
that the shell detected around BE381 is not of stellar origin and
probably represents the relic of the interstellar bubble blown by BE381
during its O main-sequence phase.

  We present the results of a systematic search for point-like and moderately
  extended soft (0.1-2.4~keV) X-ray sources in a raster of nine pointings 
  covering a field of $8.95\ {\rm deg}^2$ and performed with the {\sl ROSAT}
  {\sl PSPC} between October~1991 and October~1993 in the direction of the 
  Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). We detect 248 objects which we include in 
  the first version of our SMC catalogue of soft X-ray sources. We 
  set up seven source classes defined by selections in the count rate, 
  hardness ratio and source extent. We find five high luminosity super-soft 
  sources (1E~0035.4-7230, 1E~0056.8-7146, RX~J0048.4-7332, RX~J0058.6-7146
  and RX~J0103-7254), one low-luminosity super-soft source RX~J0059.6-7138 
  correlating with the planetary nebula L357, 51 candidate hard X-ray binaries
  including eight bright hard X-ray binary candidates, 19 supernova remnants 
  (SNRs), 19 candidate foreground stars and 53 candidate background active 
  galactic nuclei (and quasars). We give a likely classification for 
  $\sim$60\% of the catalogued sources. The total count rate of the detected 
  point-like and moderately extended sources in our catalogue is $6.9\pm0.3$ 
  s$^{-1}$, comparable to the background subtracted total rate from the 
  integrated field of $\sim6.1\pm0.1$ s$^{-1}$.

We present the tidal tail distributions of a sample 
of candidate binary clusters located in the bar of the 
Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). One isolated cluster, SL~268, 
is presented in order to study the effect of the LMC tidal 
field. All the candidate binary clusters show tidal tails, 
confirming that the pairs are formed by physically linked
objects. The stellar mass in the tails covers a large range,
from $1.8\times 10^3$ to $3\times 10^4$~M$_\odot$. We derive a 
total mass estimate for SL~268 and SL~356. At large radii, 
the projected  density profiles of SL~268 and SL~356 fall 
off as $r^{-\gamma}$, with $\gamma= 2.27$ and $\gamma=3.44$,
respectively. Out of 4 pairs or multiple systems, 2 are 
older than the theoretical survival time of binary clusters 
(going from a few $10^6$ years to $10^8$ years). A pair shows too 
large age difference between the  components to be consistent 
with classical theoretical models of binary cluster formation 
(Fujimoto \& Kumai 1997). 

We refer to this as the 
``overmerging'' problem. A different scenario is proposed: 
the formation  proceeds in large molecular complexes giving 
birth to groups of clusters over a few $10^7$ years. In these 
groups the expected cluster encounter rate is larger, and 
tidal capture has higher probability. Cluster pairs are not 
born together through the splitting of the parent cloud,
but formed later by tidal capture. For 3 pairs, we 
tentatively identify the star cluster group (SCG) 
memberships. The SCG formation, through the recent cluster 
starburst triggered by the LMC-SMC encounter, in contrast 
with the quiescent open cluster formation in the Milky Way
can be an explanation to the paucity of binary clusters 
observed in our Galaxy.\\

We present here the analysis of the first two years of data towards the
Small Magellanic Cloud with the {\em EROS} (Exp\'erience de Recherche
d'Objets Sombres) project. A single event is detected, already present
in the first year analysis. This low event rate allows us to constrain
the halo fraction in the mass range [$10^{-2}$, $1$]$\:{\rm
M}_{\odot}$.

We  present the observations of the  binary lensing event
MACHO-98-SMC-1  conducted at the Mt.~Stromlo 74" telescope
by the Microlensing Planet Search (MPS) collaboration.
The MPS data constrain the first caustic crossing to have occurred
after 1998 June 5.55 UT and thus directly rule out one of the two
fits presented by the PLANET collaboration (model II).
This substantially reduces the uncertainty in the the relative proper
motion estimations of the lens object.

We perform joint binary microlensing fits of the MPS data together with
the publicly available data from the EROS, MACHO/GMAN and OGLE
collaborations.   We also study the binary lens fit parameters
previously published by the PLANET and MACHO/GMAN collaborations by using
them as initial values for $\chi^2$ minimization.  Fits based on
the PLANET model I appear to be in conflict with the
GMAN-CTIO data.  From our best fit, we find that the lens system has a
proper motion of $\mu = 1.3\pm 0.2$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$ with respect to the 
source, which implies that the lens system is most likely to be located in the
Small Magellanic Cloud in agreement with previous reports.
