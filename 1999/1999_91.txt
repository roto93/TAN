Subject: WIDE FIELD CAMERA 3 -Scientific Oversight Committee

Dear Colleague :
	Approximately one year ago NASA  approved the development of  the WFC3
for installation in the HST on the 2003 Servicing  Mission.The WFC3 will
be built as a facility instrument and thus will not have a PI nor a
traditional Investigation Definition Team.Instead a Scientific Oversight
Committee (SOC)  was established  to define the scientific aims and to
ensure that the broad interests of the scientific community are
represented during the development
	The primary task of the SOC,whose current membership is shown below, is
to advise the HST Project and STScI in all areas of scientific
performance of WFC3.It has met five times since July 1998.
	The WFC3, which is described in more detail in 
http://wfc3.gsfc.nasa.gov/   ,was primarily intended to be a replacement
for the WFPC2  to ensure that the HST  will continue to have superb
imaging capabilities during its lifetime (2010).
	 A number of scientific bodies, including the HST Second Decade
Committee ,the ST Institute Council,the ST Users Committee, the Time
Allocation Committee and  the NASA Origins Subcommittee  have
recommended to NASA that a near-IR channel be added to the baseline
concept.The near-IR channel will operate in the 1-1.9 micron range and
will use a 1k x 1k  Hg:Cd:Te  detector.This addition is in the final
NASA approval cycle.
	In view of this exciting new possibility  we would like to augment the
membership of the SOC to include three additional experts in IR
astronomy.
	A team of scientists and engineers from within the HST Project at GSFC
and from the STScI is responsible for the day to day activities
associated with the WFC3 project.  This team is  led by an
Instrument Scientist (Ed Cheng) and an Instrument Manager(Thai Pham),
both from GSFC, and a Deputy Project Manager (Marc Rafal) and Deputy
Project Scientist and  Operations Scientist (John MacKenty)from STScI.
	The SOC  provides broad scientific oversight and guidance to the
WFC3 project.  In particular, it is expected that the SOC will define
the key scientific objectives achievable by WFC3, within the
constraints of its main characteristics, e.g., optical configuration
and detectors.  The SOC will:

 a) define the key scientific goals for WFC3, in particular, define a
representative set of scientific  programs to be used in the development
of a Design Reference Mission.

b) define the main scientific success criteria for WFC3, and help
determine the technical trade-offs and assess performance against these
criteria.

c) recommend the set of filters to be incorporated in the WFC3 for the
optimal execution of the scientific program (broad community input will
be sought as part of the  SOC's deliberations on this issue).

d) participate in the selection of the flight and spare detectors,
including the trade-offs of the performance parameters (QE,  read noise,
cosmetics, etc.) and scientific objectives.

e) assist in the prioritization of major operational modes.

f)  participate in the major project reviews.

	It is expected that the SOC will meet an average of 4 to 5 times
each year.  Since WFC3 is to be built as a facility class instrument,
there will  be no guaranteed observing time for the  SOC members or any
other scientist. Travel and incidental expenses will be covered,  but we
ask the members of the SOC to be willing to serve on this committee
as a service to the astronomical community and as their representatives.
	We invite scientists interested in participating in the SOC to submit a
short (2-3 pages maximum) letter or email  with their personal
qualifications and a description of their expertise in the scientific
and technical areas associated with the Infrared Red  channel of the
WFC3, outlining the contributions they expect to make to the successful
completion of the project.  The letter or email  should be sent to Dr.
Duccio Macchetto at the STScI by May 7 ,1999.
	The new SOC members will be selected by a peer review panel , whose
task  will be to evaluate the qualifications and the scientific merits
of the proposed contributions .We expect those selected to be available
to participate in the next  SOC meeting scheduled for July 15 and 16 at
the STScI.


    Best regards

            Steve Beckwith         Duccio Macchetto
              Director        Associate Director for Science Programs
