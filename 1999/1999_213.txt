   The Arcetri Astrophysical Observatory (Florence) intends to 
award two post-doctoral fellowships in order to foster international
collaboration.  Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent.  In the
case of Italian citizens, it is required that they have been
affiliated with a foreign institution during the last two years.

   The fellows will take part in the observational/theoretical
research activity of the Arcetri Observatory in one of the following
areas:

1. Solar Physics
2. Physics of the Interstellar Medium and Star Formation 
3. SN Remnants and Active Galactic Nuclei
4. High Energy Astrophysics and Cosmology

   The annual activity report of the Observatory can be found in the
web page:  http://www.arcetri.astro.it/

   Applicants should have a strong previous experience in the 
relevant area.  The gross yearly salary will be between 40.000.000
and 50.000.000 Italian Lire.  The fellowships will be granted for
two years (subject to an evaluation of performance after the first
year).  The fellowships will not entail social benefits or medical
insurance, but each fellow will be requested to cover himself/
herself with basic medical insurance.  No special application forms
are required.  The applicants should send a CV, a list of 
publications and arrange for two letters of recommendation to be 
sent directly to the above address.  Applications should arrive in
Arcetri no later than January 10, 2000.  Starting date is April 
2000 but different dates can be considered.
