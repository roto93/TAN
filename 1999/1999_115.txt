the Institute for Astronomy
for the 8.2-m Subaru telescope is described.  It is an Infared Camera 
and Spectrograph (IRCS) for 1-5 microns.  One section consists of a 
high-resolution cross-dispersed spectrograph (R=20,000).  Another 
section consists of a slit-viewing camera that also serves as an infrared 
camera with two pixels scales (23 and 60 milli-arcsec per pixel).  The
infrared camera also has grisms with resolving power 400-1200.  This 
instrument is intended to be completed by the end of the year.

	    TITLE:   "New Planetary Telescope"
	    ABSTRACT:	          
The Institute for Astronomy is proposing a replacement telescope for
the 3.0 m NASA Infrared Telescope Facility.  This telescope will be
a 6.5-m off-axis telescope.  The main advantages of the off-axis
design are: (1) It will achieve very low scattered light images
without the diffraction pattern of the secondary spider; (2) It will
achieve low emissivity; (3) It will provide wide-field imaging 
(up to 2 degrees field-of-view).  Some interesting design features
of an off-axis telescope will be discussed.
