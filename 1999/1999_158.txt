1.  NASA HQ SENIOR-LEVEL VACANCIES

The NASA Headquarters Office of Space Science, Research Program 
Management (RPM) Division, Washington, DC, announces the following 
senior-level scientist vacancies:

*Senior Scientist for Astrobiology, Announcement No. HQS-SST-99-01
This senior scientist will lead the development of NASA's Astrobiology 
Program, which includes exobiology and evolutionary biology, and will 
provide scientific and technical advice on all aspects of the Agency's 
Astrobiology Program.

*Senior Scientist for Space Science Research, Announcement 
No. HQS-SST-99-02 
This senior scientist will serve as senior science advisor for

This senior scientist will oversee the development and monitoring of 
NASA's Planetary Protection Program principles and their implementation 
on space flight missions.  

All positions require education and experience equivalent to a Ph.D. 
in an appropriate space science discipline; ability to organize and 
oversee scientific research, instruments, and mission selection 
processes; and the ability to communicate orally and in writing to both
professional and non-professional audiences.  Additional qualification 
requirements are listed in the referenced vacancy announcements.

Detailed vacancy announcements, including application instructions, can 
be found under Senior Executive positions at http://www.usajobs.opm.gov

Questions of a technical nature concerning these positions may be 
directed to Dr. Guenter Riegler, Director, Research Program Management 
Division, at (202) 358-1588.

[Editor's Note:  Because of the importance of these positions to 
Astronomy and the short application period we are distributing this job
announcement to AAS members outside of the normal Job Register
procedure.  The positions will also be advertised in the September
AAS Job Register.]

2.  IMPACT OF FUNDING LESIGLATION ON NASA GRANTS 

NASA has distributed a letter to its grant holders describing 
short-term actions to be taken in anticipation of possible 
funding reductions resulting from the legislation currently 
pending in the house of representatives.  The full text of this 
letter is available on the AAS public policy web site at
http://www.aas.org/policy/nasaltr.txt

3.  PUBLIC EDUCATION AND CREATIONISM

The Washington Post has reported that the Kansas Board of Education 
may adopt a statewide curriculum that would wipe out any mention of 
evolution or the origins of the universe and may substitute references 
to creationism.  It further indicates that similar efforts are underway 
in many other states. The full Post article is available on the web at 
http://washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/WPlate/1999-08/08/157l-080899-idx.html 
More information on the Kansas standards is available on the web site of 
the Kansas Association of Biology Teachers http://www.kabt.org/ 

The AAS Council adopted a resolution on this issue in 1982.  This is 
available on http://www.aas.org/council/resolutions.html.  Since this 
is an official statement of the Society it may be freely quoted.  

AAS Member Adrian Mellot advises: "The school board is also accepting 
email or faxed comments on the standards; they should be directed to 
Penny Plamann at pplamann@ksbe.state.ks.us or 785-291-3791 (fax)."  
The Board is expected to vote on the new curriculum on Wednesday, 
11 August.

4.  NEW INSTRUMENTS AT KECK
 
Two powerful new instruments will be available on the Keck Telescopes
in the upcoming semester (2000A) beginning 1 February 2000.  NIRSPEC, 
a near-infrared, cross-dispersed echelle spectrograph, and AO, an
adaptive optics imaging system, will both be available to the user 
community.   In addition, ESI, a versatile, multi-mode spectrograph 
and imager may be available.  For detailed information about these 
instruments see http://www2.keck.hawaii.edu:3636/.

NASA is a one-sixth partner in the Keck Telescopes and makes time
available to U.S. investigators for research in support of NASA programs 
in the areas of extrasolar planets, Origins, and planetary astronomy.   
For information about application procedures and guidelines, see
http://stargate.jpl.nasa.gov:1090/.  Proposals seeking time during the
2000A semester are due September 1.
 
Because of the additional load placed on the Keck staff by the new
instruments and by work related to implementing interferometry at
Keck, visitor instruments will not be supported during the coming 
semester.

5.  STUDENT CHALLENGE AWARDS REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS

In the summer of 2000, Earthwatch Institute and The Durfee Foundation 
will sponsor research projects through the Student Challenge Awards
Program.  This program supports research through grants of $6,000 to 
$15,000 and the assistance of talented high school students.  Scientists 
supported through this program work with a single team of six to
eight students, for a period of two to three weeks.  

1 September 1999 is the deadline for summer 2000 projects.

6.  NASA'S NAME  -- APOSTROPHE VS. SLASH 

Over 500 members answered our recent call for address updates.
A few inquired why the AAS naming convention for NASA Centers 
includes an apostrophe, ie. NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center.   
We would like to clarify that the possessive naming standard was 
set by NASA, the AAS Executive Office did not set the standard.
