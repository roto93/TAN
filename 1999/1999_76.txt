We present a spectrophotometric imaging study of the emission bubble N70 
(DEM 301) in the Large Magellanic Cloud.  N70 is approximately 100 pc 
in size with a nearly circular shell-like morphology.  The nebular 
emission is powered by an uncertain combination of EUV photons, 
intense winds, and supernova shock waves from the central population 
of high-mass stars (the OB association LH 114).  We have obtained 
narrow-band images (FWHM $\sim$ 6 \AA) of N70 in the light of 
H$\alpha$$\lambda$6563, [N II]$\lambda$6584, [S 
II]$\lambda\lambda$6717,6731, and [O III]$\lambda$5007, along with the 
corresponding red and green continua.  The resulting line fluxes and 
flux ratios are used to derive ionization rates, nebular densities, 
volume filling fractions, and excitation indices.  The photoionizing 
luminosity inferred from the embedded stellar population is more than 
adequate to account for the observed hydrogen ionization rate.

We compare the emission-line photometry with that derived from similar 
imaging of the Orion nebula and with data collected from the 
literature on other emission-line regions in the LMC.  Compared to the 
Orion nebula, N70 shows much higher [S II]/H$\alpha$ intensity ratios 
which increase smoothly with radius --- from $<$0.3 near the center to 
$>$1.0 towards the outer filamentary shell.  The measured intensity 
ratios in N70 more closely match the range of excitation spanned by 
giant and supergiant H II shells and by some of the supernova remnants 
observed in the LMC.  

The contending ionization and excitation 
processes in the interior and outer shell of N70 are evaluated in 
terms of the available data.  EUV photons probably contribute most of 
the inner nebula's ionization, whereas a combination of 
photoionization plus collisional ionization and excitation of sulfur 
atoms by low-velocity shocks seems to best fit the emission-line 
luminosities and intensity ratios observed in the outer shell.  
Considerations of the radiative and mechanical energetics that are 
involved may indicate the need for one or two supernova explosions 
having occurred during the last $\sim$Myr.

The structure and dynamics of the Honeycomb nebula in the Large
Magellanic cloud are modelled as resulting from the interaction of a
supernova explosion with an existing giant shell of the type commonly
found in the LMC. In particular, the processes that may have led to
the striking morphology and velocity structure of this nebula are
examined. New data of the Honeycomb nebula, are presented. Here,
spatially resolved profiles of the \sii\ density sensitive lines,
obtained with the Manchester Echelle Spectrometer, supplement
previous, complementary, \ha\ and \nii\ profiles.

The agreements and differences between all of these data and this
simple model are highlighted.

High-resolution {\it Hubble Space Telescope} images have allowed us
for the first time to resolve the compact SMC ionized ``blob'' N\,88A
(diameter \ab\,3\frac.5 or 1 pc). This very young \h2\, region, which 
is hatching from its natal molecular cloud, is heavily affected by
absorbing dust associated with the cloud. The interstellar reddening
towards N\,88A is on average $A_{V}$\,\ab\,1.5 mag and strikingly
rises to more than 3.5 mag in a narrow dust band crossing the
core of the \h2\, region. Such a high extinction is unprecedented for
an \h2\, region in the metal-poor SMC.  We present the photometry of
some 70 stars lying towards the OB association at the center of which
lies N\,88A.  The exciting star(s) of N\,88A is not detected, due to
the heavy extinction. The chronology of star formation is discussed
for the whole region. \\

In this extension of our previous ultraviolet classification study of Small 
Magellanic Cloud (SMC) stars, we construct an ultraviolet classification 
system for stars of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), a galaxy with a 
metallicity intermediate to those of the Milky Way and the SMC.  Employing the 
same method as was used for the SMC, we compile a set of LMC spectra drawn from
the International Ultraviolet Explorer ({\it IUE}) archives, and use these 
spectra to construct a framework of reliable UV spectral classification 
criteria.  We classify 143 LMC {\it IUE} spectra, and identify the LMC standard
stars which define our UV classification system.  Representative spectra are 
presented to illustrate the patterns that the UV spectral classification 
features exhibit.  The LMC and SMC UV classification systems are intended to be
applicable to UV spectra of stars in external galaxies for which no MK standards
have been defined.  Such UV spectra are expected to be collected from 
spaceborne instruments such as the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph ({\it 
STIS}), aboard the Hubble Space Telescope.

The number ratios  $Be/(B+Be)$  of Be to B--type stars in young, well
studied clusters of the Galaxy, the LMC and SMC are examined. In order to
disentangle age and metallicity effects we choose clusters
in the same age interval and for which reliable photometric and spectroscopic
data are available. Number counts
are made for various magnitude intervals, and the results are
found to be stable with respect to this choice. In the magnitude interval
$M_{\mathrm{V}} = -5$ to -1.4 (i.e. O9 to B3) we obtained a ratio $Be/(B+Be)$ =
0.11, 0.19, 0.23, 0.39 for 21 clusters located
in the interior of the Galaxy, the exterior of the Galaxy, the
LMC and the SMC, respectively.

Various hypotheses for these differences are examined. An interesting
possibility
is that the average rotation is faster at low metallicities as a result
of star formation processes. The much higher relative N--enrichment
found by Venn (1999) in A--type supergiants of the
 SMC, compared to galactic supergiants, also strongly supports the
presence of more rotational mixing at low metallicities.
We discuss whether high rotational mixing may be
 the source of primary nitrogen in the early chemical evolution of galaxies.

A comparative analysis of Washington color-magnitude diagrams
(CMDs) for 14 star clusters and respective surrounding fields in
the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) outer disk is presented. Each
CCD frame including field and respective cluster covers an area of
$185\Box'$. The stellar population sampled is of intermediate age and
metallicity. CMD radial analysis involving star count ratios,
morphology and integrated light properties are carried out. Luminosity
functions (LFs) are also presented.
Two main results are: (i) Within the range $4<R($kpc$)<8$, the distance
from the LMC center is  well correlated with the average
age in the sense that inner
fields are younger and; (ii) Beyond $\approx$8kpc the outer fields do
not show evidence of a significant intermediate-age component in their
stellar populations, as inferred from red giant clump star counts.

We present a sample of 93 double-mode Cepheids detected in the 2.4 
square degree area in the central part of the SMC. 23 stars from the
sample  pulsate in the fundamental mode and the first overtone while 70
objects are  the first and second overtone pulsators. This is the
largest sample of such  type Cepheids detected in one environment so
far. 
 
We analyze period ratio of double-mode Cepheids and Fourier parameters
of  decomposition of the light curves of these objects. We also present
location of different type Cepheids from the SMC in the color-magnitude
diagram and show their distribution of ${V-I}$ color indices. We find
one object which  is probably a blend, either physical or optical, of
two Cepheids pulsating in  the fundamental mode.

We present a sample of 13 candidates for single-mode second overtone 
Cepheids discovered in the 2.4 square degree area of the SMC bar during
the OGLE  microlensing search. All candidates passed four photometric
tests: analysis of  Fourier parameters of the light curve, $R_{21}$ and
$\phi_{21}$, position in  the period-luminosity diagram and location in
the color-magnitude diagram. 
 
The stars form a very homogeneous group of objects with very similar
light  curves of low amplitude and almost sinusoidal shape. Their color
indices ${B-V}$ and  ${V-I}$ are also very similar and the objects
determine the observational blue edge of the instability strip of the
first overtone Cepheids. This is the first firm  sample of the
single-mode second overtone Cepheids detected so far.
