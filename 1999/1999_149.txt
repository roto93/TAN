   The IRAM Newsletter is available in electronic form:

    you may use the direct links mentioned above, or the reach it from
    the IRAM Home page (http://iram.fr/) and follow the links to the
    last issue for the Newsletter, or other new items ...

  o by means of an anonymous FTP account, opened at IRAM for In-
    ternet users, containing in a read-only public area the most recent
    issues of the IRAM Newsletter, as well as documentation on the
    IRAM telescopes and on reduction software, distribution files for
    reduction software, files for proposal preparation, ... etc. To access
    those files, please connect through ftp to iram.fr (or 193.48.252.22),
    go to directory dist/newsletter, and read the README file

  o by means of an electronic mail file server installed at IRAM (on
    iraux2). This file server is a file distribution service that uses elec-
    tronic mail facilities to deliver files. To communicate with it you
    should send a message to the electronic address:
           listserv@iram.fr
    On the first time you should send a message:
           SUBSCRIBE IRAMNEWS your name
    in order to subscribe to the mailing list IRAMNEWS. You will
    then receive an aknowledgement from the server.  Then, for in-
    stance, to obtain a copy of the January 1999 issue, just send the
    one line message:
           GET IRAMNEWS JAN99.PS
    to the above electronic address. You will receive later a mail mes-
    sage containing the IRAM Newsletter in Postscript code. Please
    discard all the e-mail header information with a text editor, and
    send the file to a Postscript printer.  More information may be
    obtained by sending the one line message:
           HELP
    Note that this file server also contains the proposal forms.

The e-mail list IRAMNEWS is used to send warning messages when the
Newsletter is available, but also to provide fast information, if needed.
   Please keep M. Guelin informed of any problem you may encounter.
