Subject: JIVE's first image


We are proud to announce that on April 7 the EVN MkIV data processor
at JIVE generated its first astronomical image. The result, an image
at 6cm of 3C380 using 8 EVN antennas recording in a MkIV compatible
mode, can be seen at:
http://www.nfra.nl/jive/jive/correlator/fimage.html.  The source shows
the same features as previous VLBI maps. In particular, we were happy
to see the jet points in the same direction!

Obtaining the first image exercised the data path at the JIVE
processor for the first time. This is an important milestone in the
commissioning phase and will lead to an operational correlator in
the next few months.

The development of the MkIV processor and MkIV recording system was a
combined effort of the EVN institutes and the MIT Haystack
Observatory. We acknowledge the help of NRAO in providing crucial test
data. Special efforts to get the JIVE data processor to this stage
were made by Sergei Pogrebenko, Chris Phillips and Harro
Verkouter. Richard Schilizzi initiated this effort to process VLBI
data end-to-end in Dwingeloo many years ago.

On behalf of the JIVE correlator project team, 

Huib Jan van Langevelde
