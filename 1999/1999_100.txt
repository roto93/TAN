Second announcement (May 1999)

The 33rd ESLAB Symposium will have as a subject "Star Formation from
the Small to the Large Scale", and will be held in Noordwijk (The
Netherlands) from November 2 to 5, 1999. 

The aim of the Symposium is to bring together researchers working on
different aspects of star formation, both local and at higher
redshifts, and both observational and theoretical.

While stars have been forming back to very significant fractions of
the Hubble time, and testable theoretical predictions of the
properties of `the first stars' are being developed, detailed studies
can only be done on present-day star-formation, as observed in
galactic disks and in the solar neighborhood. Yet, the underlying
physics connecting small and large scales remains uncertain. The
Symposium will address the basic mechanisms of star formation as well
as its basic outcomes, such as the Initial Mass Function (IMF) and the
energy and momentum `feedback' to the ISM, and their influences, for
example, on the chemical evolution of galaxies and determines their
colors and luminosity evolution.

SCIENTIFIC PROGRAM

A preliminary Scientific Program with a list of invited talks is
attached below. It will be updated with the contributed talks, and the
current version will be visible at the address
http://astro.estec.esa.nl/Symposia/Eslab33.

Topics included in the Scientific Program are

- Star formation and chemical evolution
- Early epochs of star formation
- Bursts of star formation
- Star formation in bulges, disks, halos and globular clusters
- Local star-forming regions
- Models of star formations
- The Initial Mass Function
- Observational perspectives: the IR, X-ray, HST and Hipparcos view
- Future observing facilities

In addition to the invited reviews and talks, contributed papers and
posters are solicited. The SOC will select a limited number of papers
for oral presentation on the basis of the submitted abstracts. Authors
will be notified whether their contribution is scheduled for oral or
poster presentation.


SYMPOSIUM FEE

The fee for participants registering before the Sep. 1 deadline is 250
NLG (113.45 Euro). After Sep. 1 the registration fee will increase to
300 NLG (136.13 Euro). This fee includes the use of the symposium
facilities, refreshments during the symposium, attendance to the
welcome cocktail and to the symposium dinner, transport from and to
the hotels booked through the registration service and a copy of the
proceedings.

REGISTRATION AND HOTEL INFORMATION

Registration and hotel forms can be found at
http://www.estec.esa.nl/CONFANNOUN/eslab33


FINANCIAL SUPPORT

A limited amount of financial support (in the form of partial travel
or accommodation grants) will be available for young researchers and
for researchers from less developed regions. Prospective attendees who
may require partial financial support are invited to contact the LOC
at the address eslab33@astro.estec.esa.nl well in advance of the
Aug. 1 deadline to obtain an application form.

CONTRIBUTED PAPERS AND SYMPOSIUM PROCEEDINGS

With the exceptions of these selected from the SOC for oral
presentation, contributed papers will be presented in the form of
posters. Poster papers will be accepted on all topics relevant to the
study of star formation. Posters will be displayed, for the whole
duration of the symposium, in the immediate adjacency of the
symposium hall, on panels approximately 1 by 1 meter. Ample time will
be available for poster paper sessions.

Both poster and oral contributed papers will be published in the
symposium proceedings.

For both oral and poster contributed papers abstracts have to be
submitted by the Sep. 1 deadline, using the template latex file
available at
http://astro.estec.esa.nl/Symposia/Eslab33/abstract-template.tex.
If you plan to present a paper, please indicate it in the attached
mailing-list form.

TRAVELING TO ESTEC

The symposium will take place at the European Space Research and
Technology Center (ESTEC), in Noordwijk. Most symposium participants
will be hosted in hotels in or nearby Noordwijk (transport to and from
the hotels is included in the symposium fee).

Noordwijk can conveniently be reached from Amsterdam's airport
(Schiphol), which has frequent flights to/from most destinations in
the world. Frequent train connections (approximately every 15 minutes)
are available from Schiphol to Leiden; Noordwijk can be reached from
the Leiden train station either by bus (approximately every half hour)
or by taxi.

Travelers from nearby countries may also make use of the train
service. In particular, high-speed train service is available to The
Hague from Paris as well as from Brussels and from a number of German
cities. Frequent local trains can be used between The Hague and
Leiden.
