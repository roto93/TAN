All Observers please double check your assigned times to avoid
misunderstandings. Remote Observers please notify telescope staff 
well in advance. 

Unassigned (NYA) telescope time may be requested. Allocation of
unassigned time is confirmed two to four weeks ahead of the observing
date, so pending requests may not appear on these schedules. Please see
the guidelines at http://www.tuc.nrao.edu/unassigned.html

definitive. Note your browser may display older, cached copies
rather than the most recent.

As always, if you have difficulty retrieving these schedules, I'd be
happy to send them to you by email, fax, or regular mail, as you prefer.
Please share the schedules with interested colleagues by posting them
on bulletin boards, etc.
