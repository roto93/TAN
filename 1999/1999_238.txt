1.  DOUBLING BILL (H.R. 3161) INTRODUCED IN HOUSE

On October 28, 1999, Representative Heather Wilson of 
New Mexico's first Congressional district introduced a
House version of a Senate measure (S.R. 296, passed in July)
that authorizes doubling of federal funding for civilian
research and development over the next decade.  In Wilson's 
version of the bill, authorization is given for an increase
in federal civilian R&D expenditure that will reach 2.6% 
of the total budget in 2010. Co-sponsors are currently being 
recruited and include Rush Holt (D-NJ), John Dingell (D-MI), 
Anna Eshoo (D-CA), James Maloney (D-CT), Ellen Tauscher (D-CA),
Merrill Cook (R-UT), Bob Franks (R-NJ), Zoe Lofgren (D-CA), 
and James E. Rogan (R-CA).

Members are encouraged to write letters to their 
representative encouraging them to either co-sponsor or at 
least support this bill as it moves through the legislative 
process.  If your member is already a co-sponsor, write a letter 
thanking them for their leadership.  More details will be 
available on the AAS policy web page (http://www.aas.org/policy).

Workshop 2-5pm
One-on-One Resume critiquing 5-7pm

The Workshop provides participants with valuable 
information on career choices open to astronomers today 
as well as ways to sharpen job-hunting skills.

To register, send your name to Dawn-Marie Craig 
(dcraig@aas.org) and a check for $15 to the AAS Executive Office, 
2000 Florida Ave., NW Suite 400, Washington DC 20009-1231.

See the Atlanta Meeting or Job Register webpages for more 
information (www.aas.org).

7.  REASONS TO COME EARLY AND LEAVE LATE 
    AT THE ATLANTA AAS MEETING

Save money and do a good deed [at the Atlanta AAS meeting] -

Will you be attending the next AAS meeting?  If you stay over 
Saturday night you may get a much cheaper airfare, AND do a 
good deed.  We are looking for about a dozen astronomers to 
attend the Astronomer-Teacher Workshop from 1:30 - 5:30 Saturday
afternoon.  Teachers at past workshops have been particularly 
appreciative of the chance to talk informally with astronomers 
about their research, what life is like as an astronomer, to 
get something that has always puzzled them answered, etc.  
This is also a great way to improve your communication and
outreach skills, or to find a teacher who would like to help 
put together the EPO component of a proposal.

If you can attend the workshop, please let us know at the 
AAS Education Office, aased@aas.org.

-Doug Duncan and Gina Brissenden


If you teach introductory astronomy, don't forget 
that "Astronomy 101 - A Continuing Dialogue" is held the first
afternoon of every AAS Meeting.  The discussion topics
this time will be:  Education Research and Assessment as Applied
to Teaching Astronomy,  Evolution - How Do We Deal With It?, and
Using Planetariums and the Real Sky in Teaching.

_________________________________________________________
8.  NASA SENIOR POSITIONS

NASA has reopened the recruitment for two important senior 
positions in the Research Program Management Division of 
the Office of Space Science at NASA headquarters.  These 
positions, which originally appeared in the September 1999 
AAS Job Register 

http://www.aas.org/JobRegister/september/no10723.html

are: SENIOR SCIENTIST FOR PLANETARY PROTECTION, and 
SENIOR SCIENTIST FOR ASTROBIOLOGY.  The ads will be 
re-posted in the December Job Register with an application 
deadline of 15 December 1999. 

_________________________________________________________
9.  AAS IS READY FOR Y2K

The AAS Executive Office has been getting ready for Y2K and 
we believe that all of our systems are ready to handle the 
new year.  In an effort to ensure that our members are also 
ready to welcome 2000, we would like to recommend some of the 
following upgrades and enhancements to your personal systems.

Web Browsers include enhancements enabling users to browse 
effectively and avoid security risks.  Upgrading to  Netscape 
Communicator 4.6 or higher or Internet Explorer 5.0 or higher 
will ensure maximum browsing capabilities.

Ghostview - Postscript Reader 2.7 or higher in addition to 
Ghostview are helpful tools to read and print Postscript and 
Encapsulated Postscript files.

Adobe Acrobat Reader - 3.0 or higher is used to view and 
print PDF formatted files.  These filetypes allow the 
publication to be printed and viewed the way the author 
intended it to look.

In addition to the above tools, please make sure your 
institution has evaluated your individual workstation 
for application software and operating system compatibility 
with Y2K.

If you have any questions, please direct them to 
Debbie Kovalsky, Manager Information Systems at the AAS -
kovalsky@aas.org.

10.  CALL FOR PROPOSALS WITH THE OVRO MILLIMETER-WAVE ARRAY
 
The deadline for proposals for observations with the 
Owens Valley Radio Observatory millimeter-wave array in 
the period February 2000 through May 2000 is 
Monday, 10 January 2000, 5PM PST.
 
Proposals from investigators who are not at Caltech are 
strongly encouraged!  In the past, external proposals 
have typically received about half of the assigned time 
in an observing season. All proposals are evaluated on a 
competitive basis independent of whether they involve 
internal collaborators.
 
Instructions for submitting proposals and technical 
information about the array can be found at the OVRO 
web site at

http://www.ovro.caltech.edu/mm/main.html
 
Questions concerning the interferometer or proposal submission 
should be directed to one of the OVRO postdocs listed at the 
above web site, or by contacting Anneila Sargent at 
afs@astro.caltech.edu (phone: 626-395-6622).

11.  SOFIA's DELAY IN THE SECOND CALL FOR PROPOSALS

To conform to NASA's re-baselined schedule for SOFIA,
USRA is postponing the second call for instruments
by 12 months.  The expected call for second generation 
instrumentation is now March 2001.

In anticipation for the call, SOFIA will host several 
workshops at the June 2000 AAS meeting in Rochester.  
These session will cover airworthiness instrument 
certification, general investigator proposals and 
observations, and a topical SOFIA science session based 
upon funded first light instrumentation.

Please direct questions regarding SOFIA instrumentation 
to Sean Casey at scasey@mail.arc.nasa.gov.  Further 
information on SOFIA can be found at http://sofia.arc.nasa.gov
