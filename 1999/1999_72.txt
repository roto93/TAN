     ISO beyond point sources: studies of extended infrared emission
     ===============================================================

                        14-17 September 1999
                          ISO Data Centre
                      Villafranca del Castillo
                           Madrid, Spain


This is the first announcement for a workshop which will be held at the Data
Centre of the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) in Villafranca del Castillo near
Madrid (Spain) from September 14 to 17, 1999.

ISO observations spatially resolved a variety of objects ranging from planets,
circumstellar envelopes, and galaxies, to larger structures like comet trails,
interstellar clouds, and star forming regions. It is also possible to investi-
gate the properties of the zodiacal, galactic, and extra-galactic backgrounds
since ISO measured the absolute brightness level of the infrared sky.

The analysis of extended sources presents new challenges compared to the 
analysis of point sources. In most cases, expertise is required in surface
brightness calibration, map construction, and source flux extraction to
arrive at reliable results and interpretation. Comparison of results with
data from other experiments is often highly desirable. General knowledge of
the infrared backgrounds can be used to separate more accurately the extended
emission of a spatially resolved source from its background.

This workshop aims at bringing together scientists, who are working on
programmes in which extended emission is important, to exchange results
and experiences. Instrumental issues such as imaging, beam profile
characterisation, defringing, etc. will be discussed so that expertise
can be shared. Spectroscopy on extended sources is included.

The workshop agenda will be arranged mainly according to scientific topics
because it is generally not easy to understand the observations without a
clear knowledge of the underlying scientific problem. We invite participants
to give presentations concentrating on the scientific case of their project.
A number of presentations will be given by the instrument experts. Some time
will be dedicated to review methods and techniques from (far-)infrared expe-
riments other than ISO.

If you are interested in participating the workshop please fill in the form
attached to this email and return it to

helpdesk@iso.vilspa.esa.es             before  19 April 1998
------------------------------------------------------------

We will send out a second announcement by the beginning of May 1999 which
includes detailed information on logistics, a tentative workshop agenda, and a
list of invited speakers. The workshop proceedings will be published probably
in the ESA-SP series.

===============================================================================

If you are interested in the workshop, please return the following
questionnaire to helpdesk@iso.vilspa.esa.es before 19 April 1999.
We will keep you on the mailing list.

1)  Name:                          
    Affiliation:
    Mailing address:
 
2)  Are you interested in participating in the Workshop?

3)  Are you willing to give a presentation of your work during the 
    workshop? Can you give a title?
    
4)  It has been suggested that it would be desirable to have a separate
    data reduction workshop on extended sources for at most 15 people.
    During this Hands-On Workshop people can reduce ISO data guided by
    instrument specialists.
    
    Would you be interested in such a dedicated Hands-On Workshop
    a few days prior to the science workshop?

    If yes, please give brief description of your programme and requested
    instrument expertise.
