Looks like the Cambridge proposal for an SZ telescope did not get funded.

hi everyone, here's the press release for
VISTA (a 4 m telescope) and a gravity wave detector that
are being funded, obtained via martin.  sending it along
this way as we won't be having the thursday rumor sessions 
at journal club for a while.

Government/Private Sector Funded Projects to Probe Origin
of the Universe

Our understanding of the universe and mankind's genesis is
about to be enlightened by two British University research
group projects funded by the DTI, the Wellcome Trust, and
the Higher Education Funding Council for England's "Joint
Infrastructure Fund" (JIF) initiative.

A world-leading "survey" telescope capable of mapping huge
areas of the sky to great depth will be built as a national
facility by an 18 strong university consortium led by Dr Jim
Emerson of Queen Mary and Westfield College, University of
London.

The 4 metre telescope, known as VISTA (Visible and Infrared
Survey Telescope for Astronomy) will produce "atlases" of
the sky in the optical and infrared wavelength using
instruments a hundred times more sensitive than anything
available in the world.  Sited high in the Chilean Andes, the
VISTA telescope's sky atlases will provide the most
advanced source of reference from which in-depth studies of
specific astronomical objects can be made.
 
Dr Emerson commented, "VISTA will be an outstandingly
powerful tool for British astronomy.  The whole astronomical
community is delighted with this decision".  Dr Emerson
added, "Many of the questions that astronomers world-wide
are trying to answer, like how did stars and galaxies form,
cannot be tackled by optical surveys since stars are born in
clouds of gas and dust which are largely opaque to optical
light, but not to infrared.  This is where VISTA will conduct
ground-breaking surveys and literally shed new light on those
key 'origin questions' ".

A second team of scientists from Glasgow University, led by
Professor Jim Hough, is poised to identify a whole plethora of
astronomical phenomena using an advanced breed of highly
sensitive gravitational wave detector to be developed at the
university's new, JIF funded, facility.

Einstein predicted that gravitational waves would signal the
existence of obscure stellar objects hidden deep in the outer
reaches of space and time. Professor Hough explains,
"Exotic bodies such as interacting black holes, coalescing
compact binary systems, stellar collapses and pulsars will
all be identified using our new detectors.  This will make a
quantum leap forward in our understanding of the Universe.".

Both projects come under the Government's Particle Physics
and Astronomy Research Council's (PPARC) remit, whose
Chief Executive, Professor Ian Halliday said, "The scale of
this investment is tremendously encouraging and represents
a real increase in funding for the basic physical sciences.  In 
particular, HEFCE (the Higher Education Funding Council for
England) are to be highly praised for  the additional funding
they have made available to this important scheme."

Professor Halliday went on to say, " Given the pressure on
funding I am delighted that 6 outstanding proposals from the
PPARC community have been deferred into round two of the
awards.  This clearly endorses the world-beating research
projects our scientists are working on."

The Joint Infrastructure Fund (JIF), a partnership initiative
between the DTI, the Wellcome Trust and the Higher
Education Funding Council for England, is designed to
enable UK universities to invest in new facilities and
equipment which underpin basic research projects to ensure
British Universities remain at the forefront of international
scientific research.

BACKGROUND NOTES FOR EDITORS

1	The VISTA and Gravitational Wave detector university
led projects represent two from a total of 18 awards made to
universities in the first round of funding from the Joint
Infrastructure Fund (JIF).

2	The first round of awards total 150 million.

3	The JIF initiative was established in July 1998 by a
partnership between the DTI and the Wellcome Trust each
committing 300 million.  This was later augmented by an
additional 100 million from the Higher Education Funding
Council for England bringing the total JIF fund to 700 million.

4	The JIF fund covers the whole spectrum of science and
engineering in the UK University sector and is available for
facilities and infrastructure which underpin basic scientific
research projects.

5	The Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council
(PPARC) received 25 applications from its science
community.

6	Six of PPARC's funding applications have been
deferred to Round 2 of the JIF awards.

7	PPARC will accept applications for consideration in
Round 2 until 31 May for decision in November 1999.

9	GRAVITATIONAL WAVE DETECTORS

	The Glasgow University occupies a world-leading
position in gravitational wave technology and has pioneered
the development of novel and highly sensitive techniques
necessary for building the current range of detectors.

10	The University is currently involved in several
international projects:

	i)	Glasgow is providing a baseline suspension
design for the first upgrade of the American LIGO detectors.

	ii)	In conjunction with the Max Planck Institute in
Garching, Germany, Glasgow University has pioneered
research into interferometry, a key technology in gravitational
wave detectors.

	iii)	Funded by PPARC, Glasgow University is
currently deeply involved in the construction of the GEO 600
gravitational wave detector in Hanover, which will commence
data acquisition in 2000.


The Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council
(PPARC) funds research, education and public
understanding in its four broad areas of science - particle
physics, astronomy, cosmology and space science. 

PPARC is government funded and provides researchers from
British universities with access to world-class facilities and
funds the UK membership of international bodies such as the
European Laboratory for Particle Physics, CERN, and the
European Space Agency. It also contributes money for the
UK telescopes overseas on La Palma, Hawaii, Australia and
in Chile and the UK Astronomy Technology Centre at the
Royal Observatory, Edinburgh.
									
PPARC's Public Understanding of Science and Technology
Awards Scheme provides funding to both small local projects
and national initiatives aimed at improving public
understanding of its areas of science.
