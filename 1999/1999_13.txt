AAS DECADAL ISSUES DISCUSSION FORUM NOW AVAILABLE

In cooperation with the NRC "Astronomy and Astrophysics Survey Committee",
the AAS has developed a web-based forum for discussion of issues pertaining
to the Decadal Review.  The forum is moderated by Dr. Lee Anne Willson, and
all contributions will be archived at the AAS.  AASC panel chairs have been
invited to provide questions for the community to consider, and summaries
of discussion will be sent to them as well as posted at appropriate
intervals.

Members are encouraged to familiarize themselves with the site
(http://www.aas.org/decadal) and to contribute to the discussion.  At the
open forum held at the AAS meeting, AASC chairs Joe Taylor and Chris McKee
stressed that their report will be put together over the next few months,
so the sooner your input is received the more influential it will be.
