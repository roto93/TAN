        The aim of this conference is to summarize our present 
        knowledge on star formation and foresee future directions.
        This conference will cover all the topics related to star 
        formation, e.g., molecular clouds and cores, protostars
        and their associated disks, jets and other activities from
        YSOs, binary and cluster formation, and star formation in nearby
        and young galaxies. The conference consists of invited talks 
        by the researchers in the forefront of the study of star 
        formation. We also prepare a large hall for poster presentations.

VI. Call for Contributed Papers

        All the participants except for invited speakers are encouraged
        to submit a poster paper. Poster space available is 90cm (width)
        x 120 cm (height) for each participant. We assume that the first

        Authors of poster and oral presentations are asked to observe
        deadlines and instructions. Deadline of the abstract is May 20,
        1999 and that of the proceedings is July 31, 1999.
  

VII. Financial Support

        We have a limited amount of travel support for participants
        and are still applying for another grant. Those who need
        the support should 
           1.  register yourself through WWW or by E-mail,
           2.  send abstract before the deadline to
                    sf99submit@rccp.tsukuba.ac.jp
           3.  and send the financial support application form
                    by e-mail to
                    sf99@tap.scphys.kyoto-u.ac.jp
        Note that the deadlines for registration and abstract
        are earlier for those who apply to financial support.
        For participants from overseas who apply for the
        support, the deadline is February 15, 1999. Otherwise, the
        deadline is March 31, 1999. We select applications taking
        account of the age and poster paper abstract. Preference
        is given to younger participants who have rare chances to
        obtain financial support. The result will be informed to each 
        applicant by the end of April to those from overseas and 
        by the end of May to those from Japan.

VIII. Accommodation 

        We have booked single and twin rooms for participants at 
        Daiichi Hotel Nishiki. The room charge is 8,835 Yen and 
        14,726 Yen per night per room for single and twin rooms, 
        respectively. This includes service charge and tax but 
        not any meal. This rate is reduced 15% from the normal price 
        listed on WWW. 

        You can request the rooms 1) at our WWW home page, 2) by E-mail.
        You can choose only two out of the two ways. 
        However, we strongly recommend the registration through the WWW
        page because your form will be processed automatically by our
        computer. Please input your full name, gender, affiliation,
        E-mail address, number of single/double room(s), arrival (the
        first night), departure (the last morning), expected arrival time.
        If you order twin room or more than 1 single room, specify all
