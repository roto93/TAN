Dear Colleagues,

I sent out an email about the financial support for participants 
(mainly students and postdocs) of "star formation 1999", held in June
in Japan (see below details). Unfortunately, I have received only
a few responses to my email so far. I am going to make a list of possible
candidates who want to attened the meeting under the financial
support, and to send it to the LOC of the meeting.
Postdocs and students who intend to attend the meeting are highly
recommended to apply for the financial support. People from Asian
countries have more chances to get the support.

If you are interested in the support to attend the meeting,
let me know the followings by 1/31/1999:

1. Name
2. Institute
3. Position
4. Your poster title with a short abstract
5. Supervisor's name (if you have)

Looking forward to hearing from you soon,

Nagayoshi

Dear Colleagues,

As you may know, a meeting "Star Formation 1999" will be held in Japan
(June 21-25, 1999; see below for more details). This is a meeting 
for Prof. T. Nakano, who is going to retire from the Nobeyama Radio 
Observatory, Japan next March. Several famous astronomers are being 
invited to the meeting, too. The second circular is going to be distributed 
at the middle of the next January.

Actually, the LOC of this meeting is planning to get a budget for
financial supports to attendees (mainly students and postdocs from Asia),
and is surveying how many people are interested in this financial support.
The attendees, who get the support, are expected to present posters at the
meeting.

I was asked to survey for young astronomers in Taiwan, who are interested in
this financial support.

If you are interested in this support as well as presenting a poster 
at the meeting, please let me know the followings by 1/31/1999:

1. Name
2. Institute
3. Position
4. Your poster title with a short abstract
5. Supervisor's name (if you have)

I am looking forward to hearing from you.

Cheers,

Nagayoshi Ohashi
