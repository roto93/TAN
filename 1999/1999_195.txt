BIMA: Call for Proposals

Wednesday, November 10, 1999 (11:59 pm CST) is the deadline 
for BIMA proposals requesting use of the 10-element interferometer 
in A, B, C, and D arrays at 3 mm and 1 mm during Winter and Spring 
of the year 2000.

For complete details see:
  http://www.astro.uiuc.edu/~bima/call_for_proposals.html
  http://www.astro.uiuc.edu/~bima/proposal/WhatsNew.html
  http://www.astro.uiuc.edu/~bima/proposal/instructions.html

FINAL WARNING 

For the last set of proposals, 60% would not process correctly 
as originally submitted.  We have neither the time nor the personnel 
to deal with these errors. For your convenience, a list of some errors
people have made has been added to the Instructions for BIMA Observing
Proposals. Any proposal containing one of these errors is subject
to being summarily dropped from consideration. If we can't process it, 
we can't send it to the referees, and you won't get observing time! 
It is as simple as that. Do not assume that your previous proposals 
were error free; we have been silently fixing many of the errors. 
No longer!
