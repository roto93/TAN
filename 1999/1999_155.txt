School of Mathematics and Physics
Associate Lecturer/Lecturer(Level A/B)
 in Physics/Radio Astronomy

Applications are invited for the position of Associate Lecturer/Lecturer in
Physics within the School of Mathematics and Physics.  The appointee will
be expected to contribute to the teaching of Physics at a range of academic
levels and be active in research in radio astronomy.

The Discipline of Physics within the School of Mathematics and Physics has
6 full time academic staff and 3.4 technical/support staff.   It offers a
range of courses in Physics leading to a major in the discipline as well as
offering Honours, MSc and PhD programs.  Radio astronomy is one of the
major research areas in physics.  The School operates two radio astronomy
observatories, at Mt Pleasant near Hobart and at Ceduna in South Australia.
 There are 26 metre and 14 metre  antennas at Mt Pleasant and a 30 metre
antenna at Ceduna.  Both observatories are instrumented for operation at
frequencies up to 22 GHz.  They are used regularly as part of an Australian
and international antenna arrays for very long baseline interferometry
(VLBI).  They are equipped with hydrogen maser frequency standards,
multichannel autocorrelators and wideband  VLBI recorders.  The radio
astronomy research group currently has 3 postdoctoral fellows and 2
additional support staff.

The successful candidate would be expected to be able to work independently
and also as part of a team, and have the aptitude and willingness to
initiate and submit effective and competitive applications for external
