                        FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT


  "Where is Population III?"  (H.E. Bond, 1981)

              "And if population III were population II?" (R. Cayrel, 1986)



  Dear Colleague,
 
  These two quotations (titles of papers in the field) very concisely
summarize our knowledge about "The First Stars". But progress is being
made, and hope is not to be lost!

  It is for this reason that the European Southern Observatory and 
the Max-Planck Institute for Astrophysics are organizing a 3-day
workshop on ``The First Stars'', to be held in Garching,
Wednesday-Friday August 4-6, 1999.

  The aim of the workshop is to summarize the state of knowledge
about the metal-free (or Pop.III) stars, their existence, formation,
evolution, and their relation to primordial structure formation and
early galaxy evolution.

  The organizers would be happy to bring together in this meeting,
experts from all fields connected with the earliest generation of
stars, to make it a lively place to exchange and combine their ideas
and results.


                                 The SOC/LOC of "The First Stars".

PS: only 5 days after the meeting the total solar eclipse will be 
    visible from Garching (see below)

PPS: please communicate this mail to other colleagues who might
     be interested in this subject



Topics covered:

-Searches for Pop. III stars. Characteristics of stars known
-Observed abundance patterns in ultra metal-poor stars
-Theoretical abundance predictions for very metal-poor stars
-Stellar evolution at zero, and very low metallicities
-First structure formation
-Star formation at very low metallicities
-Abundance patterns in QSO-absorption lines
-Dwarf galaxies as possible first galaxies
-Galaxy formation

Review speakers: T. Beers, V. Castellani, C. Chiosi, M. Mateo,
K. Nomoto, M. Norman, F. Palla(*), M. Pettini(*), S. Ryan,
F. Spite, S.D.M. White
(*=to be confirmed)

We plan 7 invited reviews of 40+5 minutes, 4 invited reviews of 30+5
minutes, 10 targeted talks of 25+5 minutes, 15 contributed talks of
15+5 minutes, 2 dedicated poster sessions and a final panel discussion.

Targeted and contributed talks will be selected by the SOC from among
the talks proposed.

Proceedings will be published.

Venue & Accommodation:
#####################

The conference will be held at ESO (the Auditorium for the talks) and
MPA (Poster Session), which are located about 15 minutes walking
distance outside of Garching, which is located 15 km north of Munich.

Accommodation will be in hotels in Garching. At this moment we have
made pre-reservations for 70 persons. Your early registration would be
helpful to finetune this number. Prices hardly differ between hotels
and range from DM 120-125 for single occupancy, to DM 160-180 for
double occupancy (per night).



Registration:
#############

The registration fee is set to 150.- DM (approx. 90 $), if you register 
before 31st March 1999, and will be 200,- DM (approx. 120 $) afterwards. 
Registration closes on 31st May 1999. The registration fee will cover:
A copy of the proceedings, coffee/tea/cookies during the breaks, a welcome 
reception, and transport from Garching to ESO in the morning and after
the last session of the day.

You can register by filling out the appropriate form on our
homepage:   http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/~stars/
or by returning the form below.

You may pay using the following means (NO credit cards can be accepted):

-bank-to-bank transfer, to:

     Deutsche Bank Muenchen
     Account: 193-1120
     Bank code: 700 700 10

     please mark: ``1999 ESO/MPA conference'', and make sure that the
     transfer costs are for your account.

-Cash upon arrival


Limited financial support may be available to a few individuals, and
you can indicate this when registering.



The SOLAR ECLIPSE on August 11th:
#################################

As you may know, on August 11, 1999 there will be a solar eclipse
visible in parts of Europe. As it so happens, the eclipse is total and
almost of maximum duration in Garching (2min 19sec). Probability for
clear sky is about 50%.  We imagine that some of you want to take
this opportunity to stay a few more days, and on the registration form
you can indicate this. At this moment, an extended stay is possible
only in one of the three hotels we have made pre-reservation (single
room: DM 120, doubles: DM 180 per night)
