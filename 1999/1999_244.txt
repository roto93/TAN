  2- CONTRIBUTED PAPERS
  =====================

      Participants are invited to present poster papers. The SOC will select
      some of these for contributed oral presentations (30 minutes duration
      including discussion). Ample space will be available for poster 
      presentations. Posters will receive special attention by
      reserved space in the plenary programme for poster sessions.

      Proceedings will be published after the conference at a well-established
      publisher. It is our aim to provide two pages space in the
      proceedings for every poster. While we want to select and highlight
      invited short and review talks, it is our policy to be as open as
      conference organisation allows in the acceptance policy of participants
      and contributions.

      The abstracts of all posters, contributed and invited talks will
      be published in the Astron. Ges. Abstract Series. Please use the
      special LaTeX-Template Macro for that purpose which can be downloaded
      from http://www.ari.uni-heidelberg.de/star2000/agabstract.tex .
      The deadline for abstract submission is January 20, 2000, in order
      to have the abstract booklet ready at the time the conference starts.


      THE DEADLINES FOR RECEIVING ABSTRACTS
         - TO BE CONSIDERED FOR ORAL PRESENTATION:   DECEMBER 17, 1999.
         - TO BE INCLUDED IN THE ABSTRACT BOOK:      JANUARY  20, 2000

      After Dec 17, 1999, a compile and review procedure by the SOC will
      begin and result in a preliminary programme including ALL talks 
      before the January 20, 2000, deadline. We will make every effort
      that all applicants will know before January 20, 2000, whether their
      contribution is accepted for oral presentation or not.

Electronic publishing (EP) is considered nowadays as a hot
subject. A whole colloquium would be necessary to discuss the
various aspects and to review the situation on the EP front.
In the limited framework of this paper, a few broad ideas will
be brought up and basic concepts introduced in order to put EP
in context. References and access keys for further
documentation/readings are given in the bibliography.

There will not be much about astronomy itself. However it is
obvious that the matter at hand will have an enormous impact
on our life and on the way we do science. The field is in
permanent evolution. Things that were looking as `wacky' a
couple of years ago are now part of the common landscape.
Advances in various fields (telecommunications, technologies,
methodologies, concepts, sociology, and so on) have to be
closely followed and one has to be prepared for whatever is
coming up.

Some astronomy publishers have already made a few steps in the
direction of EP, but still a lot has to be done if we wish to
speak of proper/real EP and not only of merely
computer-assisted traditional publishing or of traditional
publishing with an electronic mirror.

Not so long ago, we were still using mechanical typewriters,
talking over noisy telephone lines (sometimes hard to get!)
and relying on postal services in order to work and publish.
It might seem we have always lived with electronic mail.
The omnipresent World-Wide Web (WWW) is only about four years
old. Four years!
