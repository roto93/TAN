Dear Colleagues,

We at ASIAA is happy to see that Jeremy Lim has been invited by NSC to give an 
invited talk at OCPA on 3/18.  He will demonstrate to all scientists of Chinese 
origin in the world that Taiwan astrophysics is on a rapidly rising track.

           Recent Advances and Cross-Century Outlooks in Physics: 
                Interplay between Theory and Experiment  
               ----------------------------------------

                        March 18-20, March 1999
              Ramada Inn (Downtown), Atlanta, Georgia, U.S.A.

			    Sponsored by

		Overseas Chinese Physics Association
                              and 
	         National Science Council of Taiwan          


I. INTRODUCTION

The Centennial celebration of the American Physical Society at Atlanta
in March 20-26, 1999 is a special APS meeting in which all subfields
of physics are represented.  It will allow ethnic Chinese physicists
from different subfields, geographical areas, and continents to meet
and to discuss problems of common interest.

We would like to join in this Centennial celebration with an overview
of recent advances and a cross-century outlooks into the next
century. This will be the First OCPA Conference in the United States.
