Dear Yi-Jehng,

You left out Chou Wen Chien, who is joining us from Japan in September.
His expertise is in MHD and he will be working with Prof. Frank Shu
when he arrives at the ASIAA.  A Taida graduate, he received his PhD from
UTexas at Austin and has been a postdoc in Japan.

Sienny Shang (Shang Hsien), who will be working with Typhoon and Chi,
along with Frank Shu and Paul Ho, to design and carry out SMA observations
of protostellar outflows and the Kuiper Belt.  Also a Taida
graduate, Sienny started out in Biophysics at UC Berkeley but ended up
receiving a PhD in Astronomy from Berkeley last year.

Cheers,
KYL

Professor K. Y. Lo
Director 
Institute of Astronomy & Astrophysics
Academia Sinica
