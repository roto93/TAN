        EVN JOINT OBSERVATIONS WITH OTHER ANTENNAS AND ARRAYS

Proposers may request EVN antennas together with other telescopes and arrays.
Combined EVN+MERLIN projects add the short MERLIN array baselines, as well as
providing VLBI baselines to the CAMBRIDGE antenna. Antennas of the NASA DSN, 
and ARECIBO (when equipped) may be available for a small number of projects
requiring very high sensitivity. GLOBAL projects add the NRAO VLBA and/or
other US antennas, creating an array of up to 20 elements, suitable for very 
high dynamic range imaging, and "snap-shot" observations of many sources. 
==============================================================================

                    SUBMITTING  EVN  PROPOSALS
                    ==========================

WHEN TO SUBMIT - AND AFTERWARDS
===============================
Proposals must be received by 1st Feb, June or Oct. A list of Project Codes
and Principle Investigators for all proposals received will be posted on the
EVN WWW Home Page under "EVN Program Committee" shortly after the deadline.
All communication between the Proposer(s), and the EVN Program Committee
or Scheduler will be via the Contact Author designated in the proposal. The
results from proposal review will be communicated after the next meeting of
the EVN Program Committee, and will be SENT BY EMAIL unless otherwise 
requested in the proposal Abstract.

WHERE TO SUBMIT
===============
a) An EVN proposal is any request for 2 or more EVN antennas for observations 
   to be scheduled during an EVN observing session. All EVN proposals (except 
   those for VSOP), including EVN+MERLIN, EVN+ARECIBO, EVN+VLBA, etc, must
   be sent to:      Dr. R. Schwartz, EVN Scheduler, MPIfR, 
                    Auf dem Huegel 69, D 53121, Bonn, GERMANY.
   Proposals submitted by FAX cannot be accepted.  
   Proposals may be submitted by e-mail (see below).
         EVN proposals which request MERLIN, ARECIBO, DSN, or VLBA CORRELATOR 
   need not be submitted elsewhere. See below for other telescopes. 

b) EVN "Global" proposals which also request VLBA antennas, or proposals which
   request the VLA or a single VLBA antenna, must ALSO be sent to:
                    The Director, NRAO, Edgemont Road,
                    Charlottesville, VA 22903-2475, USA

c) ALL proposals requesting use of the Space VLBI mission VSOP (including those
   which request the EVN as a co-observing ground array) need only be sent to
   ISAS in Japan. Information on VSOP proposal submission can be found at: 
           http://www.vsop.isas.ac.jp/obs/AO.html

d) Requests for THE VLBA+EFFELSBERG ALONE must be sent to both NRAO AND MPIfR.

e) Requests for any other antennas NOT affiliated with the EVN or NRAO should
   be indicated in the proposal but the PROPOSER MUST SEND A COPY to the
   Director/Scheduler of the observatory involved, and will be responsible for
   arranging all aspects of their participation, including observing support,
   tape supply and acquiring telescope time for the EVN time allocated.

f) Requests for EVN antennas outside the times of the advertised sessions must
   be sent to the individual observatories involved.

SUBMISSION BY E-MAIL
====================
Proposals may be submitted by email. They must be in Adobe post-script format,
concatenated into a single file, and sent as the main body of the email, NOT
AS A MAIL ATTACHMENT. EVN proposals (except those for VSOP) must be sent to:
           proposevn@HP.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de
An automatic machine reply will be returned if the email has arrived.
For EVN-Global and other NRAO antennas, send also to:
           propsoc@nrao.edu
For VSOP proposals, consult the WWW page given above.

 > Do not submit by email if this is at the expense of including essential
      diagrams and other material
 > Send proposals A FEW DAYS BEFORE the deadline; only in this case can
      proposers be notified if the file fails to print !!
 > Write a 3-4 word title as the subject line for proposal identification
 > Avoid grey-scale plots and scanned graphics, which can create very 
      lengthy files.
 > Avoid sending proposals in duplicate
 > DO NOT send the file as a MAIL ATTACHMENT !
 > IF you specify paper size for printing, only use size A4 for "proposevn"
      (but do NOT specify A4 size for "propsoc")

WHAT TO INCLUDE
===============
All proposals should include the VLBI proposal cover sheet (see below) and a
text NOT EXCEEDING 2 SIDES. This should contain both a scientific and
a technical justification for the resources requested. It should include a 
brief summary of any related EVN proposals which have already been observed
or scheduled. Proposers should indicate if it is a resubmission of an earlier
proposal. Up to 2 additional sides with diagrams may be included; the total,
including cover sheet, should not exceed 6 sides. 

 > Proposers should identify any individual antenna(s) whose inclusion is
    considered ESSENTIAL for achieving their goals

 > Only a limited amount of time is available at some antennas for joint 
    observations with the EVN - these include MERLIN, ARECIBO and the DSN.
    A SPECIAL JUSTIFICATION is needed for requesting any of these facilities.

 > Requests for use of the CAMBRIDGE antenna without MERLIN will not normally
    be accepted. A strong scientific case for its inclusion must be presented,
    and such requests will only be granted at the discretion of the Director,
    MERLIN/VLBI National Facility (UK), for highly rated proposals.

 > Only a limited amount of time is available for observations requiring
    rapid source changes (e.g. phase-referencing) using the Lovell 
    Telescope at Jodrell Bank. A special justification must be presented.

THE VLBI PROPOSAL COVERSHEET
============================
The VLBI Proposal Coversheet must be used for all proposals. The up-to-date
version should be obtained via the EVN USER GUIDE at the EVN WWW Home Page
or directly from:    http://www.nfra.nl/jive/evn/proposals/prop.html
File  covervlbi.tex  contains instructions for filling in the cover sheet.

 > Select a wavelength band
 > Select a recording format compatible with the requested correlator
      (select "VLBA" for VLBA-compatible MKIV modes)
 > For SPECTRAL LINE proposals, specify the exact observing frequencies
    and the (baseband) channel bandwidths
 > Select EVN antennas using the 2-character codes given in the EVN STATUS
    TABLE.
 > For EVN+MERLIN proposals, add "MERLIN" to the EVN antenna list
 > Specify the GST ranges for Asian antennas separately, if appropriate
 > For selection of Processor (Correlator) see below

CORRELATION OF EVN OBSERVATIONS
===============================
It is expected that in 2000 the EVN MKIV Data Processor at JIVE will be
operational for the correlation of all basic MK3 and VLBA/MKIV observing
and recording modes. Most EVN observations will be correlated at JIVE.
A few modes (including pulsar gating, space VLBI and 2-head/320 ips recording)
will not initially be available. All EVN proposals are subject to a technical
assessment by JIVE correlator staff, and the feasibility of correlation is
discussed during EVN proposal review. For further technical details, 
proposers should consult the Manager of JIVE Correlator Science Operations, 
H.J.van Langevelde:  huib@jive.nfra.nl

The MPIfR MKIII correlator in Bonn is still available for correlation of EVN  
observations MADE IN 1999, but WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE for observations made
in 2000. After the installation of the new MKIV correlator in Bonn, limited
time may be available for correlation of EVN MKIII or VLBA/MKIV mode 
observations, but only if special justification is given in the proposal.

The VLBA correlator in Socorro is available for a limited number of 
"EVN-only" experiments. Its use will be reserved for those observations  
which cannot yet be correlated at JIVE, as judged by the EVN Program 
Committee. Proposers must request a VLBA/MK4-compatible recording mode,   
and consult the "List of validated VLBA or VLBA-compatible MKIV recording    
modes", available in the EVN User Guide under "Scheduling EVN Observations".

Proposers of GLOBAL projects must use VLBA/MKIV-compatible recording modes.
In principle, either the VLBA correlator or the EVN correlator at JIVE may be
requested. However, as initial priority at JIVE will given to the correlation
of EVN-only projects, proposers are advised to request the VLBA correlator
until the JIVE operational throughput has been established, unless there are
technical reasons for selecting it.

 >>  The EVN Program Committee will consider carefully the correlator 
 >>  requested for each proposal submitted, and may suggest a change 
 >>  of correlator if this seems appropriate.

SHORT OBSERVATIONS
==================
"Short" observations (< 4 hours) may be proposed up to 6 weeks before an
observing session begins, by means of a brief justification to the 
Chairman of the EVN PC, who will, at his discretion, authorise scheduling
in any gaps in the session plan. They are intended to allow the EVN to
respond to urgent "targets of opportunity", or to facilitate short, pilot
observations, if needed in preparation for a full proposal. They can only
be granted limited resources (number of telescopes, tapes, correlator time)
and must use standard recording modes. They should not involve any special
observing set-ups.  The present EVNPC Chairman is:  Richard Porcas, MPIfR, 
Auf dem Huegel 69, D 53121, Bonn, Germany.  FAX: +49 (0)228-525229 ;
TELEPHONE: +49 (0)228-525288 ;       E-mail: porcas@mpifr-bonn.mpg.de

ACCESS TO PROPOSAL INFORMATION
==============================
Note that the following data from the proposal will be stored in machine-
readable form:  PI name and email, wavelength, observing mode, program title,
requested telescopes, EVNPC rating. The data will be distributed to the EVN
Scheduler, VLBA scheduler and to members of the EVNPC. For proposals supported
under the TMR program "Access to Large-Scale Facilities", the title, author
list, and amount of time granted (or a brief reason for rejection) will be
made available to the EU Commission in Brussels.  Copies of all EVN+MERLIN
proposals will be made available to the MERLIN TAC Chairman, together with
the EVNPC rating. Coversheets of proposals requesting use of the VLBA
correlator will be forwarded to NRAO for checking technical feasibility.
Copies of proposals requesting ARECIBO will be forwarded to the Arecibo
Observatory for technical review.
