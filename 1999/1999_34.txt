Session 1:  Colloquium (2:30 - 3:30 pm)

	    TITLE:   "Synthesis of heavy elements via rapid neutron capture. 
	              II. Probing properties of neutrino dark matter"
	    ABSTRACT:
Essentially all of the gravitational binding energy of the neutron star
produced in a supernova explosion is carried away by neutrinos and 
antineutrinos of all flavors. Neutrinos with masses of several eV have been
proposed as the hot dark matter important for structure formation in the
Universe. These massive neutrinos would oscillate between different flavors
in supernovae. I discuss the effect of such flavor oscillations on the
supernova r-process and derive constraints on the oscillation parameters
assuming supernovae to be the r-process site. These constraints are compared
with the results from laboratory neutrino oscillation experiments. 




Session 2:  Colloquium (3:45 -- 4:45 pm)

            SPEAKER: Dr. Shigehisa Takakuwa 
                     (University of Tokyo & 
                      Nobeyama Radio Observatory, NAO)
	    TITLE:   "Physical & Chemical Evolution of Pre-stellar Dense  
	              Molecular Cloud Cores Probed by the H13CO+ and CH3OH 
	              Lines in the TMC-1C Region
	    ABSTRACT:
In order to understand the evolutionary processes of dense molecular cloud 
cores before the onset of the initial collapse to form stars, that is, 
the evolution of pre-stellar dense cores, we have carried out 
observational studies of pre-stellar dense cores using the 45 m telescope at 
Nobeyama Radio Observatory and the Nobeyama Millimeter Array (NMA).

We have made mapping observations for the TMC-1C region 
in Taurus Molecular Cloud with H$^{13}$CO$^{+}$ (J=1-0), and CH$_{3}$OH 
(J$_{K}$=2$_{0}$-1$_{0}$ A$^{+}$) lines using the NRO 45 m telescope. 
Since TMC-1C contains no proto-stellar sources and is close to 
the Sun (140 pc), it is suitable for the study pre-stellar cores. 
Both H$^{13}$CO$^{+}$ and CH$_{3}$OH lines trace high density molecular gas 
above 10$^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$, and are optically thin in typical dark cloud 
conditions. Thus, these two molecular probes are useful for the study of the 
internal structures of pre-stellar cores. 

We found that the spatial distributions of cores seen in H$^{13}$CO$^{+}$ 
emission are quite different from those seen in CH$_{3}$OH emission, although 
their overall physical properties are similar (size $\sim$ 0.07 pc, 
line width $\sim$ 0.3 km s$^{-1}$, and mass $\sim$ 2 M$_{\odot}$). 
The excitation analyses based on a LVG model have revealed that 
the difference must be attributed to the variation in the relative abundance 
between these two molecular species by about one order of magnitude. 
Chemical evolutional models in molecular clouds have suggested that the 
abundance of CH$_{3}$OH takes its maximum in the earlier evolutionary stages and 
decreases grealty toward the later stages, while the abundance of 
H$^{13}$CO$^{+}$ increases toward the later stages.

Our observations demonstrated that two molecular emissions, each of which may 
trace a different evolutionary stage of pre-stellar cores, actually show
different spatial distribution of pre-stellar cores in TMC-1C.
In addition to these observations of TMC-1C, we made an extensive survey of 
H$^{13}$CO$^{+}$ and CH$_{3}$OH in the Heiles Cloud 2, finding that 
the H$^{13}$CO$^{+}$ line is well associated with protostars, while the 
CH$_{3}$OH line is not associated with them. Taking these results into 
consideration, we suggest that observations with two molecular emissions, 
each of which traces a different evolutionary stage in the pre-stellar cores,
may be important to study the physical evolution of the pre-stellar cores.

Subsequently, in order to clarify the detailed internal structures of these 
pre-stellar cores at different evolutionary stages, 
we have carried out interferometric observations with the NMA for the 
representative 
H$^{13}$CO$^{+}$ and CH$_{3}$OH cores. we have discovered several ``clumps'' 
($\leq$ 1000 AU, $\sim$ 0.04 M$_{\odot}$) inside these pre-stellar cores.
Such clumps must be important to understand how to initiate star formation
in the pre-stellar cores.
