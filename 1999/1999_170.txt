The Third VLBI Space Observatory Programme (VSOP) ANNOUNCEMENT OF OPPORTUNITY

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Third VSOP Announcement of Opportunity (AO3) was released on September 1st.
Proposals, which cover the use of both the HALCA satellite and ground radio 
telescopes, must reach the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science by
October 1, 1999. Future calls for VSOP proposals will occur three times per 
year, coordinated with the calls for proposals by the ground VLBI networks, 
with subsequent due dates on 1 February, 1 June, etc.  

Proposals submitted for AO3 can be scheduled as early as mid-January 2000.  
It is important to submit proposals at this deadline for those regions of the 
sky which have good (u-v) coverage between January and May 2000 (see below).  
Proposals for sources in other regions of sky which can be observed in the 
next year, and for long-term monitoring programs, will also be accepted at 
this deadline.

The information needed to submit a VSOP proposal is available from

                 http://www.vsop.isas.ac.jp/obs/AO.html .

This includes the Third VSOP Announcement of Opportunity, AO3 Cover Sheets,
Proposer's Guide, and Suggestions for Proposers.  All-sky (u,v)-coverage plots
for each month of 2000 and 2001 using HALCA with illustrative ground arrays
can be inspected to determine when observations of a particular source are 
most suitable. A summary of changes from AO2 is also available for those 
already familiar with VSOP observing.  An e-mail help desk has been set up
at   vsop_help@vsop.isas.ac.jp   to answer any questions proposers may have.
A listing of all successfully observed and currently scheduled AO1 and AO2 
observations will be available shortly.

The cover sheets and scientific justification must reach ISAS no later than 
October 1, 1999.  The cover sheets (Latex file) must be submitted by e-mail.
The scientific justification can be sent by e-mail in postscript form or by 
surface mail. Submission one or two days before the deadline is recommended for
postscript files to ensure there are no problems with printing the proposal.
