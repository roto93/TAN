Dear colleague,

Under the supervision and hardwork of Prof. Y-Chen Cheng of NTU, Physical
Society has been running a webpage that I think is educational,
informative and useful to all physicists worldwide.  It can be found at 
*******************************
http://psroc.phys.ntu.edu.tw/
*******************************
Prof. Cheng has managed to put both the chinese Physics Bimonthly and
english research journal Chinese Journal of Physics published by the
Society on line.  There are also job informations, funding opportunity
information etc..  More information will be added in the future.  Please
give your comments and suggestions to me at
chang@phys.nthu.edu.tw
and to Prof. Cheng at 
yccheng@phys.ntu.edu.tw
Your suggestions can make the page even more useful to everybody.  Note
that Physical Society is run by a group of professors/volunteers
(especially the hard works of Prof. Yang-Fang Chen, editor of CJP, and
Prof. Ikai Lo, editor of Phyiscs).  Your patient and help will be deeply
appreciated.

Recently, to make it more useful to the students and the society at large,
we had also created a physics Question and Answer (Q&A) page at 
****************************************
http://psroc.phys.ntu.edu.tw/Q&A1.html
****************************************
and invited Prof. Tsay-Ming Hong as the coordinator the page.  The page
welcomes everybody to submit question or post alternative answers to the
existing questions.  All the posting will be sent to and reviewed by the
coordinator before posted.  So far, all the questions are roughly at the
high school or junior college level.  We plan to expand this service to
cover questions at different levels and organize a team of experts to help
Prof. Hong handling harder, more diverse questions.  We hope it will
become a major hub for physics discussion.
Please advertise this page and function to your students and colleagues 
and we hope you can frequent this page yourself to answer or post
questions.

Sincerely,
Darwin Chang
President 
Physical Society of ROC
