The Seventh Summer School in Synthesis Imaging will take place from
June 20 (Tuesday) through June 27 (Tuesday) of 2000.  The summer
school will be hosted by the National Radio Astronomy Observatory
(NRAO) and by the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology and
held in the Workman center on the Tech campus in Socorro, New Mexico.
Data reduction tutorials on June 23 at the Array Operations Center
(AOC) will allow attendees to get "hands-on" experience with data
calibration and imaging for both VLA and VLBA data.  NRAO scientific
staff will be available at the AOC to aid and advise participants.  A
tour of the VLA site will be given on June 24.

The Summer School will cover all basic aspects of radio
interferometry, including both connected element (e.g. the VLA) and
Very Long Baseline interferometers (e.g. the VLBA).  Lectures will be
given by the NRAO staff, faculty from New Mexico Tech, Caltech, and by
staff members of other observatories.  The range of subjects will be
similar to past Summer Schools, and can be reviewed by consulting
"Synthesis Imaging in Radio Astronomy II", the published collection of
lectures from the 6th NRAO Synthesis Imaging Summer School (ASP
Conference Series, Volume 180, 1999).  The lectures will be given at a
level appropriate for graduate students in astrophysics.  There will
be ample time for questions and discussion following each lecture and
at the end of each day.  The registration fee will include a copy of
Volume 180 in the registration package.

There will be a limit on attendance of 150 people.  A fee of $105 will
be assessed, sufficient only to cover our local expenses and a copy of
Vol. 180.  No financial assistance will be possible.  The registration
fee will include transportation to and from the Albuquerque airport on
June 19, and on June 27 or 28, daily transportation to/from hotels,
and a tour of the VLA on June 24.  A summer school dinner, held
outdoors on the New Mexico Tech Campus, on Friday evening is also
included in the registration fee.

Rooms will be blocked out at Socorro motels for the school, and
information on these motels will be sent to participants in a general
mailing in February of 2000.  The daily cost of a single currently
ranges from $35-$70 and sharing a double from $19-$42 per person
including tax.  Motel registration will be the responsibility of the
attendees.

To indicate your interest in attending the summer school, please
register electronically by directing your web browser to
http://www.nrao.edu/~gtaylor/synth2000.html, and following the
directions for electronic registration.  More information about the
meeting, hotel accommodations, and the town of Socorro is available
from the web page.
