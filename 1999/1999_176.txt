a hefty portion of the science which ALMA will address:
 Investigation of galaxies near the time of their formation at very 
        high redshift; 
 Detection and study of planets around nearby stars; 
 Study of star formation by, for example, high-resolution submillimeter 
        observations of protostars, protoplanetary disks, and outflows; and 
 Study of the origin, distribution and evolution of the elements and 
        their isotopes; 

Posters will be displayed on boards in the reception hall outside the auditorium
and remain up for the duration of the meeting, 8:00 am, 7 October through

                   Getting to Washington

Washington D.C. is served by three major airports.  

Dulles International Airport to the west handles many 
international flights, with road connections to the city. You may take a
van into town. 

National Airport lies just across the
Potomac from the Mall, with convenient Metro access to the city.
Metro information is available at http://www.wmata.com/
The hotel is nearest the Woodley Park/National Zoo stop on the Red Line,
about 25 minutes from National Airport; change from the yellow line at
Gallery Place.

Baltimore-Washington International (BWI) Airport lies to the north, and has
convenient rail access to the city.  BWI is served by Icelandic Airways
and by Southwest Airlines, along with most major airlines, and 
frequently boasts the most reasonably priced fares.  From BWI, take the
Penn Line of MARC south to Washington, where you can travel to Union Station
for a connection to METRO, the Washington subway system.  The Red line
stops at Union Station and runs to the Woodley Park stop near the hotel.
The MARC trains run generally every 40 minutes or so; the schedule is at:
http://www.mtamaryland.com/marc/marc_sch_penn_s.htm
MARC does not operate on weekends or on Colmbus Day (11 Oct).  
There are van shuttle services to the city also.

Amtrak runs trains into Union Station.

Clear skies,
Al
