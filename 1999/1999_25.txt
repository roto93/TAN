1. General Description
***************************************************************************=
*

We are pleased to announce the upcoming conference entitled "Astrophysical
Dynamics" hosted by the University of =C9vora in spring 1999. The main
purpose of the conference is to pay a scientific tribute to the
outstanding and pioneering achievements of Franz Kahn, late Emeritus
Professor of Astronomy of the University of Manchester and Fellow of the
Royal Society, who sadly passed away in February, 1998. The scientific
programme is intended to follow the path in cosmical gas dynamics set out
by Franz Kahn's research career. In appreciation of his significant work,
the major emphasis of the meeting is on theoretical developments in
astrophysical dynamics.=20

The conference will be divided into the following broad themes:

I)   Galactic Dynamics:
     Spiral structure, large scale gas dynamics, galactic fountains.
    =20
II)  Diffuse Matter:
     Star formation, stellar winds, HII regions, planetary Nebulae, superno=
va
     remnants, superbubbles, bipolar outflows.=20
     =20
III) Cosmic Rays:
     Cosmic Ray acceleration, cosmic Ray propagation.
      =20
IV)  Pulsars:
     Pulsar magnetospheres & electrodynamics, observation of pulsars.

The following speakers have been invited to give review talks during the co=
nference:

D. Breitschwerdt (MPE, Germany)
A. da Costa      (IST, Portugal)
M. Dopita        (MSSSO, Australia)

9. Travel
***************************************************************************=
*

=C9vora is located approximately 140 km (90 miles) east of Lisbon, Portugal=
's=20
capital.

Getting to Portugal:

If you are planning to fly to Portugal, you will be flying into Lisbon. If
you are renting a car at the airport, we recommend that you ask for
directions to the highway going over the new bridge "ponte Vasco da Gama"
(more details in the section By Car). If you are planning taking public
transport from Lisbon to =C9vora, make sure that your flight arrives NO
LATER than approximately 17:00. The latest bus leaves Lisbon for =C9vora at
19:00, and you do not want to be stranded in Lisbon. If you have no other
option, contact us and we will try to make arrangements to meet you at the
airport.=20

Getting to =C9vora from the airport:

-By Bus
The Express Bus is the best public transportation to take. The trip takes
about one hour 45 minutes and a single ticket costs 1 400 Escudos. The
last bus of the day leaves Lisbon for =C9vora at 19:00. From the airport,
you should take a taxi to the Rodovi=E1ria Nacional at Arco do Cego. As
there is more than one bus station, make sure you specify "Arco do Cego".
Depending on the amount of luggage you bring, your taxi fare should be no
more than about 1 000 Escudos. (Please refer to the homepage (in English)
of Rodovi=E1ria Nacional for more details: www.rede-expressos.pt).=20

-By Car
The route from the airport is very straightforward. Ask for directions for
the motorway going over the new bridge "ponte Vasco da Gama" and continue
along the motorway until you reach the motorway A12. Proceed along the A12
until you reach junction 2 with the A2-IP1. Once in the A2, proceed
eastwards until about halfway in the journey (65 km/40 miles from the
airport) where the motorway to =C9vora bears right (junction 6) joining the
A6-IP7. Keep on the A6 until junction 5 where you turn off and you will
need to pay a toll of 1 240 Escudos. Follow the signs to =C9vora on a high
road for another 10 km (6 miles) until you reach the city.

-By Train
We do not recommend the train, because the service is under major
redevelopments at the moment.=20
