UC Berkeley, SETI Institute join forces to build the world's largest
telescope devoted principally to the search for extra-terrestrial
intelligence

Berkeley/Mountain View, Calif. - The University of California, Berkeley,
and the SETI Institute have teamed up to design and build an array of
500 to 1,000 radio telescopes whose primary task will be to seek out
signals from civilizations elsewhere in our galaxy.

Rather than construct one large and expensive radio telescope like the
famous dish at Arecibo, Puerto Rico, or even an array of many large,
custom-built telescopes like the Very Large Array in New Mexico, the UC
Berkeley/SETI Institute team will explore the use of many inexpensive
antennas similar to those used for backyard TV reception.  By
electronically coupling many dishes together, a large "radio ear" can be
constructed at a fraction of the cost of more conventional approaches.
The project is estimated to cost less than $25 million, and could be
completed by 2004.

"This represents a paradigm shift in the design and construction of
radio telescopes," said Jill Tarter, science team leader for the
Institute's current SETI program. "We hope to demonstrate that a premium
instrument need not have a premium price."

UC Berkeley researchers emphasize, though, that the novel array will be
spectacular for radio astronomy, too.  Because of its unique
construction, the telescope could be used simultaneously for SETI and
other radio astronomy observations.

"The instrument we want to build will have unique capabilities for
observing objects from the solar system to the edge of the Universe,"
said Leo Blitz, director of the UC Berkeley Radio Astronomy Lab and
professor of astronomy.  "Our goal is nothing short of standing the way
radio astronomy has been done up to now on its head."

The array will eventually comprise a total collecting area of 10,000
square meters, or one hectare (2.47 acres), hence the project's current
name, the One Hectare Telescope, or 1hT.  When completed, the 1hT will
be among the world's largest radio telescopes.  By comparison, the
Arecibo telescope, which is the world's largest, is 1,000 feet in
diameter and has a collecting area of about 73,000 square meters (about
18 acres).

Once completed, the 1hT will be the world's largest observing facility
devoted substantially to SETI.  SETI observations require not only a
large collecting area-to find the weak signals expected from a
transmitter many light years away-but also highly sophisticated digital
receivers to scrutinize millions of radio channels.

For SETI observations, dedicated time on large radio telescopes is
scarce and expensive.  The result for SETI is less than optimal; at
best, SETI scientists are able to scan only a few hundred star systems
per year.  The 1hT would allow this number to expand at least tenfold.
In the Milky Way Galaxy alone, there are an estimated 400 billion stars.

"UC Berkeley has one of the world's premier radio astronomy programs,
along with first-rate programs in engineering and computer science, "
said Tarter.  "Together, we can design and build an instrument for that
will have no peer for this type of work."

The first goal will be to build a prototype composed of perhaps a dozen
small radio dishes at UC Berkeley's Hat Creek Observatory, located near
Mt. Lassen in northern California.  The Hat Creek Observatory is the
site of the ten-telescope array now operated by UC Berkeley, called BIMA
(Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland Array).  Once the 1hT concept has been
proven and the electronics are working, the team would embark on the
construction of an array of up to 1,000 telescopes, probably also at Hat
Creek.  The number of telescopes will depend on the ultimate size of the
individual dishes, which could be 12 feet or 18 feet in diameter,
whichever provides the most cost-effective solution.

The design concept of the 1hT should significantly reduce the cost of
construction, according to UC Berkeley and SETI Institute researchers.
A comparably sized instrument, the 300-foot Green Bank Telescope now
under construction at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in West
Virginia, will cost at least $75 million.  The 1hT, whose sensitivity at
the frequencies of interest to SETI will be similar to the Green Bank
Telescope, is predicted to cost less than one-third as much as that
instrument.  The smaller telescopes of the 1hT would also be much less
expensive to maintain.

Unlike conventional radio telescopes, the 1hT is also scalable.  By
adding new dishes to the array, the 1hT could be made larger at
relatively low cost.  And while damage to the collecting surface of a
traditional radio telescope is expensive and time-consuming to repair,
the individual dishes of the 1hT can be replaced quickly and cheaply.

UC Berkeley's lead astronomer on the 1hT project, Professor of
Astronomy William "Jack" Welch, plans to support a targeted SETI search
in addition to conducting observations of star-forming regions.  The
newly-appointed Watson and Marilyn Alberts Chair for SETI at UC
Berkeley, Welch said that the 1hT team will begin the search with 1,000
nearby sun-like stars and gradually moving outward to encompass 100,000
then one million candidate stars in our galaxy.  The team will search
for strong signals at a single frequency - like radar or radio
broadcasts from Earth - as well as pulsed signals that repeat.  The 1hT
computer system will conduct an analysis, to be performed eventually by
a receiver on a mass-produced integrated circuit chip, designed to alert
researchers immediately to signals of interest.

Funds for the 1hT will be raised from private sources under the
direction of the SETI Institute.  The Institute's Project Phoenix is
currently the world's largest privately supported radio astronomy
enterprise, with an annual budget of more than $3 million.

Blitz and Tarter note that the 1hT would also prove the feasibility of
an even larger array of telescopes-perhaps as many as 100,000-with a
total collecting area of a square kilometer, or one million square
meters.  This so-called Square Kilometer Array (SKA) is being developed
as a major international collaboration for radio astronomers in the next
century.  If built, the SKA would surpass Arecibo as the world's largest
radio telescope.
