                     THE NEW ERA OF WIDE-FIELD ASTRONOMY
                             21 - 24 AUGUST 2000

                             FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT


The conference is prompted by the success of the UK Joint Infrastructure
Fund bid for VISTA - the Visible and Infrared Survey Telescope for Astronomy
- a 4-m survey telescope to be constructed in Chile by late 2003.

We are at the beginning of a new era in wide-field astronomy, with major new
surveys now in production, and with new telescopes and instruments, both
ground- and space-based, scheduled to be in production in the next few years.
This conference aims to review the present and future of this exciting new
era of wide-field astronomy, and to discuss the optimum exploitation of the
remarkable range of new facilities.

The conference will cover all aspects of the new era - cosmology and both
extragalactic and galactic astronomy, from X-ray to radio. Themes include
the following.

   * The new generation of telescopes and instruments (for example, VISTA,
     VST, XMM, Chandra, SALT, MegaPrime, OmegaCAM, UKIRT WF, 6dF).
   * Astronomy and cosmology being done now (AAT 2dF, INT-WFC, SDSS, ELAIS,
     EIS).
   * Astronomy and cosmology that will be possible in future (VISTA/Gemini,
     XMM, Chandra, MAP, Planck).
   * Data access and analysis.

The proceedings of the conference will be published.


INVITED SPEAKERS:

   * Brian Boyle (AAO)
   * Mark Casali (Edinburgh)
   * Richard Ellis (IoA/Caltech)
   * Jim Emerson (QMW)
   * Richard McMahon (Cambridge)
   * Christian Motch (Strasbourg)
   * Rick Perley (NRAO)
   * Alex Szalay (Johns Hopkins)
   * Fred Watson (AAO)


Preston is an historic but modern town in the northwest of England, 34 miles
(55 km) north of Manchester, with efficient communications to Manchester
International Airport and all major cities in the United Kingdom. The famous
Lake District, the Forest of Bowland (an area of outstanding natural
beauty), and the Yorkshire Dales are all nearby. The conference is directly
after the IAU 2000 events in Manchester.
