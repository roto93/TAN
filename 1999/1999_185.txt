Dear ISO Observer,

As you might know, all the ISO data are now in the public domain and
available from the archive at:

                  http://www.iso.vilspa.esa.es/

We are currently compiling (and wish to keep updated) a list of all 
publications arising from ISO data. Obviously, we are scanning the
literature and using the various search capabilities; however, to help
ensure that our lists are as complete and accurate as possible, we need 
your help. Appended to this mail you will find a list we have compiled 
of the _refereed_ publications by you that have come from your ISO
programme(s). Note that the list also contains our best identification
of the specific observations used in each publication. I ask you to
check this list and inform the ISO Helpdesk (helpdesk@iso.vilspa.esa.es)
of any corrections or additions (including any non-refereed papers). I
would also greatly appreciate you continuing to inform helpdesk of
future papers; a WWW page will be established to make this chore as easy
as possible.

We plan to include the publications list in future versions of the
archive and also intend to have detailed links between the observing
programmes and the resulting publications. Additionally, we are thinking
of including in the public archive data reduced to publication level by
the observer. Your inputs on these topics, via the attached
mini-questionnaire, will be greatly appreciated.

To help the community maximise their return from their ISO
observations, a network of 7 ISO data centres has been set up, for
details see 

   http://www.iso.vilspa.esa.es/users/post_ops/post_operations.html

Should you require help via a visit to a data centre (or remotely via
e-mail) please contact the specialists at these centres for assistance.
They will be pleased to try to help you get your data reduced for
publication.

May I also ask you to spend a few minutes answering the following
questions so that we may tune the services of the data centres and
the data archive to your needs.

Thanking you in advance,  
With best regards,

Martin Kessler
ISO Project Scientist

     1.1 which data centre did you visit?
          [ ] ISO Data Centre, Vilspa, Spain
          [ ] French ISO Centres, Saclay/Orsay, France
          [ ] ISOPHOT Data Centre, Heidelberg, Germany
          [ ] ISO Spectrometer Data Centre, Garching, Germany

          [ ] none
      1.2 what tools did you use?
          [ ] CIA      
          [ ] PIA
          [ ] OSIA
          [ ] SIA
          [ ] LIA 
          [ ] ISAP
          [ ] other   Which? ............................
          [ ] own tools
     1.3 to what extent did the processed data meet your scientific
         expectations?
         ................................................
         ................................................
     1.4 did the data lead to publications? 
         [ ] yes  
             [ ] published
             [ ] in press
             [ ] submitted
         [ ] no
         If yes, please complete question 3.
         If no, how can the data centres help you? 
         ................................................
         ................................................

  If your ISO data is not, or is only partially, reduced:
     1.5 what is/are the main reasons for the current status?
          [ ] lack of time and/or funding
          [ ] other projects taking priority
          [ ] lack of tools to reduce the data
          [ ] don't know how to reduce the data
          [ ] other. Please comment.
          Comments: ............................................
     1.6 the data centres organise "hands-on" data workshops of duration
         about a week focussing on very specific topics.  Please suggest
         any topics that would help you:
         ................................................
         ................................................


2. We are planning to include user-reduced data into the ISO Data
   Archive.  The format of such data is under definition but the
   intention is to minimise any extra work for the person supplying the
   reduced data back to the archive.
   Would you, in principle, be willing to provide your final reduced 
   data sets (plus information on the reduction processing) to the ISO
   Data Archive?
   [ ] yes    [ ] no
   Comments: ............................................


3. We are planning to provide through the archive links from
   observations to articles based on them. Therefore we request you
   to check the observations used for the publications listed below. For  
   simplicity, you may identify any observations either by: 
   1) target name as in the proposal, or
   2) observation number (the sequence number of the observation in the
      proposal), or
   3) TDT number (simplest for archive; this is the 8 digit number in the
      data file names).
   We have included all three in the list below.

   Corrections?.........................................................

   Additions?...........................................................

   Despite our tracking of publications based on ISO Data, we ask that
   you continue to inform us of your future publications.  This is 
   especially important in view of getting the linking between articles
   and used observations as correct as possible.  We intend to 
   establish a WWW page to make this process more convenient.
