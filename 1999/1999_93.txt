Update on Lodging, Childcare and Job Center

194th MEETING OF THE AMERICAN ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY
30 May - 3 June 1999, CHICAGO, ILLINOIS

HILTON
It has come to our attention that many people have had problems 
making reservations at the Hilton Chicago and Towers Hotel for 
the 194th Meeting.  Their website was down for several weeks and 
erroneous information regarding room availability was given by some 
hotel staff.  The deadline for reservations has been extended to 
Thursday, 6 May. There are currently rooms available.  Reservation 
forms can be accessed through the online Program:

	http://www.aas.org/meetings/aas194/program/

If you experience any problems, contact Diana Alexander in the 
Executive Office, 202-328-2010, diana@aas.org.


CHILDCARE
We are sorry to announce that the arrangements for childcare at 
the Chicago meeting have been canceled due to lack of participation.  
If we can locate possible sources for individual care arrangements, 
they will be posted in the online Program for your reference.  Again, 
we apologize for this cancellation, and hope that affected attendees 
will be able to negotiate other arrangements.


JOB CENTER 
Come to the AAS as an out-of-work astronomer and leave fully
employed!  It can happen to you if you take full advantage of
the  AAS Job Center.  To be prepared, take a look at the
AAS Job Center page (http://www.aas.org/JobRegister/jobcen.html),
get your resume in to the AAS office early along with your cover sheet 
or bring it along to the meeting.  Cover sheets and further instructions 
can be found on this page.  Once you are at the meeting, come by the 
Job Center early to register as a job seeker and pick up further 
instructions.  Then sign up for interviews and meet with your potential 
future employer.  Be prepared to interview, and check the Job Center 
regularly during the meeting for late-breaking jobs and interview slots.

If you are an employer, be sure to let AAS Career Services know
if you will be available for interviews by emailing jobs@aas.org
with your name, institution and position for which you will be conducting
interviews.  Be sure to check your interview slots frequently, as some
meeting attendees come for only one or two days and sign up late in the
meeting.
