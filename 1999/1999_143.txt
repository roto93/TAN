<bold>1.  MEMORANDUM

</bold>

To: ATNF Steering Committee members

From: Russell Cannon

Date: 27 July 1999

Subject: DATA RELEASE POLICIES FOR LARGE SURVEYS


At the last Steering Committee meeting in March, one of the agenda 
items

was a request from the Time Assignment Committee for us to endorse 
their

decision not to allocate any more observing time to the multi-beam
pulsar

survey until some pulsar data were released to the community.  The SC
had

a lively but somewhat abbreviated discussion at the end of our meeting. 

There was clearly very strong support for insisting that recipients of

large amounts of ATNF time should adhere to the official data-release

policies, but as Chair I was reluctant to agree to the Draconian step 
of

terminating the pulsar program abruptly without a better understanding
of

the issues. 


The Australian astronomer members of the SC had a further 
teleconference

meeting on 5 May at which this and other matters were further 
discussed,

and I undertook to speak with some of the main protagonists in the big

surveys and in the Australian pulsar community. 


The outcome of all this was that I prepared an "Interim Response" for
the

meeting of the TAC on 29-30 June.  I emphasised that this was a 
personal

report from me, and that I would consult the full membership of the SC
if

there were issues still to be resolved or points that the TAC did not

agree with.  My main findings and recommendations were that there were

valid reasons for having different data-release timescales for 
different

surveys, that neither the pulsar nor the HI survey teams had fully

complied with the originally agreed guidelines on data release, and 
that

neither survey should be cut at this stage but pressure should be

maintained (through the threat of curtailed observing allocations) to

ensure the prompt release of data. 


These recommendations were accepted by the TAC, and both the main 
survey

teams have undertaken to release their data on the WWW (some pulsar 
data

have already been released, partly as a result of this protracted
debate). 

I therefore believe that this issue has been resolved and that there 
are

no outstanding matters to be referred back to the SC, although both the

SC and the TAC will have to be vigilant in future to ensure that the
data

release policies are adhered to.  


Copies of the note I sent to the TAC and of the TAC's response are

attached.  I am sending these papers to all SC members to keep the

Committee fully informed.  Please let me know if you have any comments
or

if you feel that the issues need further discussion now.

<bold>2. RELEASE OF DATA FROM THE MAJOR PARKES MULTI-BEAM PROJECTS 

</bold>

An interim response to the AT TAC, 29 June 1999


Russell Cannon (as Chair of ATNF Steering Committee)


The AT TAC has requested guidance from the Steering Committee on the

policy for public access to data from large surveys.  This has been

precipitated by the considerable difference between the stated

data-release intentions of the two main teams, and the lack of

publications from the pulsar survey compared with the HI multi-beam

surveys.  At its last meeting in December 1998, the TAC threatened not

to allocate any more time to the pulsar survey unless some progress

was made in releasing data.


The following notes are my personal summary of the current situation.

Although this was on the agenda for the 1999 Steering Committee

meeting in March, there was insufficient time then for a thorough

discussion.  I therefore undertook to speak with some of the

protagonists, both inside and outside the survey teams.  My findings

so far are summarised below.  It would be very helpful now to have the

reactions of the TAC.  If there are still major issues requiring

urgent resolution, I can consult with the Steering Committee members

by e-mail.



1. General considerations.


In principle, probably all data from large projects carried out on

national facilities should be made freely available within a year or

two of the original observations.  However, in practice the situation

is often not clear-cut.


(i) Raw data are not of much use to outsiders.  This is especially

true of the pulsar survey, where the data volumes are enormous and a

large amount of pre-processing is necessary; however, HI multi-beam 
data

are also much more useful after some processing and calibration.


(ii) The teams carrying out the surveys must have some incentive for

doing the work, and receive some tangible benefit from it.  In some

cases, what matters is the entire survey since the teams do not want

to be scooped by outsiders doing the astrophysical analysis on subsets

of the data; in other cases, probably including the pulsar survey,

the most important science involves rare individual objects.


(iii) What is meant by open release of data?  Ultimately it must mean

free world-wide access, but some argue that since the ATNF is a

national facility, other Australian astronomers (i.e. non-team members)

should have some priority ahead of the rest of the world.  On the

other hand, the Hubble Deep Field surveys have shown how beneficial

the prompt release of data can be, both for the advancement of science

and for raising the profile of the facility doing a survey.



2. Current situation and stated intentions.


The key questions are: (i) for how long should survey data remain

proprietorial? (ii) what constitutes a useful release of data?


(a) The pulsar survey.


The stated policy of the pulsar survey (on the WWW, as of March 1999)

is to issue lists of pulsars after acceptance for publication or 18

months after confirmation of detection, whichever comes first, and to

release the raw data 2 years after recording (together with software

to make the raw data useable).  In a subsequent message (4 May 1999),

Dick Manchester proposed releasing the raw data after 18 months also.


There is a list of 46 single pulsars found so far on the WWW; there is

also a summary, saying that 45% of the survey has been done, 30% of

the data reduced and some 360 new pulsars found (equal to half the

previously known total).  Both these reports are undated.  The survey

effectively started in August 1997, so data should have started to

appear about now, on the pulsar team's own guidelines. 


In his May e-mail and in subsequent discussion, Dick has made a case

for being given 18 months to determine a timing solution, and hence an

accurate position, before releasing new pulsars.  12 months is the

minimum period for a good timing solution, and the initial discovery

observation is rarely useful in the solution, so the elapsed time from

first discovery would be about 2 years if this is accepted.  Such a

policy would give the pulsar team less than 12 months for any

follow-up observations, either radio or optical; Dick argues that this

is the timescale which should be compared with the rules applied to

the HI and other surveys.


Data on some specific objects are being made available to others by

private arrangement, sometimes on condition of joint authorship of

papers, sometimes not.



(b) The multi-beam surveys.


The stated HIPASS policy is to release reduced data cubes twelve

months after taking the data, with access to raw or calibrated data by

arrangement.


So far as I am aware no data have yet been made openly available,

because the automatic data reduction and calibration procedures are

not yet finalised.  Although there is a good deal of information about

the surveys on the WWW, it is not easy for an outsider to get a quick

view of how much of the sky has been covered or what data are

available.  



(c) Publications.


The publication of papers based on the surveys is not the same thing

as the release of the survey data, although publication is obviously

important as an indication of activity within the survey teams and as

a measure of the significance of the observations.


The WWW pages list no publications from the pulsar survey.  The HI

surveys by contrast have about 30 publications, although the great

majority are conference reports.  I suspect that most of these are not

relevant to the primary issue of access to the data.



(d) Outside views.


I have consulted a few people who are interested in the results of the

pulsar survey but who are not themselves team members (in particular,

Simon Johnston at Sydney Uni. and Matthew Bailes at Swinburne Uni. as

pulsar specialists, and Ron Ekers as Director of ATNF and Chair of the

TAC).


No one seems to be suggesting that either the pulsar or the HI team is

failing to do good science, or that either team is simply piling up

data and doing nothing with it.  On the contrary, both teams are held

in very high regard by their peers.  This in itself makes it difficult

to support the idea of simply stopping the pulsar observations.


The main complaint of the outside pulsar specialists is that the

pulsar team does not have the resources to do all of the necessary or

desirable follow-up studies, and that the science could progress

faster if they could join in.  In many cases there would appear to be

little or no conflict of interest: Simon is particularly interested in

pulsar winds and interactions with the ISM, Matthew has carried out

his own independent survey for millisecond pulsars in fields outside

the main pulsar survey.



3. Suggestions and comments.


Clearly it is necessary to keep pressure on all survey teams to

reduce and release their data in a timely fashion.  This is essential

for efficient progress of the science, and to justify the large

investment of resources on a national facility.


On the basis of what I have learned so far, I offer the following

suggestions.  These could become formal recommendations if agreed to

by bodies such as the TAC and the Steering Committee, but I believe

that further discussion is needed before reaching that point.


(i) Similar basic rules should apply to all large surveys, but account

has to be taken of differences between the nature and objectives of

each survey.


(ii) Time is needed between data taking and data release, for two

quite distinct reasons: (a) to enable the data to be properly

calibrated and extracted, and (b) to give the survey teams an

opportunity to exploit their data.


(iii) In the case of the pulsar survey, allowing 18 months after the

confirmation of a detection seems a reasonable rule which will satisfy

both (a) and (b) above, and allow the pulsar team about 6 months of

proprietary rights.  Release of the raw pulsar data is of little use

to anyone outside the team.


(iv) For the HI survey, 12 months from the initial observations seems

reasonable ( assuming that the data pipeline will act almost

instantaneously once it is working).


(v) Until the HI survey actually starts to release data on a regular

basis 12 months after making observations, it would be unfair to

penalise the pulsar survey in favour of the HI survey.


(vi) Putting data on the WWW means it will be freely available to

everyone in the world.  This is as it should be, but it might not help

with the perceived problem that some Australian astronomers are not

getting adequate access to data from a national facility.


(vii) Encourage the survey proponents to share their data more widely,

especially where there is no conflict of interest or where the extra

input will help to get the data analysed and released sooner.


(viii) If any survey team fails to meet the targets for data release,

then begin to cut back (but not stop completely) their allocation of

observing time.

Dear Russell,


Thank you very much for your careful consideration of the complex issues
relating to data release policies for major surveys. The ATNF time
assignment committee discussed this at the meeting on 29-30th June and
your input was extremely helpful. 


The TAC has some feedback on your report. The following comments follow
the section numbers in your report: 


1iii) The data release policy does not favour astronomers in Australia
ahead of overseas astronomers. However the TAC is not aware that this is
an issue of concern to Australian astronomers who make use of the ATNF
facilities. This may need to be followed up further.


2a) The TAC is pleased to see that the pulsar group has put considerably
more information on the web. 


2b) The TAC agrees that for large surveys, information should be given on
the web to show which survey regions have been covered.


2c) The TAC agrees that publications and data release are essentially
unrelated issues.


3iii) For the Parkes pulsar survey, the TAC now accepts an 18 month data
release period following the confirmation of a detection, as defined by
the start of follow-up timing observations.


3vi) See our reply to 1iii). 


Yours sincerely, 


Jessica Chapman
