	{\bf STARS, GAS AND DUST IN GALAXIES: EXPLORING THE LINKS} \\
			MARCH 15- 18, 2000 \\
			 La Serena, Chile
\end{center}

\noindent
ORGANIZED BY: \\
Cerro Tololo InterAmerican Observatory, European Southern Observatory,
Las Campanas Observatory 

\medskip
\noindent
{\bf Background:} Understanding the many links between the various
layers of stellar populations and the various phases of the
interstellar medium within galaxies is important for a wide spectrum
of unsolved astrophysical problems -- from developing a proper model
of the ISM, to characterizing star formation on a global scale, to
galaxy formation and evolution...While the links are being
individually explored through different wavelength windows -- from X
rays to mm waves -- an up-to-date overview of the mass and energy
exchanges and budgets would be both timely and desirable. Therefore,
we propose, as a subject of the upcoming CTIO-ESO-LCO workshop, to
explore the links between stars, gas and dust within galaxies.  To
this end, we will bring together astronomers from many subdisciplines.
The format of a workshop will be ideal for making the best progress
towards investigating the feedbacks among all the components within a
galaxy. Moreover, holding the workshop in Chile -- the frontier for
many new facilities -- and having the workshop organized by
institutions which represent astronomers from both Europe and the USA
will hopefully break international as well as subdisciplinary
boundaries.

\medskip
\noindent
{\bf Scientific program:} The 4 days of the meeting will feature:
\begin{itemize}\itemsep=0pt\parsep=0pt\parskip=0pt
\item{Reviews covering the inventory of the ISM, interactions between
ISM phases, and ISM modelling tools}
\item{Reviews on stellar populations in galaxies near and far,
interaction of massive stars with the ISM, and modelling tools used in
stellar populations work}
\item{Reviews on the mass and energy budgets within galaxies and the
role of feedback in galaxy structure and evolution}
\item{Working groups to discuss key questions of galaxy physics,
followed by a panel discussion}
\end{itemize}

We welcome both oral and poster contributions related to these
subjects.

High--resolution observations of nearby dwarf irregular galaxies (in
particular IC\,2574 \& DDO\,47) in the 21\,cm line of neutral hydrogen
(HI) obtained with the Very Large Array reveal that their neutral
interstellar medium (ISM) is dominated by holes and shells, most of
which are expanding (the `violent' ISM).  These features range in size
from about 100 (a limit set by the size of the beam) to about
1000\,pc, dominating the appearance of the HI surface brightness maps
and influencing the velocity fields.  Current star formation, as
traced by H$\alpha$ emission, is predominantly found along the rims of
the larger HI holes, suggesting propagating star formation. On linear
scales of $\approx 100$~pc, star formation occurs if the HI surface
density reaches values higher than $10^{21}$~cm$^{-2}$.

The scale--height of the HI layer in the dwarf irregular galaxies
under study is found to be of order 400\,pc, considerably thicker than
that in massive disk galaxies. This is due to a lower gravitational
potential (for the same observed one--dimensional velocity dispersion
of $\approx 7$ km\,s$^{-1}$). This puffed up disk implies a rather low
HI volume density (0.15 cm$^{-3}$). This, combined with the reduced
gravitational pull, solid body rotation throughout the disk and the
absence of density waves explains why the diameter distribution in
dwarf galaxies extends to substantially larger values than in spiral
galaxies.

The radial expansion velocities of the HI holes (8--12 km\,s$^{-1}$),
the indicative ages (10--60 $\times10^6$ yr) and the energy
requirements for their formation ($10^{50}$--$10^{53}$ erg) can be
understood in terms of the combined effects of stellar winds and
multiple supernova explosions of the most massive stars formed during
a recent phase of active star formation.  A comparison with other
galaxies spanning a wide range of masses (M\,31, M\,33 and
Holmberg\,II) shows that, somewhat surprisingly, the energies needed
to create these structures are the same for all types of galaxies, at
least to first order.  The overall statistical properties of the HI
holes and shells in galaxies show clear trends with Hubble type (or
rather mass), such as in their diameter distribution, expansion
velocities and ages.

The origin of the HI holes and shells is still not fully settled. In
the standard picture, young star--forming regions and their aftermaths
(strong stellar winds and supernova explosions) are held responsible
for their formation. This picture, however, is not without its critics
and other mechanism such as the infall of high velocity clouds,
turbulent motions or even Gamma Ray Bursters have recently been
proposed.

A promising region that sheds light on the processes which lie at
origin of the HI holes is the recently discovered supergiant shell in
IC\,2574 (IC\,2574--SGS). Here, a multi--wavelength study (optical
broad and narrow band, HI, radio continuum and X--ray) provides
evidence that a young stellar cluster is driving the expansion of this
particular HI shell. IC\,2574--SGS measures roughly $1000 \times 500$
pc in size and is expanding at about 25~km\,s$^{-1}$.  The HI data
suggest an age of about $1.4 \times 10^7$ yr; the energy input must
have been of order $(2.6\,\pm\,1) \times 10^{53}$ ergs.  Massive star
forming regions, as traced by H$\alpha$ emission, are situated
predominantly on the rim of this HI shell. This supports the view that
the accumulated HI on the rim has reached densities which are high
enough for secondary star formation to commence.  VLA radio continuum
observations at $\lambda$\,6~cm show that these star-forming regions
are the main sources of radio continuum emission in this galaxy. This
emission is mainly thermal in origin.  Soft X--ray emission coming
from inside the HI shell is believed to be generated by an X--ray
emitting plasma ($\rm L_X(0.1-2.4\,\rm
keV)\,=\,(1.6\,\pm\,0.5)\times10^{38}$\,ergs\,s$^{-1}$). The X--ray
data are compatible with emission coming from a Raymond \& Smith
plasma at a temperature of about log(T)[K]=6.8 and a density of
0.03~cm$^{-3}$.

Deep R--band observations reveal the presence of an interior stellar
cluster in IC\,2574--SGS. It is believed to be the powering source for
the formation and expansion of the HI shell as well as for the heating
of the X--ray gas. These observations support the standard picture
that at least some HI holes that are found in the ISM of galaxies are
created as a result of massive star formation and the subsequent rapid
evolution of the most massive stars.

We consider global HI and optical properties of about three hundred
nearby galaxies with V$_0 < 500$ km/s. The majority of them have
individual photometric distance estimates. The galaxy sample
parameters show some known and some new correlations implying a
meaningful dynamic explanation: 1) In the whole range of diameters, 1
--- 40 Kpc, the galaxy standard diameter and rotational velocity
follows a nearly linear Tully-Fisher relation, $\lg
A_{25}\propto(0.99\pm0.06)\lg V_m.$\hspace{0.2cm} 2) The HI
mass-to-luminosity ratio and the HI mass-to-"total" mass (inside the
standard optical diameter) ratio increase systematically from giant
galaxies towards dwarfs, reaching maximum values $5
M_{\odot}/L_{\odot}$ and 3, respectively. 3) For all the Local Volume
galaxies their total mass-to- luminosity ratio lies within a range of
[0.2--16] $M_{\odot}/L_{\odot}$ with a median of $3.0
M_{\odot}/L_{\odot}$. The $M_{25}/L$ ratio decreases slightly from
giant towards dwarf galaxies. 4) The $M_{HI}/L$ and $M_{25}/L$ ratios
for the sample galaxies correlate with their mean optical surface
brightness, which may be caused by star formation activity in the
galaxies.  5) The $M_{HI}/L$ and $M_{25}/L$ ratios are practically
independent of the local mass density of surrounding galaxies within
the range of densities of about six orders of magnitude. 6) For the LV
galaxies their HI mass and angular momentum follow a nearly linear
relation: $\lg M_{HI}\propto(0.99\pm0.04)\lg(V_m\cdot A_{25})$,
expected for rotating gaseous disks being near the threshold of
gravitational instability, favourable for active star formation.  \par

We present high-quality spectroscopic observations of the two
most-metal deficient blue compact galaxies known, I Zw 18 and SBS
0335--052. We use the data to determine the heavy element and helium
abundances.  The oxygen abundances in the NW and the SE components of
I Zw 18 are found to be the same within the errors, 7.17$\pm$0.03 and
7.18$\pm$0.03 respectively, although marginally statistically
significant spatial variations of oxygen abundance might be
present. In contrast, we find a statistically significant gradient of
oxygen abundance in SBS 0335--052. The largest oxygen abundance, 12 +
log O/H = 7.338$\pm$0.012, is found in the region 0.6$''$ to the NE of
the brightest part of the galaxy, and it decreases toward the SW to
values of $\sim$ 7.2, comparable to that in I Zw 18.  The underlying
stellar absorption strongly influences the observed intensities of He
I emission lines in the brightest NW component of I Zw 18, and hence
this component {\it should not be used} for primordial He abundance
determination.  The effect of underlying stellar absorption, though
present, is much smaller in the SE component.  The He mass fraction
$Y$ = 0.243$\pm$0.007 derived in this component is in excellent
agreement with recent measurements by Izotov \& Thuan, suggesting the
robustness of the technique applied in measurements of the helium
abundance in low-metallicity blue compact galaxies.

The high signal-to-noise ratio spectrum ($\geq$ 100 in the continuum)
of SBS 0335--052 allows us to measure the helium mass fraction with a
precision better than 2\% -- 5\% in nine different regions along the
slit.  We show that, while underlying stellar absorption in SBS
0335--052 is important only for the He I $\lambda$4471 emission line,
other mechanisms such as collisional and fluorescent enhancements are
influencing the intensities of all He I emission lines and should be
properly taken into account. When the electron number density derived
from [S II] emission lines is used in SBS 0335--052, the correction of
He I emission lines for collisional enhancement leads to
systematically different He mass fractions for different He I emission
lines. This {\it unphysical} result implies that the use of the
electron number density derived from [S II] emission lines, being
characteristic of the S$^+$ zone, but not of the He$^+$ zone, will
lead to an {\it incorrect} inferred value of $Y$. In the case of SBS
0335--052 it leads to a significant underestimate of the He mass
fraction. In contrast, the self-consistent method using the five
strongest He I emission lines in the optical spectrum for correction
for collisional and fluorescent enhancements shows excellent agreement
of the He mass fraction derived from the He I $\lambda$5876 and He I
$\lambda$6678 emission lines in all 9 regions of SBS 0335--052 used
for the He abundance determination.

The weighted mean He mass fraction in SBS 0335--052 is $Y$ =
0.2437$\pm$0.0014 when the three He I $\lambda$4471, $\lambda$5876 and
$\lambda$6678 emission lines are used, and is 0.2463$\pm$0.0015 when
the He I $\lambda$4471 emission line is excluded. These values are in
very good agreement with recent measurements of the He mass fraction
in SBS 0335--052 by Izotov and coworkers. The weighted mean helium
mass fraction in the two most metal-deficient BCGs I Zw 18 and SBS
0335--052, $Y$=0.2462$\pm$0.0015, after correction for the stellar He
production results in a primordial He mass fraction $Y_p$ =
0.2452$\pm$0.0015. The derived $Y_p$ leads to a baryon-to-photon ratio
of (4.7$^{+1.0}_{-0.8}$)$\times$10$^{-10}$ and to a baryon mass
fraction in the Universe $\Omega_b$$h^2_{50}$ =
0.068$^{+0.015}_{-0.012}$, consistent with the values derived from the
primordial D and $^7$Li abundances, and supporting the standard big
bang nucleosynthesis theory. For the most consistent set of primordial
D, $^4$He, and $^7$Li abundances we derive an equivalent number of
light neutrino species $N_\nu$ = 3.0$\pm$0.3 (2$\sigma$).

Utilizing the F814W and F300W filters, Hubble Space Telescope Wide
Field Planetary Camera-2 (WFPC2) images were taken of three low
surface brightness dwarf elliptical galaxies in the Virgo cluster.
The intent of the observations was to determine the small scale
structure in these enigmatic galaxies, and to attempt to learn
something about the nature of their giant branch through the detection
of luminosity fluctuations.  In two of the three studied galaxies,
V7L3 and V1L4, the luminosity fluctuations in the inner, constant
surface brightness regions were unambiguously detected.  At the
nominal distance of the Virgo cluster, the measured luminosity
fluctuations in the F814W band yields a density of 2 -- 10 red
giants/pixel. In the most extreme of these two cases, V7L3, we derive
a surface density of giant stars of $\sim$ 3 per 10 pc$^2$.  Using the
observed $B-V$ and $V-I$ colors as a constraint, we could find no
model that would reproduce the observed fluctuation signal and blue
colors if there was a significant population of M-giants in these
systems. Overall, our results are consistent with a mean spectral type
of K0 -- K2 which implies a relatively metal poor population.  The
third system, V2L8, did not have a detectable fluctuation signal which
possibly implies it is not in the Virgo cluster. Interestingly, this
system is highly nucleated.  Our observations have resolved this
nucleus and if V2L8 is in Virgo, then we have discovered what is
likely the smallest bulge measured to date, having an effective radius
of only 50 pc.  This bulge is quite red (as red as giant ellipticals)
and its entirely possible that this nucleated dE galaxy, in fact, is a
very large galaxy located in the background.  As such, it is highly
reminiscent of the manner in which Malin-1 was discovered.  Optical
spectroscopy of this nucleus is required to confirm this.  Finally, we
find no evidence for small scale clumping of stars in any of the
studied systems at this much improved spatial resolution. This implies
these systems are dynamically well-relaxed and that the physical cause
of their observed low surface brightnesses is their low density.  When
imaged at the high spatial resolution of the WFPC2 ($\sim$ 6 pc per
pixel), the galaxies are easy to look right through without evening
knowing they are present in the very middle of the WFPC2 frame.  They
appear only as elevated ``sky noise''.

Using observations from the {\it Hubble Space Telescope} archive,
color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) have been constructed for globular
cluster 4 in the Fornax dSph galaxy and its surrounding field.  These
diagrams extend below the main-sequence turnoffs and have yielded
measurements of the ages of the populations.

The most prominent features of the CMD of the Fornax field population
are a heavily populated red clump of horizontal branch (HB) stars, a
broad red giant branch (RGB), and a main sequence that spans a large
range in luminosity.  In this CMD, there are very few stars at the
positions of the HBs of the five globular clusters in Fornax, which
suggests that only a very small fraction of the field population
resembles the clusters in age and chemical composition.  The large
span in luminosity of the main-sequence suggests that star formation
began in the field $\simeq$12 Gyrs ago and continued to $\simeq$0.5
Gyr ago.  There are separate subgiant branches in the CMD, which
indicate that the star formation was not continuous but occurred in
bursts.

The CMD of cluster 4 has a steep RGB, from which we estimate
[Fe/H]$\simeq$--2.0.  This is considerably lower than estimates from
the integrated light of the cluster, and the origins of this
discrepancy are discussed.  Cluster 4 has a very red HB, and is
therefore a prime example of the second parameter effect.  Comparisons
of cluster 4 with the other Fornax clusters and with M68, a very metal
poor globular cluster of the galactic halo, reveal that cluster 4 is
$\simeq$3 Gyrs younger than these other clusters which have much bluer
HBs.  This age difference is consistent with the prediction that age
is the 2$^{nd}$ parameter to within the uncertainties.  

The CMD of cluster 4 is virtually identical to that of the unusual
globular cluster of the galactic halo, Ruprecht 106, which suggests
that they have very similar ages and chemical compositions.  We discuss
the
possibility that cluster 4 also resembles R106 in having a larger [Fe/H]
than is indicated by its steep RGB and also a lower [$\alpha$/Fe]
ratio than is usual for a globular cluster, as indicated by some recent
observations of R106.

The CMDs of the five Fornax clusters indicate that cluster age is a
major but probably not the sole 2$^{nd}$ parameter.  Buonanno {\it et
al.} (1998a) concluded that cluster density probably influenced
the HB morphologies of clusters 1, 2, 3, and 5.  Despite a
very large difference in central density, the HBs of cluster 4 and
R106 are very similar.  This suggests that density may act as a
2$^{nd}$ parameter in clusters which have HBs on the verge
of moving towards the blue or
already blue for another
reason, such as very old age.

Observations of 39 nearby, mostly dwarf galaxies are presented.  The
observations were carried out at the 1.2-m telescope of Observatoire
de Haute-Provence (France) with B,V and I Cousins filters. Based on
surface and integrated photometry of the obtained images we derived
total B,V and I magnitudes and integrated B--V, V--I colours as well
as radii and magnitudes at the 25$^m$ isophotal level.

Azimuthally averaged surface brightness profiles were derived for 33
galaxies in each photometric band. Most of the profiles can be well
fitted by an exponential intensity law of brightness distribution. The
best-fitting exponential parameters are also given for the galaxies.

  Color-magnitude diagrams from deep, wide-field CCD photometry of the
Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy reveal that the red horizonal branch
(RHB) stars are strongly concentrated towards the center of the galaxy
relative to the dominant old population in Sculptor, confirming an
earlier claim of such a gradient (Da Costa et al. 1996). Since we find
no radial gradients of the age or metallicity distribution within
Sculptor, neither age nor metallicity can individually account for the
internal `second parameter' problem observed within the galaxy.  We
have also identified an unusual `spur' of stars that extends from the
main sequence turnoff region and located between the canonical blue
straggler region and the subgiant branch. These stars are also more
centrally concentrated than the oldest stars in Sculptor, although not
as extremely as the RHB stars.  Unable to convincingly interpret the
spur either as an unusual young population or as a foreground
population of stars, we conclude that binary stars offer the most
reasonable explanation for the origin of the spur that is also
consistent with other features in the CMD of Sculptor. We infer that
30--60\% of all apparently single stars in the inner region of Sculptor
may be binaries. We speculate that the possible radial gradient in the
binary-star population may be related to the variation of the HB
morphology in Sculptor.

  The first results are presented of a four-year program dedicated to
the CCD observations of Cepheids in the nearby galaxy IC 1613. Since
the program was carried out with a relatively small telescope, the
Dutch 0.9 m at ESO-La Silla, the observations were performed without
filter (white light), or Wh-band; the advantage of this technique is
that the photon statistics correspond to that of V-band observations
made with larger telescopes than 2 m and similar exposure time. The
effective wavelength of the Wh-band is intermediate between that of V
and R bands for stars of A-G spectral type, for back-illuminated CCD
detectors.  The analysis of the observations of Field A revealed the
presence of about 110 variable stars. The detected population I
Cepheids are 43; 9 Cepheids were already known from previous works,
while most of the new stars have a short period P. For stars with P$ >
5$ d and sufficient phase coverage it is possible to perform good
Fourier decomposition of light curves with resulting standard
deviation of the fit of 0.02 - 0.04 mag. There are several Cepheids
with relatively small amplitude, and most of them are first overtone
mode pulsators; the faintest detected Cepheids have V about 23 and P
about 1 day. At least 5 population II Cepheids and 8 eclipsing
binaries have been observed. The other variable stars are probable
long period, semiregular and irregular variables. A comparison with
results of other massive CCD photometric projects dedicated to the
detection of variable stars shows some advantages of the observations
in white light for fully exploiting the capabilities of relatively
small telescopes. A suggestion is made on how to use these results for
distance determinations.

We have obtained spectra for 50 candidate red giants in Andromeda II,
a dwarf spheroidal companion of M31, using the Low Resolution Imaging
Spectrometer on the Keck II telescope.  After eliminating background
galaxies and Galactic foreground stars, we are left with a sample of
42 red giants for which membership in Andromeda II can be established
unambiguously from radial velocities.  Line indices measured on the
Lick/IDS system are combined with $VI$ photometry obtained with the
Keck II and Palomar 5m telescopes to investigate the age and
metallicity distribution of these stars.  Based on a comparison of the
measured line indices to those of Lick/IDS standard stars in globular
and open clusters, we derive a mean metallicity of ${\overline{\rm
[Fe/H]}} = -1.47\pm0.19$ dex.  This confirms earlier conclusions based
on Thuan-Gunn $gr$ photometry that Andromeda II obeys the familiar
relation between mean stellar metallicity and galaxy luminosity. There
is also evidence for a dispersion in metallicity of $\sigma$([Fe/H]) =
$0.35\pm0.10$ dex based on the scatter in the measured Mg$b$ line
indices and the observed width of the galaxy's giant branch. We note
that while existing observations of Local Group dwarf galaxies
indicate that their mean metallicity depends rather sensitively on
total luminosity, the internal {\sl spread} in metallicity appears to
be relatively independent of galaxy luminosity.

Our spectroscopic sample contains one carbon star. We measure $M_I
\simeq -3.8$ for this star, which places it below the tip of the red
giant branch and suggests a common origin with the CH stars found in
the Galactic halo. Although this carbon star alone does not provide
evidence of an intermediate-age component in Andromeda II, two other
stars in our spectroscopic sample have $M_I \simeq -4.7$ and $-4.5$.
Membership in Andromeda II is unambiguous in both cases, indicating
that these stars fall along an extended asymptotic giant branch and
pointing to the presence of a modest intermediate-age population in
this galaxy.

The High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer on the Keck I telescope has
been used to measure nine radial velocities having a median precision
of $\simeq$ 2 km s$^{-1}$ for seven red giants belonging to the
isolated dwarf spheroidal galaxy Andromeda II.  We find a weighted
mean radial velocity of ${\overline{v}}_r$ = --188$\pm$3 km s$^{-1}$
and a central velocity dispersion of $\sigma_0 = 9.3^{+2.7}_{-2.6}$ km
s$^{-1}$.  There may be evidence for a radial velocity gradient across
the face of the galaxy, although the significance of this result is
low due to the small number of stars having measured velocities. Our
best estimate for the global mass-to-light ratio of Andromeda II is
$M/L_V = 20.9^{+13.9}_{-10.1}M_{\odot}/L_{V,{\odot}}$.  This value is
similar to those of several Galactic dwarf spheroidal galaxies and is
consistent with the presence of a massive dark halo in Andromeda II.

We study, through 2D hydrodynamical simulations, the feedback of a
starburst on the ISM of typical gas rich dwarf galaxies.  The main
goal is to address the circulation of the ISM and metals following the
starburst.  We assume a single-phase rotating ISM in equilibrium in
the galactic potential generated by a stellar disk and a spherical
dark halo.  The starburst is assumed to occur in a small volume in the
center of the galaxy, and it generates a mechanical power of $3.8
\times 10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$ or $3.8 \times 10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$ for
30 Myr.  We found, consistently with previous investigations, that the
galactic wind is not very effective in removing the ISM. The metal
rich stellar ejecta, instead, may be efficiently expelled from the
galaxy and dispersed in the intergalactic medium.

Moreover, we found that the central region of the galaxy is always
replenished with cold and dense gas after a few 100 Myr from the
starbust, achieving the requisite for a new star formation event in
$\approx 0.5 - 1$ Gyr. The hydrodynamical evolution of galactic winds
is thus consistent with the episodic star formation regime suggested
by many chemical evolution studies.

We also discuss the X-ray emission of these galaxies and find that the
observable (emission averaged) abundance of the hot gas underestimates
the real one if thermal conduction is effective.  This could explain
the very low hot gas metallicities estimated in starburst galaxies.

Dwarf galaxies are dominated by dark matter even in the innermost
regions and, therefore, provide excellent probes for the investigation
of dark halos.  To that purpose, we analyse ROSAT PSPC-data of the
dwarf galaxy NGC\,247. We focus in particular on the diffuse X-ray
emission in the $1/4\,$keV band.  Assuming an isothermal density
profile, we find that the mass of the hot emitting gas is about
$10^8\,{\rm M_{\odot}}$, corresponding to $\sim 0.5\%$ of the total
dynamical mass of the galaxy.  The total mass of NGC\,247, as derived
from the X-ray data agrees quite well with the value obtained from the
measured rotation curve (Burlak, Astronomy Reports 40, 621, 1996).

The X-ray profile in the $3/4\,$keV and $1.5\,$keV band shows an
excess at a radial distance of about $15\,$ arcmin from the
center. Such a ``hump'' in the radial X-ray profile can be explained
by the presence of a cluster of young low mass stars or brown
dwarfs. Therefore, NGC\,247 offers the possibility to observe the
formation of a halo of MACHOs.

As part of the Selected Areas Starcount Survey (SASS), a CCD survey to
$V>21$, we have obtained $VI$ photometry of two fields at $b=\pm
40^{\circ}$ aligned roughly with an extrapolation of the major axis of
the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf spheroidal galaxy.  Comparison of the
color-magnitude diagram (CMD) for some of these fields to the CMDs of
fields reflected about the Galactic $l=0^{\circ}$ meridian reveals an
excess of stars at $V_o=17.85$ and $0.9 < (V-I)_o < 1.1$ in the $(l,b)
= (11^{\circ},-40^{\circ})$ field.  The excess stars have colors
consistent with the Sgr red clump, and deeper CMD imaging in these
locations shows evidence of a main-sequence turnoff at $V=21$ with the
main-sequence extending to the limit of our data ($V=24$).  The
surface brightnesses we derive from either the potential excess of red
clump stars or the apparent excess of MSTO stars are consistent with
each other and with the results of other surveys at this latitude.  No
similar excess appears in our northern Galactic hemisphere fields near
$l=353^{\circ}, b=+41^{\circ}$ field.

We have obtained spectroscopy of all 30 candidate red clump stars in
the range $0.9 < (V-I)_o < 1.1$ and $ 17.75 < V_o < 17.95 $.  The
radial velocity distribution of the stars, while dissimilar from
expectations of Galactic structure models, does not show a
contribution by stars near the Galactocentric radial velocity seen in
other studies near the Sgr core.  It is difficult to reconcile a
photometric result that is consistent with other explorations of the
Sagittarius stream with a radial velocity distribution that is
apparently inconsistent.  In a companion paper (Johnston et al. 1999),
we discuss how some of the discrepancies are resolved if {\it our}
potential Sgr detection corresponds to a {\it different} Sgr tidal
streamer than that detected by most other surveys.

We present a comparison of semi-analytic models of the phase-space
structure of tidal debris with measurements of average distances,
velocities and surface densities of stars associated with the
Sagittarius dwarf galaxy (Sgr), compiled from all observations
reported since its discovery in 1994.

We find that several interesting features in the data can be explained
by these models.  The properties of stars $\sim \pm 10-15^o$ away from
the center of Sgr --- in particular, the orientation of material
perpendicular to Sgr's orbit (Alard 1996, Mateo et al 1996, Fahlman et
al 1996, Alcock et al 1997) and the kink in the velocity gradient
(Ibata et al 1997) --- are consistent with those expected for unbound
material stripped during the most recent pericentric passage $\sim
50$Myrs ago.  The break in the slope of the surface density seen by
Mateo, Olszewski \& Morrison (1998) at $b\sim -35^o$ can be understood
as marking the end of this material.  However, the detections beyond
this point are unlikely to represent debris in a trailing streamer,
torn from Sgr during the immediately preceding passage $\sim 0.7$Gyrs
ago, as the surface-density of this streamer would be too low compared
to observations in these regions.  The low $b$ detections are more
plausibly explained by a leading streamer of material that was lost
more that 1 Gyr ago and has wrapped all the way around the Galaxy to
intercept the line of sight.  The distance and velocity measurements
at $b=-40^o$ reported in Majewski et al (1999) also support this
hypothesis.

We determine debris models with these properties on orbits that are
consistent with the currently known positions and velocities of Sgr in
Galactic potentials with halo components that have circular velocities
$v_{\rm circ}=140-200$ km/s.  In all cases, the orbits oscillate
between $\sim$12 kpc and $\sim$40 kpc from the Galactic center with
radial time periods of $0.55-0.75$Gyrs.  The best match to the data is
obtained in models where Sgr currently has a mass of $\sim 10^9
M_{\odot}$ and has orbited the Galaxy for at least the last 1 Gyr,
during which time it has reduced its mass by a factor of 2-3, or
luminosity by an amount equivalent to $\sim 10\%$ of the total
luminosity of the Galactic halo.  These numbers suggest that Sgr is
rapidly disrupting and unlikely to survive beyond a few more
pericentric passages.  These conclusions are only tentative because
they rely heavily on the less-certain measurements of debris
properties far from the center of Sgr.  However, they demonstrate the
immense potential for using debris to determine Sgr's dynamical
history in great detail.

We have commenced a 21-cm survey of the entire southern sky
($\delta<0^\circ$, $-1200$ kms$^{-1}$ $<v_{\odot}<12,700$ kms$^{-1}$)
which is ``blind'', i.e. unbiased by previous optical information.  In
the present paper we report on the results of a pilot project which is
based on data from this all-sky survey. The project was carried out on
an area of 600 square degrees centred on the nearby Centaurus A
(Cen\,A) group of galaxies at a mean velocity of $v_{\odot}\sim$ 500
kms$^{-1}$. This was recently the subject of a separate and thorough
optical survey.

We found 10 new group members to add to 21 galaxies already known in
the Cen\,A group: five of these are previously uncatalogued galaxies,
while five were previously catalogued but not known to be associated
with the group.  Most of the new members have H{\sc i} masses close to
our survey limit of 10$^{7}$ M$_{\odot}$ at the assumed group distance
of 3.5 Mpc.  The new detection with the largest H{\sc i} mass is
ESO174-G001 with $M_{H{\sc i}}=2.1\times 10^{8}$ M$_{\odot}$.  Prior
to our survey this galaxy was an uncertain optical identification
because of high galactic extinction.  We found optical counterparts
for all the H{\sc i} detections, most of them intrinsically very faint
(M$_{B}>-13.0$) low-surface brightness dwarf galaxies with H{\sc i}
profile line-widths suggestive of dynamics dominated by dark
matter. The new group members add approximately 6\% to the H{\sc i}
mass of the group, and 4\% to its light. The H{\sc i} mass function,
derived from all the known group galaxies in the interval $10^{7}$
M$_{\odot}< M_{\rm H{\sc i}}< 10^{9}$ M$_{\odot}$, has a faint-end
slope of 1.30 $\pm$ 0.15, allowing us to rule out a slope of 1.7 at
95\% confidence.  Even if the number in the lowest mass bin is
increased by 50\% the slope only increases to 1.45 $\pm$ 0.15.

  Possible orbital histories of the Sgr dwarf galaxy are explored. A
special-purpose N-body code is used to construct the first models of
the Milky Way - Sgr Dwarf system in which both the Milky Way and the
Sgr Dwarf are represented by full N-body systems and followed for a
Hubble time. These models are used to calibrate a semi-analytic model
of the Dwarf's orbit that enable us to explore a wider parameter space
than is accessible to the N-body models. We conclude that the extant
data on the Dwarf are compatible with a wide range of orbital
histories. At one extreme the Dwarf initially possesses 10$^{11}$
\Msun\ and starts from a Galactocentric distance 200 kpc. At the
other extreme the Dwarf starts with 10$^9$ \Msun\ and
Galactocentric distance 60 kpc, similar to its present apocentric
distance. In all cases the Dwarf is initially dark-matter dominated
and the current velocity dispersion of the Dwarf's dark matter is
tightly constrained to be 21 km\,s$^{-1}$. This number is probably
compatible with the smaller measured dispersion of the Dwarf's stars
because of (a) the dynamical difference between dark and luminous
matter, and (b) velocity anisotropy.

We present CO 1$\rightarrow$0 and 2$\rightarrow$1 observations of the
dwarf starburst galaxy NGC~1569 with the IRAM interferometer on
Plateau de Bure.  We find the CO emission is not spatially associated
with the two super star clusters in the galaxy, but rather is found in
the vicinity of an HII region.  With the resolution of our data, we
can resolve the CO emission into five distinct giant molecular clouds,
four are detected at both transitions.  In the 1$\rightarrow$0
transition the sizes and linewidths are similar to those of GMCs in
the Milky Way Galaxy and other nearby systems, with diameters ranging
from $\sim$ 40 to 50 pc and linewidths from 4 to 9 km/s. The
(2-1)/(1-0) line ratios range from 0.64 $\pm$ 0.30 to 1.31 $\pm$ 0.60
in the different clouds. The lower line ratios are similar to those
seen in typical Galactic GMCs, while values higher than unity are
often seen in interacting or starburst galaxies. We use the virial
theorem to derive the CO-H$_2$ conversion factor for three of the
clouds, and we adopt an average value of 6.6 $\pm$ 1.5 times the
Galactic conversion factor for NGC~1569 in general.  We discuss the
role of the molecular gas in NGC~1569, and its relationship to the hot
component of the ISM.  Finally, we compare our observations with blue
compact dwarf galaxies which have been mapped in CO.

of galaxies and of Draco A. The actual number of (probable) members of
this group increases to 19 galaxies. Its velocity dispersion is 87
km/s.  With a distance of $2.2\pm0.5$ Mpc this group is the nearest to
the Local Group and might have considerable dynamical influence on the
Local Group.

We are engaged in several projects that use the Hubble Space Telescope
(HST) to resolve nearby Blue Compact Dwarf (BCD) galaxies into
individual stars. A stellar census provides the most direct
constraints on the formation ages of BCDs, and a record of the
star-formation history (SFH). Studies conducted include VII~Zw~403,
I~Zw~36, Mkr~178, and I~Zw~18, which cover the range of low
metallicities typical of the ionized gas of BCDs. In I~Zw~18 (the most
distant object resolved), stars with ages $\simeq$~1~Gyr are detected;
in the others, the data give evidence of stars that are at a minimum
1-2~Gyr old (I~Zw~36 and Mkr~178) and possibly older, or truly ancient
with ages exceeding 10~Gyr (VII~Zw~403). We find that BCDs are not
primeval galaxies.

Some fine structures can nowadays be identified in the high-quality
colour-magnitude diagrams (CMD) of Local Group galaxies.  The clump of
red giants, for instance, may present a significant colour spread, and
extensions to both brighter and fainter luminosities. Such features
are predicted by population synthesis models which consider stars in
the complete relevant ranges of ages and metallicities, and are
potentially useful for constraining the star formation histories of
the parent galaxies over scales of gigayears. We briefly comment the
cases of fields in the Magellanic Clouds, M31, and the local CMD from
{\em Hipparcos}.

Several N-body methods were combined in order to develop a method for
the determination of the parameters of interacting galaxies. This
method has been applied to the HI distribution of NGC4449.  In a first
step the fast restricted N-body models were used to confine a region
in parameter space reproducing the main observational features. In a
second step a genetic algorithm is introduced which allows for an
automated search in the high-dimensional parameter space as well as
for a uniqueness test of special parameter sets. Using artificial data
I show that the genetic algorithm reliably recovers orbital
parameters, provided that the data are sufficiently accurate, i.e.\
all the key features are included.  In the third step the results of
the restricted N-body models are compared with detailed
self--consistent N-body simulations.  In the case of NGC4449 the
applicability of the simple restricted N-body calculations is
demonstrated. Additionally, it is shown that the HI gas can be modeled
here without any restrictions by a purely stellar dynamical approach.

   NGC4449 is an active star--forming dwarf galaxy of Magellanic type.
{}From radio observations van Woerden et al.\ (1975) found an extended
HI--halo around NGC4449 which is at least a factor of 10 larger than
the optical diameter $D_{\rm 25} \approx 5.6$ kpc. More recently,
Bajaja et al. (1994) and Hunter et al.\ (1998) discerned details in
the HI--halo: a disc--like feature around the center of NGC4449 and a
lopsided arm structure. In a series of simulations it is demonstrated
that the main features can be obtained by a gravitational interaction
between NGC4449 and another nearby dwarf galaxy, DDO125. According to
these calculations the closest approach between both galaxies happened
$\sim 3.5 \cdot 10^{8}$ yr ago at a minimum distance of $\sim 25$ kpc
on a nearly parabolic orbit. In case of an encounter scenario, the
dynamical mass of DDO125 should not be smaller than 10\% of NGC4449's
mass. Before the encounter the observed HI was arranged in a disc with
a radius of 35--40 kpc around the center of NGC4449 which had the same
orientation as the central ellipsoidal HI structure.  The origin of
this disc is still unclear, but it might be caused by a previous
interaction.

Whereas it is well known that gas may be driven into the core of
merging disks, fueling a central AGN or a nuclear starburst, recent
studies have shown that a significant fraction of the stellar/gaseous
components is expelled into the intergalactic medium along tidal
tails. The tidal debris might be dispersed in the
intergalactic/intracluster medium where it adds to the diffuse
background light such as that observed in the Coma cluster, might fall
back towards the merger, or regroup to form a new generation of
galaxies, the so-called tidal dwarf galaxies (TDGs). We illustrate in
this paper these various phenomena with a detailed multi-wavelength
study of the interacting system NGC 2992/3 (Arp 245).

The power of high quality imaging combined with the large collecting area of
each VLT telescope is impressive, and there are clearly many exciting
discoveries waiting to be made. The study of resolved stellar populations will
certainly benefit greatly from this new observatory, as with Palomar before. We
will now be able to probe a much large range of star forming environment within
the Local Group, and specifically very low metallicity regions in nearby dwarf
irregular galaxies. The study of individual stars and star-formation regions in
the nearby universe is the only way we will understand the observations of
galaxy populations at high redshift. We present some initial results from the
BVI imaging of the Local Group galaxy Antlia made during FORS1 science
verification in January 1999.

A multi-band analysis of the region containing the supergiant HI shell
in dwarf galaxy IC2574 presents convincing evidence of a causal
relationship between central star cluster, HI hole, and secondary star
formation sites.  Comparisons of the far-UV (1521 \AA), H$\alpha$,
X-ray, and HI morphologies suggest that the region is in an auspicious
moment of triggered star formation. The derived properties of the HI
shell and the star forming region support this scenario. The kinematic
age of the HI shell is in agreement with the age of the central
stellar cluster, as derived independently using far-UV
observations. An estimate for the mechanical energy input from
supernovae and stellar winds of the central stellar cluster made from
far-UV photometry and the derived cluster age is a few times higher
than the kinetic energy of the HI shell. The requisite energy input
needed to create the HI shell, derived from the HI observations and
the numerical models of Chevalier, is on the order of four times
higher than the estimated energy input. Given the overwhelming
observational evidence that the central cluster is responsible for the
expanding HI shell, this discrepancy suggests that the required energy
input, derived from the HI observations using this classical method,
is overestimated.
