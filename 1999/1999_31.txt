Session 1:  Colloquium (9:30 - 10:30 am)

            SPEAKER: Pre-Dr. Eugene Chiang 
                     (CalTech)
	    TITLE:   "Circumstellar T Tauri Disks: 
	              Structure, Spectra, and Stability"
	    ABSTRACT: 
Excess infrared (IR) emission from T Tauri stars arises
from circumstellar disks. Passive disks are the simplest to
consider. They lack intrinsic luminosity and reradiate the energy
they absorb from the central star. I will discuss the structure
of passive disks in hydrostatic and radiative equilibrium. Two
regions are distinguished: the superthermal surface layer which
is directly exposed to starlight, and the cooler, diffusively heated
interior which the surface encases. For face-on disks, our
computations of spectral energy distributions (SEDs) agree with
observations of flat class II sources. Spectral features from
dust grains in the superheated layer appear in emission. For
edge-on disks, the SED is that of a class I source. Solid-state
spectral features appear in absorption. I will conclude by
discussing recent attempts to determine the stability of the passive disk.



Session 2:  Colloquium (10:45 - 11:45 am)

            SPEAKER: Pre-Dr. Eugene Chiang 
                     (CalTech)
	    TITLE:   "Keck Pencil-Beam Survey for Faint Kuiper Belt Objects"
	    ABSTRACT:
The present-day Kuiper Belt observed out to 50 AU appears
depleted in mass by up to 2 orders of magnitude compared to
primordial values. The cause of depletion is unknown, but is
thought to be Neptune, whose gravity ejects Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs)
out of the Belt and might grind objects into dust. Neptune's destructive
influence should extend only out to 48 AU, the location of its
outermost 2:1 resonance. Beyond this radius, the mass of the Kuiper
Belt has been speculated to rise back to primordial values.
	Currently nothing is known observationally about the Belt
beyond 50 AU. I will describe our pilot survey using the Keck 10-m
telescope. We do not detect any objects beyond 50 AU. We do detect
two new objects inside 50 AU having probable diameters of 50 km, one
of which is the faintest observed to date at visual magnitude 27.2.
I will present the KBO luminosity function from $m_R$ = 20 to 27,
and discuss its implications on size, mass, and distance distributions.
