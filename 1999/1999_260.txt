Subject: SCIENCE OBSERVATIONS DURING ORBITAL VERIFICATION

Dear colleagues:
        During the forthcoming HST servicing mission , SM3A ,which is
currently scheduled for December 11 , we will carry out  a
recommissioning program of the HST observatory   called Servicing
Mission Orbital Verification (SMOV) . During the early phases of this
program  the HST  will be restricted  to point away from the Earth  at a
region of space called the Bright Earth Avoidance region (BEA)  for
approximately 12  days . This procedure ensures we do not reduce
permanently the reflectivity  of the WFPC2 pickoff mirror, as UV light
reflected by the Earth's surface might polymerize contaminants
accumulated during the servicing mission and prevent their evaporation.
During that time the  WFPC2 will not be useable for scientific
observations and operations with the STIS  MAMAs will not be allowed for
safety reasons.  Normal science operations will  therefore not be
possible during that  period of time.
        However it is possible to  use the STIS CCD and the FGS to carry
out some observations during the BEA period and we have decided to craft
a science observing program to take advantage of this  restricted
observing  opportunity , on a non interference basis with the SMOV
activities.  The program, which is currently being finalized, will
consist of simple observations with the STIS CCD  which can be carried
out during  an orbit. As the location of the BEA on the sky changes
daily the  program has  to be flexible enough to allow for new targets
to be chosen  every time that there is a change of launch date or a
delay in the related SMOV activities .
        Furthermore we have approved a Director Discretionary Time
program, PI Nelan, to use the FGS  on a non interference basis  with the
SMOV activities, and with no proprietary time .
        The data from both of these programs will  become immediately
available . The details for both these sets of observations can be found
in http://www.stsci.edu/instruments/fgs/fgs_advisory.html and
http://www.stsci.edu/cgi-bin/stis?stisid=543 .
        We must emphasize that  while we will do our best to execute
part of the program, the targets  observed  and the actual amount of
data obtained will depend on the date of launch and  on the successful
execution of the scheduled SMOV activities  which will have priority at
all times.
        Immediately  after the end of these  observations we will  carry
out a few  Early Release Observations   to demonstrate the success of
the Servicing Mission   and we will  also resume the regular GO program.
We are  therefore requesting that potential users of the STIS  CCD  or
FGS  data do  not  use the data for Public Relations  purposes  until
the ERO data has been released  and  the related PR activities have
been  completed .
        Best regards
                        Duccio Macchetto
