            ==================================================
 
Session 1:  Colloquium (2:00 - 3:00 pm)
 
            SPEAKER: Dr. Jiang Ing-Guey
                     (ASIAA)
            TITLE:   "The Orbit and Mass of the Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy"
            
            ABSTRACT:
Possible orbital histories of the Sgr dwarf galaxy are explored.
A special-purpose N-body code is used to construct the first models of
the Milky Way -- Sgr Dwarf system in which both the Milky Way and the Sgr
Dwarf are represented by full N-body systems and followed for a Hubble
time. These models are used to calibrate a semi-analytic model of the
Dwarf's orbit that enable us to explore a wider parameter space than is
accessible to the N-body models. We conclude that the extant data on the
Dwarf are compatible with a wide range of orbital histories. 



 
Session 2:  Journal Club (3:15 - 4:15 pm)
 
            SPEAKER: Dr. Minho Choi
                     (ASIAA)
            TITLE:   "Detection of Polarized CO Emission from the 
                      Molecular Outflow in NGC 1333 IRAS 4A,"
                      1999, ApJL, 525, L109"
