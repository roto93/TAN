{\bf Main Scientific Results}

First determination of the maximum mass of the hot neutron star
$\sim 70 \,M_{\odot}$.
Suggetstion of the idea of the magnetorotational supernovae model,
numerical calculations of which had shown an few percent efficiency of
transformation of the rotational enegry into the energy of explosion,
what is enough for explanation of the energetics of II type SN.

Theory of the mass loss from massive evolved stars was developed, and
method for construction of self-consistent stellar models with mass loss
had been suggested. Some models had beed constructed numerically.

Prediction of the existence of the binary radiopulsars, going through
the stage of the X-ray sources (recycled pulsars). Now about 50 of such
objects are known, the first one, the Hulse-Taylor pulsar, was observed
1n 1975, about one year after its prediction.

Original results had been obtained in the theory of accretion into black holes
and neutron stars: formation of the accretion disc coronae; first indication
of accretion disc convective instabilities; self-consistent model of
accretion onto a rapidly roatting star.

Discovery of the nonequilibrium layer in the
envelopes of neutron stars, and creation of the cosmic gamma ray burst
models originated in the nearby neutron stars.

The main recent results are connected with obtaining of new solutions of
the equilibrium relativistic clusters and analysis of their stability;
developement of the theory of propagation of strong 2-D and 3-D shocks
in the interstellar medium in a thin layer approximation;
developement of accretion disc theory with advection in presence of
magnetic fields;
application of Galerkin method to the problems of stability and collapse
of relativistic objects;
stability of rotating supermassive stars in presence of a dark matter.
