>Abstract:
>
>Following suggestions by Kirk Borne and collaborators, Mark Dickinson,
>and Mel Ulmer, we will observe the cluster of galaxies Abell 2444, which
>lies within the Leonid avoidance viewing zone.  This cluster has a
>published redshift z=0.324, which is fairly high for an Abell cluster,
>although there are indications that the redshift might in fact be closer
>to 0.2, and has 76 members between m3 and m3+2 (m3 = mag of
>3rd-brightest member).  The cluster has distance class 6, richness class
>1, and Bautz-Morgan (BM) type III (Abell et al.  1989, ApJS, 70, 1).
>So, this is a relatively distant, poor cluster, with no single centrally
>dominant galaxy.  This may therefore be an unevolved cluster.  Such a
>conjecture is supported by Einstein IPC X-ray imaging observations of
>this cluster (Henry et al. 1982, ApJ, 262, 1; see also
>http://rings.gsfc.nasa.gov/~borne/ai2224s24.gif ) -- there is no
>evidence for the X-ray emission that would normally be expected for a
>rich evolved cluster.  This poor cluster may therefore be a young
>cluster in the process of formation through the hierarchical merging of
>subclumps out of the cosmological large-scale structure.
>
>We will observe the cluster in F606W and F814W, roughly corresponding
>to B and V at the nominal cluster redshift.  The brightest cluster
>member will be placed in the PC.  A two-point dither will be used,
>with two (F814W) and three (F606W) exposures at each dither point to
>provide robust CR rejection.  The program covers a total of five orbits,
>two used for F814W and three for F606W.
