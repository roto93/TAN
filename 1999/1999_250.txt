Session 1:  Colloquium (2:00 - 3:00 pm)
 
            SPEAKER: Dr. Zuhui Fan
                     (University of Chicago)
            TITLE:   "The Mass Function and the Linear Bias of 
                      Dark Matter Halos"
            
            ABSTRACT:
The universe is full of structures (galaxies, clusters of galaxies, 
and so forth). One important task in cosmology is to understand the 
formation of large-scale structures of the universe. In this talk, 
I will first describe the general picture of the structure formation, 
and then discuss the number density (i.e., the mass function) and the 
spatial distribution (i.e., the bias) of dark halos from two specific 
theoretical models. I will demonstrate that the results from these 
models do not fully agree with results of numerical simulations. In 
order to better model the formation of dark halos, one needs to find 
out the main physical processes responsible for the halo formation. 
I will present an analytical relation between the number density and 
the bias of dark matter halos, which holds true under several conditions 
that are satisfied by a broad class of relatively simple theoretical models. 
This relation can be readily examed by numerical simulations. 
If simulations do show such a relation exists, the halo formation can be 
modeled within the simple theoretical framework. If simulations 
disprove the relation, then more realistic physics should be taken 
into account for the structure formation. In other words, the validity of 
this relation can provide us important clues for the formation of dark 
matter halos. 



 
Session 2:  Colloquium (3:15 - 4:15 pm)
 
            SPEAKER: Prof. Phillip K. Lu
                     (Yale University)
            TITLE:   "Dark Matter: Local Volume Density vs Total Surface Density
                     (A Spectrophotometric and Kinematic Studies of the SGP)"
