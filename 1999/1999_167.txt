FIRST IMAGES FROM CHANDRA X-RAY OBSERVATORY TO BE RELEASED

Cambridge, MA.  August 23, 1999.  The spectacular first images from
the world's most powerful X-ray telescope, NASA's Chandra X-ray
Observatory, will be unveiled at a media briefing at 1 p.m. EDT,
Thursday, Aug. 26.  The briefing will be held in the James E. Webb
Auditorium at NASA Headquarters, 300 E St. SW, Washington,  DC.  A
stunning image of the remnant of an exploded star will be shown, along
with an image of a newly discovered cosmic x-ray jet.

The Chandra Observatory is operated by the Smithsonian Astrophysical
Observatory's Chandra X-ray Center in Cambridge.   Two Cambridge
scientists will be on the NASA panel: Dr. Harvey Tananbaum, Director of
the Chandra Center, and  Dr. Robert Kirshner, professor of astronomy at
Harvard University.  Other panelists will be Dr. Edward Weiler,
Associate Administrator for Space Science at NASA Headquarters in
Washington, DC; and Dr. Martin Weisskopf,  Chandra Project Scientist at
NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville,  AL.

The event will be carried live on NASA Television with
question-and-answer capability for reporters covering the  briefing from

participating NASA centers and from the Chandra Operations Center in
Cambridge.  NASA Television is available on transponder 9C, satellite
GE-2 at 85 degrees West longitude, vertical polarization, frequency 3880

MHz, audio of 6.8 MHz.

Chandra has been undergoing activation and checkout since it was placed
into orbit during Space Shuttle mission STS-93 in July. Chandra will
examine exploding stars, black holes, colliding galaxies and other
high-energy cosmic phenomena to help scientists gain a better
understanding of  the structure and evolution of the universe.

The first Chandra images will be available on August 26 at 1:00 p.m. EDT

at http://chandra.havard.edu

NOTE: To reserve a space at the interactive Q&A viewing at the Chandra
Operation Center in Cambridge, please contact Kathy Lestition at
