Associated Talk: March 2 (Tuesday) 9:30 ASIAA conference room

	Eugene Chiang, Astrophysics, Caltech'

    "Keck Pencil-Beam Survey for Faint Kuiper Belt Objects"
 
      The present-day Kuiper Belt observed out to 50 AU appears
depleted in mass by up to 2 orders of magnitude compared to
primordial values. The cause of depletion is unknown, but is
thought to be Neptune, whose gravity ejects Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs)
out of the Belt and might grind objects into dust. Neptune's destructive
influence should extend only out to 48 AU, the location of its
outermost 2:1 resonance. Beyond this radius, the mass of the Kuiper
Belt has been speculated to rise back to primordial values.

	Currently nothing is known observationally about the Belt
beyond 50 AU. I will describe our pilot survey using the Keck 10-m
telescope. We do not detect any objects beyond 50 AU. We do detect
two new objects inside 50 AU having probable diameters of 50 km, one
of which is the faintest observed to date at visual magnitude 27.2.
I will present the KBO luminosity function from R mag. = 20 to 27,
and discuss its implications on size, mass, and distance distributions.

           OUTLINE OF MAIN TALKS:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOHDAN PACZYNSKI, Princeton Univ.

(I) past, present and future of OGLE

I would like to present progress and obstacles to progress of one of the
massive variability searches, the Optical Gravitational Lensing  Experiment.
In phase I (galactic bulge observing seasons 1992-95) the pre-existing 1-m
Swope telescope at Las Campanas was used, with up to 80 nights per season
made available by the Carnegi Institution of Washington.  The pre-existing
thick CCD camera with 2k x 2k pixels (0.4" in the sky) was used.  In phase II
(beginning January 6, 1997) the dedicated 1.3-m telescope of the Warsaw
University Observatory is used, with a thin CCD camera with 2k x 2k pixels
(0.4" in the sky) making drift scan exposures of 2k x 8k fields in the galactic
bulge, LMC, SMC, and several targets of opportunity.  A mosaic camera made of 
8 thin CCDs with the total of 8k x 8k pixels (0.25" in the sky) will be built,
probably by the end of 2000, by Dr. Andrzej Udalski of the Warsaw University 
Observatory.  Image subtraction software, originally developed by C. Alard and
R. Lupton, will be incorporated in the data pipeline by Princeton graduate
student Przemek Wozniak.  The current real time detection rate of microlensing
events is about 45 per year.  With the new camera and software the expected
detection rate may increase by a factor up to 10.  All images are taken with
standard UBVI filters, with about 80% of them in I-band.  The most important
new result is the determination of the distance to the Magellanic Clouds,
which is `short', with M-m = 18.2.

I shall describe the advantages of using standard filters, and advantages and
practical problems which arise while making data public domain.  I shall present
(probably very incomplete) description of various plans (or wishes) to develop
much more powerful systems, with telescopes in 2-4 meter range.

 (II):  small and very small automated telescopes

I would like to describe some scientific goals as well as some technical
problems in developing very small instruments designed to monitor all sky
for variability.  Recent discovery of the GRB related optical transient 
by ROTSE is a spectacular example of the power of very small instruments.
Even smaller instruments may be required (at least initially) to monitor
all sky all the time, with (say) one minute exposures.

It seems that in all major survey projects software development is under-
appreciated at the initial planning stage.  I'll try to make case for
developing systems with a relatively small initial data rate, and gradual
upgrading, with the data rate increasing modestly (say by a factor 10) in
each step, so that software and data management can keep up with hardware
upgrades.

DON KURTZ, Cape Town Univ.

TAOS V*: Some shorter period photometrically variable stars.

I will discuss a variety of variable stars near and below the main sequence 
which may be studied by TAOS. Some of the astrophysics of these stars will be 
explained to show why they are interesting and will be an important product of 
TAOS. I will also show a some results of observations made with 0.5-m telescopes 
and discuss the photometric precision which may be expected. Stars to be 
discussed are: 

Eruptive Variable stars: 
LBVs
S Doradus stars
Luminous Blue Variables
Wolf-Rayet stars
HAeBe stars
T Tauri stars
Flare stars. 

Rotational Variable Stars:
Ap; Bp; CP stars
A and B peculiar; chemically peculiar stars
Ellipsoidal Variable stars
BY Draconis stars
FK Comae stars

Pulsating variable stars:
LBVs; ( Cygni stars
Wolf-Rayet stars (?)
( Cephei stars
Be stars
SPBs
Slowly Pulsating B stars
HAeBe stars
( Scuti stars; SX Phe stars; Dwarf Cepheids
roAp stars
rapidly oscillating Ap stars
( Doradus stars
EC 14026 stars; sdBVs
sub-dwarf blue variables
PNNV, DOV/PG1159/GW Vir, DBV, DAV/ZZ Ceti stars

I will give some background on asteroseismology, discuss problems in frequency 
analysis, and show results of the kind TAOS may obtain for selected projects 
with the emphasis that there is interesting, new stellar astrophysics to be done 
with the TAOS data.

DOUG WELCH, MacMaster Univ.

My plan was to spend half my time on MACHO particulars
(goals, instrumentation, data pipeline, archives of various
forms, lessons learned) and half on scientific results
(microlensing, 2nd order ulensing, follow-up results,
variable star results, plans for data products).

Specific variable star results:
 - RRd
 - RR Lyr
 - beat Cepheids (LMC and SMC)
 - RV Tauri and W Vir
 - R CrB
 - eclipsing pulsating stars
 - whatever LPV stuff isn't being covered by others
 - AGN variability
 - X-ray binaries
