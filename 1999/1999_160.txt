Dear TANist,

       This morning I received a telephone call from the Commonwelth 
Publishing Corporation ( 天下文化公司). They plan to invite some 
scholars to give series of talks on natural science to six famous 
senoir high schools: Taipei First Girl's High School, Chung-Sun Girl's 
High School, Ching-Mei Girl's High School, Chien-Kuo High School, 
Cheng-Kung High School and Affiliated High School of NTNU. 

     The Commonwealth Corporation is seeking volunteers to give 
introduction of fundamental research of natural science to those senior 
high school students. Of course, Astronomy and Astrophysics is one 
of the important topics. The talks will be arranged on September to 
December this years. There will be lots of audiences ( almost all the 
students in the school ) because they plan to arrange the talk on 
weekly assembly !

 For those who are interested, please contact Miss Chen in Com-
monwealth (phone: 2517-3688 ext 913) for details.  Yuo can also 
contact me, I will forward the message to her.
