The AAS Career Workshop will take place once again at the 
January 2000 Winter Meeting.  The Workshop will provide 
participants with valuable information on the many career 
choices open to astronomers today as well as sharpen their
job-hunting skills.
 
Astronomer Dennis Ebbets of Ball Aerospace will present 
the program. Topics discussed include How to Prepare an 
Effective Resume, Interviewing Skills, Networking, Job 
Search Skills, and much more.
 
Workshop participants can participate in one-on-one 
sessions at the program's conclusion and will receive 
career development materials.

8.  EUVE EPISODE 8 CALL FOR OBSERVING PROPOSALS
    Release Date: 11 August 1999
    Letters of Intent Due: 15 September 1999
    Proposals Due: 13 October 1999

The Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer (EUVE) Observatory at 
the University of California, Berkeley (UCB) has issued 
a call for EUVE observing proposals for Episode 8 for 
observations to be scheduled approximately March 2000
through February 2001. Letters of Intent are due midnight
PDT, Wednesday, 15 September 1999.  Proposals are due 
midnight PDT, Wednesday, 13 October 1999. 

EUVE is a NASA Explorer-class satellite mission devoted
entirely to observations in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) 
wavelength range from 70 to 760 Angstrom.  EUVE has 
carried out an all-sky survey in four photometric EUV 
bandpasses, detecting over 1000 new EUV sources. Through 
a GO program over 400 sources have been observed 
spectroscopically.

Time during Episode 8 will be made available to the
astrophysics community through a peer-review process.  
It is expected that this will be the last EUVE call for 
proposals.  

For Episode 8, the EUVE Science Advisory Board is
encouraging the submission and scheduling of large 
observing programs with long exposure blocks 
(900 ksecs or longer). Coordinated observations 
(i.e. those proposals that include targets to be 
observed by EUVE and another orbiting satellite such 
as ASCA, AXAF, FUSE, HST, etc.) are also being encouraged.  
Smaller non-coordinated observing programs will still be 
considered on a time-availability basis, but the bulk of 
the Episode 8 observing time will be awarded to larger 
and/or coordinated observing proposals.

Proposals are being accepted through the Center for EUV
Astrophysics' web-based proposal submission system at

http://www.cea.berkeley.edu/~science/html/EUVE_call99.html

For further details of the instrument performance see: 

http://www.cea.berkeley.edu/~science/html/EUVE_call99_A.html

_________________________________________________________
9.  OBSERVING OPPORTUNITIES WITH ASTRO-E AND ASCA

This is a reminder that the ASTRO-E Cycle 1 Guest Observer 
proposals are due on Friday, 17 September.  For details, 
see the ASTRO-E GOF home page:

http://astroe.gsfc.nasa.gov/

In addition, we will be announcing an opportunity to 
suggest targets for long observations with ASCA during 
its final months in orbit.  The specifics will be announced 
on or about 15 September on the ASCA GOF home page:

http://asca.gsfc.nasa.gov/

which already contains a general plan for the operation of 
ASCA after the launch of ASTRO-E.

_________________________________________________________
10.  NOAO NIGHTTIME PROPOSALS AND COMMUNITY ACCESS ON THE MMT

Proposal forms and information for observing time 
requests for the 2000A semester (February - July 2000) 
at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory and Kitt Peak 
National Observatory and for public-access time on the MMT 
are now available. Proposals must be received by 
30 September 1999, Midnight MST.  Proposals must be 
initiated through a Web form available at:

http://www.noao.edu/noaoprop/

Information about NOAO policies on observing time and 
about facilities and instruments available at CTIO, KPNO, 
and the MMT can be found at the NOAO proposal website at 

http://www.noao.edu/noaoprop/noaoprop.html and in

NOAO's September 1999 Newsletter at 

http://www.noao.edu/noao/noaonews.html

_________________________________________________________
11.  NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR SERVICE OBSERVING AT CTIO

In an effort to further explore alternative modes of 
scheduling and observing for the U.S. community, NOAO 
will be offering two service observing programs on 
telescopes at CTIO in the upcoming (2000A) semester.  
The first, on the YALO 1.0m telescope, is an extension 
of the existing service observing program operated in 
collaboration with Yale, Portugal, and Ohio State 
University.  In return for providing an IR array for the 
optical/IR camera on YALO, NOAO has obtained an increased 
share of observing time on the telescope, up to 27.5% of 
the "non-Galactic Bulge" time.  This facility is 
especially well suited for programs needing both optical 
and IR observations and/or sampling frequencies of less 
than 5 days.

The second service observing opportunity is a new program, 
the Synoptic/Service/Target-of-Opportunity (SSTO) program 
on the CTIO 0.9m.  This is an experimental program which 
offers service observing in BVRI filters approximately 
one night out of every 5 nights (between normally 
scheduled observing runs), amounting to roughly 20% 
of the time on the telescope.  The parameters of this 
program are designed to complement the YALO program, 
offering service observing throughout the semester 
(including the Galactic Bulge season) with a lower sampling
frequency.

Additional information about both of these programs 
is available at

http://www.ctio.noao.edu/servobs.  

Proposals for these programs should be submitted through 
the normal NOAO proposal process (as described above).

12.  SEEKING NOMINATIONS FOR COSPAR AWARDS AND MEDALS
    Due: 24 September 1999

The Committee on Space Research (COSPAR) is seeking 
candidates to be nominated for COSPAR Awards and Medals, 
which recognize the outstanding achievements of space 
scientists throughout the world.  COSPAR will present 
the awards at its 33rd Scientific Assembly to be held in 
Warsaw, Poland, July, 2000.

Nomination forms can be obtained from Pamela Whitney  
(202-334-3477, e-mail: pwhitney@nas.edu) at the National 
Research Council, Space Studies Board (SSB), which is 
the U.S. adhering body to COSPAR.  All nominations will 
be processed by the SSB and must be endorsed by the 
U.S. National Representative to COSPAR, 
Dr. L. J. Lanzerotti.  Completed nomination packages must 
be submitted to the SSB no later than 24 September 1999.

More information on COSPAR Awards can be found on the 
COSPAR Homepage:  http://cospar.itodys.jussieu.fr
