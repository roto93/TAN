	    TITLE:   "A Development of a Millimeter Polarimeter for=20
	              Investigating Interstellar and Circumstellar Magnetic"
	    ABSTRACT:=20
  Molecular clouds are sites of star formation.
Magnetic field may play an important role in a process of
star formation.  To date, precise value for the magnetic
field strength in high density (n($H_{2}$) =1B$B!f=1B(B$10^{4}cm^{-3}$)
regions has not been measured because of observational
difficulties. However, the most crucial aspects of star
formation are predicted to occur in high density regions,
where molecular clouds are collapsing, or dispersing
angular momentum.  We have designed and constructed a
tunable polarimeter to cover frequencies from 35 GHz
to 250 GHz for the 45 m telescope at Nobeyama Radio
Observatory for precise observation and eventual
determination of interstellar and circumstellar magnetic
fields.  The polarimeter has capability of measuring both
circular and linear polarization. The insertion loss was
measured to be 0.14 =1B$B!^=1B(B 0.05 dB in 100 GHz band. The
overall instrumental polarization of the system
in 100 GHz band was found to be as low as 3%.  The performance
of the polarimeter in astronomical observation was tested by
simultaneously measuring the linear polarization of the
J=3D2-1 transition of SiO in the v=3D0 and 1 states at 86 GHz
toward two strong SiO maser objects.  We got the first
observational evidence for the ground vibrational state of
SiO J=3D2-1transition in one source to be maser origin.
      Using the millimeter polarimeter system, we attempted
an observation of Zeeman effect of CCS $J_{N} =3D 4_{3} =1B$B!]=1B(B =
3_{2}$
emission toward one typical dark cloud core in Taurus molecular
cloud complex, L1521E.  Measurements of Zeeman splitting
with the line can provide us the magnetic field strength of the
cloud region where stars will be formed.  We made precise
calculation of g factors of each CCS lines and confirmed some of
them by laboratory microwave spectroscopy.
For the astronomical measurement, we used a low noise receiver
( $T_{sys}$ ~ 170 =1B$B!]=1B(B 200 K) with high frequency resolution =
(${\Delta}$
Freq. =3D2.5 kHz).  From careful analysis and fittings, the magnetic =
field
strength of L1521E with the line is derived to be +160 ${\mu}$ G =
=1B$B!^=1B(B
38 ${\mu}$G (statistical error of the fitting of Stokes V spectrum) =
=1B$B!^=1B(B
19 ${\mu}$G ( pointing error of the telescope).  This is the lowest
upper limit value ofthe magnetic field strength with the radical
so far.
