1.  CLOSURE OF THE UNIVERSITY OF WYOMING DEPARTMENT 
    OF PHYSICS AND ASTRONOMY
    Community Support Needed by 9 April 1999

The Physics and Astronomy Department at the University of Wyoming 
is in jeopardy of being closed.  The department is home to the 
2.3m Wyoming Infrared Observatory (WIRO) telescope, the largest 
telescope in the world in operation by a single university.  The 
draft of the University of Wyoming's Academic Plan for the years 
1999-2004 has recommended:

1) Elimination of the BS, MS, and PhD degrees in Physics 
   and Astronomy,
2) Selling of WIRO,
3) Reduction of the department to a 'service department,' 
   teaching physics coursework to non-physics majors.

Over the years, the department has been the source of major 
advancements in observational astronomy, including infrared 
instrumentation and interferometry. The academic plan draft, 
the department's response, and correspondence contacts (trustees,
newspapers, university officials) may be found at:
http://faraday.uwyo.edu/savephysics.html

The alumni of the department encourage the physics community to 
read the web page, and write the university president, provost, 
and state legislators regarding this ill-advised course of action.  
Correspondence needs to be written by the 9th of April, when the 
second draft of the Academic Plan will begin to be written.

2.  DECADAL SURVEY TOWN MEETING IN CHICAGO 

The Astronomy and Astrophysics Decadal Survey Committee,
co-chaired by Chris McKee and Joe Taylor, will hold a public
Town Meeting at the Chicago AAS Meeting on Tuesday, June 1st
at 8:15 pm.  After a presentation and Q&A period with Chris McKee,
the chairs of the nine panels under the AASC will break out into
separate rooms in order to facilitate further input from the community.
Please plan to attend and provide your valued input to the AASC and
Panels. 

Discounted registration fees for the 194th AAS Centennial Meeting 
30 May - 3 June 1999 at the Hilton Chicago & Towers are in effect 
through 28 April 1999.

3.  DPS 31ST ANNUAL MEETING

You are invited to attend the 31st annual meeting of the
Division for Planetary Sciences of the American
Astronomical Society. The meeting is hosted by the Center
of Studies and Activities for Space "Giuseppe
Colombo" (CISAS) of the University of Padova and will
be held at the Abano Terme Congress Center, 10-15 October 1999.

4.  AAS SMALL RESEARCH GRANT PROGRAM
    Proposals Due: 7 May 1999

The AAS Small Research Grant deadline is fast approaching.  
The Small Research Grant program is funded by NASA, the AAS 
and the Gaposchkins' Research Fund.  Proposals are accepted 
for small research projects requesting amounts between 500 
and 5000 dollars.  Proposals should arrive at the AAS Executive 
Office no later than Friday, 7 May 1999.  Directions for
the proposal format and other information can be found at 
the AAS web site: http://www.aas.org/grants/smrg.html.  
Questions about the program can be sent to Kevin Marvel at 
the AAS Executive Office.

5.  AAS DONATIONS WEBPAGE OPERATIONAL

The AAS Donations Web page is up and running 
http://www.aas.org/donation.  Both institutions and individuals 
can request materials such as journals, books, telescopes, etc. 
as well as offer materials for donation through the page.  
Ed Anderson, ed.anderson@nau.edu, is moderating the donations 
page and can field any questions about the project.  Any policy 
questions regarding the page can be sent to Kevin Marvel, 
AAS Associate Executive Officer (marvel@aas.org).

6.  NSF MPS DIRECTORATE CONTINUES MOVE TO ALL
    ELECTRONIC PROPOSAL SYSTEM

The NSF Mathematics and Physical Science (MPS) directorate is
continuing towards a paperless proposal and award system.  
The current plan is to have a fully implemented system by 
1 July 1999.  Support for implementation throughout the 
Directorate will remain the same as last year, with 
Ms. Florence Rabanal acting as the MPS FastLane Coordinator.  
As always, she is interested in hearing your views about upcoming 
procedural changes, and is available to answer any questions you 
might have.  She may be reached at frabanal@nsf.gov, or by phone at 
703-306-1998.  Questions about proposal content or programmatic 
procedures within the Divisions should be addressed to the relevant 
Program Director. Information about the MPS Directorate, its
staff, programs, and the FastLane implementation plans may be 
found at http://www.nsf.gov/home/mps along with a statement from 
MPS Assistant Director, Robert A. Eisenstein.

The division of Astronomical Sciences has an MPS staff member
responsible for FASTLANE issues.  Her name is Kim Elliott and
she may be contacted with any questions either by email at
Astfl@nsf.gov or by phone at 703-306-1804.
