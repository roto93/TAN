Subject: VLBA Observational Status Summary / update

1999 November 3

Dear Colleague,

The VLBA Observational Status Summary (OSS) was updated today.

This document provides, in concise form, the minimal information
needed to formulate technically sound proposals requesting VLBA
resources.  It also provides lists of relevant software and
documentation, plus a list of key NRAO personnel who can be consulted
for further, more detailed information.

The VLBA OSS is available via either
 + anonymous FTP as a PostScript file with name "obssum.vlba.ps" in
   directory "pub" on host "ftp.aoc.nrao.edu", or
 + WWW browsers.  Use the URL "http://www.nrao.edu/" to point toward
   the NRAO home page, which offers easy selection of the VLBA home
   page.  Both HTML and PostScript versions of the VLBA OSS can be
   accessed from the VLBA home page.

This VLBA OSS update reflects two major changes of interest to users:

 1. VLBA Operations was reorganized November 1.  
    * Dave Medcalf (dmedcalf@nrao.edu) became the VLBA Array
      Operations Supervisor.  He is responsible for coordinating the
      activities carried out on the VLBA antennas, for facilitating
      the daily operations of the array, and for supervising the array
      operators and the tape librarian.
    * Steve Thompson (sthompso@nrao.edu) became the VLBA Correlator
      Operations Supervisor.  He is responsible for facilitating the
      daily operations, testing and maintenance of the correlator; and
      for supervising the correlator operators.
    * Peggy Perley (pperley@nrao.edu) assumed a new position in VLBA
      Operations, that of VLBA Data Quality Coordinator.  She is
      responsible for reviewing routine test results and non-test
      output from both the array and correlator, to identify problems
      and facilitate their efficient repair.  She also serves as an
      assistant to the VLA/VLBA scheduling officer, including
      providing the support needed for dynamic scheduling of the VLBA.
    * The position of Chief VLBA Operator was phased out of VLBA
      Operations.  Peggy Perley had served in that capacity since
      1993.  The VLBA user community and all VLBA staff are indebted
      to Peggy for her highly effective years as Chief VLBA Operator.

 2. References were added to the new book "Synthesis Imaing in Radio
    Astronomy II", Astronomical Society of the Pacific Conference
    Series, Volume 180, eds. G.B. Taylor, C.L. Carilli, and
    R.A. Perley.  Book order information is available from URL
    "http://www.aspsky.org".

Yours sincerely,
J.M. Wrobel
Division Head
Array and Correlator Operations
