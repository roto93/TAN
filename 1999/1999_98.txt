We deeply regret to inform you that Prof V.K. Kapahi passed away, after a
brief illness, on 16 March 1999. He was not only the Co Chairman of the
Scientific Organising Committe of the IAU Symposium 199 on "The Universe
at Low Frequencies", but he was also the Centre Director of National
Centre for Radio Astrophysics, which was hosting the symposium.
This has created some confusion and led to some delays. However, we intend
to hold the Symposium as scheduled and will be sending out the second
circular in early May.

The first circular concerning the IAU Symposium 199 is appended to
this mail.  Please contact us if you need any information earliar.


With best wishes

3. SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE FOR THE SYMPOSIUM: The frequency window available
=09to ground based radio astronomers for exploring the Universe
=09extends all the way from about 20 MHz to 100 GHz. Although much of
=09the early pioneering observations and discoveries in radio
=09astronomy were made at the low frequency end (less than ~1 GHz) of
=09the window, there has been a steady shift in emphasis with time
=09towards higher frequencies for various reasons, the most important
=09of which, was the quest for higher and higher angular resolution.
=09This has resulted in the relative neglect of the low frequency
=09region even though there are many astrophysical problems and
=09phenomena that are best studied at these longer wavelengths.
=09Additional factors which contributed to this situation were
=09technical difficulties associated with low frequency aperture
=09synthesis, such as the need for ionospheric phase correction over
=09large fields of view of the individual array elements, and the
=09need for a 3-D inversion of the visibilities. With the dramatic
=09improvement in the availability of affordable computing power,
=09these problems are now more tractable.=20

=09A few instruments, such as the Very Large Array (VLA), Westerbork
=09Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT), Molonglo Synthesis Telescope
=09(MOST) and Ooty Radio Telescope (ORT) have been making significant
=09contributions at frequencies below ~1 GHz and the new developments=20
=09at some of these observatories should make it possible very soon to
=09considerably strengthen the low-frequency capabilities. While the
=09lowest frequency of operation of the VLA so far was 327 MHz, the
=09system has recently been outfitted to observe also at the much
=09lower frequency of 74 MHz and the first observing runs at this
=09frequency have proved to be very successful.  The wide band feeds
=09on the WSRT antennas would soon provide a near continuous
=09frequency coverage between about 250 MHz and 1.4 GHz for HI
=09studies. In the southern hemisphere, MOST operating at 843 MHz is
=09just commencing one of the most sensitive radio surveys ever
=09undertaken, and a new radio telescope in Mauritius in the southern
=09hemisphere has recently become operational at 150 MHz. Perhaps the
=09most important new development is the Giant Metrewave Radio
=09Telescope (GMRT) near Pune in India which, with its 30 parabolic
=09dishes of 45m diameter each, is the most powerful radio telescope
=09at longer wavelengths operating at a number of radio frequencies
=09between about 150 MHz and 1.4 GHz. Now coming into operation,
=09GMRT can be expected to make a number of important contributions=20
=09in different areas of metre-wavelength radio astronomy.

=09Considering these important developments, an IAU Symposium on
=09``The Universe at Low Radio Frequencies'' in Pune, India, should
=09be scientifically quite fruitful. In addition to reviewing and
=09discussing recent new results in a number of astrophysical areas,
=09the symposium will also address the special instrumental and other
=09problems associated with doing radio astronomy at low radio
=09frequencies, such as wide field mapping, ionospheric effects,
=09interference excision, etc. It would also serve to focus attention
=09on the technical aspects of the future Square Kilometre Array
=09project and the science that it would make possible.
