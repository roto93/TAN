We have used the rocket-borne Wide-Field Imaging Survey Polarimeter (WISP) to 
image a $1\fdg5 \times 4\fdg8$ area of the western side of the
Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) at a wavelength of $\lambda =
2150 \AA$  and a resolution of 1$'' \times 1\farcm5$.
These are the first wide-field
ultraviolet polarimetric images in astronomy.
We find the UV background light of the LMC to be linearly
polarized at levels ranging from our sensitivity limit of 4\% to 
as high as $\approx$40\%.  In general, the polarization in a pixel
increases as the flux decreases; the weighted mean value of
polarization across the WISP field is 12.6\% $\pm$2.3\%.  
The LMC's diffuse UV background, in uncrowded areas, rises from a minimum of 
5.6 $\pm$3.1 \cgssb (23.6 $\pm$0.5 \surfb) to
9.3 $\pm$1.1 \cgssb (23.1 $\pm$0.2 \surfb) in regions near the 
bright associations.   We use our polarization maps to investigate
the geometry of the interstellar medium in the LMC, and to 
search for evidence of a significant contribution of scattered
light from OB associations to the diffuse galactic light of the LMC.
Through a statistical analysis of our polarization map, we identify
9 regions of intense UV emission which may be giving rise to
scattering halos in our image.
We find that starlight from the N 11 complex and 
the LH 15 association are the strongest contributors to the scattered
light component of the LMC's diffuse galactic light.  This region
of the northwestern LMC can be thought of as a kiloparsec-scale 
reflection nebula
in which OB stars illuminate distant dust grains, which scatter the
light into our sightline.  In contrast, the polarization map 
does not support the scattering of light from the large B2 complex
in the southern WISP field; this effect may be astrophysical, or it
may be the result of bias in our analysis.

Motivated by new sounding-rocket wide-field polarimetric images of the 
Large Magellanic Cloud (Cole et al. 1999a), we have used a 
three-dimensional Monte Carlo radiation transfer code to 
investigate the escape of near-ultraviolet photons from young
stellar associations embedded within a disk of dusty material
(i.e., a galaxy).  As photons propagate through the disk,
they may be scattered or absorbed by dust. Scattered photons
are polarized and tracked until they escape to be observed;
absorbed photons heat the dust, which radiates isotropically
in the far-infrared, where the galaxy is optically thin.
The code produces four output images: near-UV and far-IR flux,
and near-UV images in the linear Stokes parameters Q and U.  From these images
we construct simulated UV polarization maps of the LMC.  We
use these maps to place constraints on the star$+$dust geometry
of the LMC and the optical properties of its dust grains.
By tuning the model input parameters to produce maps that
match the observed polarization maps, we derive information about the
inclination of the LMC disk to the plane of the sky, and about
the scattering phase function $g$.  We compute a grid of models
with $i$ = 28$\arcdeg$, 36$\arcdeg$, and 45$\arcdeg$, and $g$ = 0.64,
0.70, 0.77, 0.83, and 0.90.   The model which best reproduces the
observed polarization maps has $i$ = 36$\arcdeg^{+2}_{-5}$ and 
$g$ $\approx$ 0.7.  Because of the low signal-to-noise in the data,
we cannot place firm constraints on the value of $g$.
The highly inclined models do not match the observed centro-symmetric
polarization patterns around bright OB associations, or the 
distribution of polarization values. 
Our models approximately reproduce the observed ultraviolet
photopolarimetry of the western side of the LMC; however, the
output images depend on many input parameters and are nonunique.
We discuss some of the limitations
of the models and outline future steps to be taken; our models make
some predictions regarding the polarization properties of diffuse
light across the rest of the LMC.

{\Large\bf SN 1987A's Circumstellar Envelope, II:\\ \medskip
Kinematics of the Three Rings and the Diffuse Nebula}

We present several different measurements of the velocities of structures
within the circumstellar envelope of SN 1987A, including the inner, equatorial
ring (ER), outer rings (ORs), and the diffuse nebulosity at radii < 5 pc, based
on CTIO 4m and HST data. A comparison of STIS and WFPC2 [N II]6583 loci for the
rings show that the ER is expanding in radius at 10.5+-0.3 km/s, with the
northern OR expanding along the line of sight at about 26 km/s, and for the
southern OR, about 23 km/s. Similar results are found with CTIO 4m data.
Accounting for inclination, the best fit to all data show both ORs with an
expansion from the SN of 26 km/s. The ratio of the ER to OR velocities is
nearly equal to the ratio of ER to OR radii, so the rings are roughly
homologous, all having kinematic ages corresponding to about 20,000 yr before
the SN explosion. This makes previously reported, large compositional
differences between the ER and ORs difficult to understand. Additionally, a
grid of longslit 4m/echelle spectra centered on the SN shows two velocity
components over a region roughly coextensive with the outer circumstellar
envelope extending about 5 pc (20 arcsec) from the SN. One component is
blueshifted and the other redshifted from the SN centroid by about 10 km/s
each. These features may represent a bipolar flow expanding from the SN, in
which the ORs are propelled 10-15 km/s faster than that of the surrounding
envelope into which they propagate. The kinematic timescale for the entire
nebula is at least about 350,000 yr. The kinematics of these various structures
constrain possible models for the evolution of the progenitor and its formation
of a mass loss nebula.

We present Period-Luminosity-Color and Period-Luminosity relations of
classical Ce\-pheids constructed for about 1240 Cepheids from the LMC
and 2140  from the SMC. High quality {\it BVI} observations (120--360
epochs in the {\it I}-band and 15--40 in the {\it BV}-bands) were
collected during the OGLE-II microlensing experiment. The {\it I}-band
diagrams of the LMC show very small scatter, $\sigma=0.074$~mag,
indicating that Cepheid variables can potentially be a very good
standard candle.
 
We compare relations of fundamental mode Cepheids from the LMC and SMC
and we do not find significant differences of slopes of the
Period-Luminosity-Color and Period-Luminosity relations in these
galaxies. For the first overtone Cepheids a small change of the slope of
Period-Luminosity relation is possible. 
 
We determine the difference of distance moduli between the SMC and LMC
with Cepheid relations and compare the result with difference obtained
with other standard candles: RR~Lyr and red clump stars. Results are
very consistent and indicate that the values of zero points of the
fundamental mode Cepheid relations are similar in these galaxies. The
mean difference of distance moduli between the SMC and LMC is equal to
$\mu_{SMC}-\mu_{LMC}=0.51\pm0.03$~mag.

We calibrate the Period-Luminosity-Color and  Period-Luminosity
relations for classical, fundamental mode  Cepheids using the observed
LMC relations and adopting the short LMC distance modulus,
$\mu_{LMC}=18.22\pm0.05$~mag, resulting from the recent determination
with eclipsing system HV2274, RR~Lyr and red clump stars.
 
Finally, we determine a constraint on the absolute magnitude of Cepheids
by comparison of their mean {\it V}-band magnitude with that of RR~Lyr
stars in both Magellanic Clouds. The 10-day period, fundamental mode
Cepheid is on average $4.63\pm0.05$~mag brighter than RR~Lyr stars of
LMC metallicity which with the most likely calibration of the brightness
of RR~Lyr stars yields $M_V^{C,10}=-3.92\pm0.09$~mag.

We present a catalog containing 
290 LMC and 590 SMC Cepheids which have been obtained
using the two 4k $\times$ 8k CCD cameras of 
the EROS 2 microlensing survey.
The Cepheids were selected from 1,134,000 and 504,000 stars in the central 
regions of the LMC and SMC respectively, that were monitored over 150 nights 
between October 1996 and February 1997, at a rate of one measurement
every night. For each Cepheid the light curves, period, magnitudes in the EROS~2 filter system,
Fourier coefficients, J2000 coordinates and cross-identifications 
with objects referenced in the CDS Simbad database
are presented. Finding charts of identified Cepheids in clusters NGC 1943, NGC 1958 and Bruck 56
are presented. The catalogue and the individual light--curves
will be electronically available through the CDS (Strasbourg). \\

    The period-luminosity relation of Miras and semiregular variables
    in the Large Magellanic Cloud and in the Galaxy is used to locate
    their instability domain in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. We
    take advantage of the considerable width in luminosity of the
    relation at given period to assign masses to the observed
    long-period variables using stellar models on the the asymptotic
    giant branch and nonadiabatic pulsation computations. We study the
    sensitivity to chemical abundance of the position of the
    instability region on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. The mass
    function of the long-period variables along the AGB is discussed
    for Galactic and LMC variables.  Finally, we contribute to the
    dispute on the pulsation mode of Miras and lend support to the
    view that, for most of the Mira variables, the pulsation in the
    fundamental mode is more likely.

This paper presents analysis and interpretation of OGLE photometric
data of four X-ray binary pulsar systems in the Small Magellanic
Cloud: 1WGA J0054.9-7226, RX J0050.7-7316, RX J0049.1-7250, and 1SAX
J0103.2-7209.  In each case, the probable optical counterpart is
identified on the basis of its optical colours. In the case of RX
J0050.7-7316 the regular modulation of its optical light curve 
appears to reveal an
ellipsoidal modulation with a period of 1.416 days.  Using reasonable
masses for the neutron star and the B star, we show that the amplitude
and relative depths of the minima of the I-band light curve of RX
J0050.7-7316 can be matched with an ellipsoidal model where the B star
nearly fills its Roche lobe. For mass ratios in the range of 0.12 to
0.20, the corresponding best-fitting inclinations are about 55 degrees
or larger.  The neutron star would be eclipsed by the B star at
inclinations larger than $\approx 60^{\circ}$ for this particular mass
ratio range.  Thus RX J0050.7-7316 is a good candidate system for
further study.  In particular, we would need additional photometry in
several colours, and most importantly, radial velocity data for the B
star before we could draw more quantitative conclusions about the
component masses.\\

The young populous cluster NGC 1866 in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC),
which is probably one of the most massive objects formed in the LMC during 
the last $\sim 3$ Gyr, appears to have an unexpectedly high mass-to-light 
ratio.  {From} its velocity dispersion Fischer et al. (1992) find its mass
to be ($1.35\pm0.25$) $\cdot 10^5$ M$_{\odot}$.  The luminosity of this
cluster is $M_V = -8.93 \pm 0.13$, corresponding to $L_V = (3.2 \pm 0.4) \cdot
10^5 L_{V,\odot}$.  This yields M/$L_V = 0.42 \pm 0.09$ in solar units.  For
a cluster of age 0.1 Gyr such a relatively high mass-to-light ratio requires
a mass spectrum with an exponent $x = 1.72 \pm 0.09$; or $x = 1.75 \pm 0.09$
if mass loss by evolving stars is taken into account.

We report new photometry of populous intermediate-age clusters in the SMC 
using the {\sl Hubble Space Telescope}. In contrast to the accepted picture, 
these clusters appear to have formed in two brief intervals, one $8\pm 2$ Gyr 
ago, and a more recent burst $2\pm 0.5$ Gyr ago.  When the ridgelines of the 
four clusters (NGC 339, 361, 416, and Kron 3) in the 8 Gyr burst are aligned, 
the dispersion in turnoff luminosities is $<0.2$ mag, corresponding to a 
maximum age spread of $\pm 0.7$ Gyr. When the ridgelines of three clusters 
(NGC 152, 411, and 419) in the 2 Gyr burst are aligned, the maximum dispersion 
of 0.2 mag in turnoff luminosity corresponds to a permitted age spread of 
$\pm 0.2$ Gyr.
Within each group of clusters, the entire cluster loci (including
red giant branches and clumps) are nearly identical, consistent
with indistinguishable metallicities and ages. In contrast to the wide 
dispersion in ages previously reported in the literature, our sample 
with more precise photometry and age measurements supports a 
burst-punctuated rather than a continuous cluster formation history 
for the 2 Gyr and 8 Gyr SMC clusters.

We present derivations of star formation histories based on
color-magnitude diagrams of three fields in the LMC from HST/WFPC2
observations. A significant component of stars older
than 4 Gyr is required to match the observed color-magnitude diagrams.
Models with a dispersion-free age-metallicity relation are unable to
reproduce the width of the observed main sequence; models with a range
of metallicity at a given age provide a much better fit. Such models
allow us to construct complete ``population boxes'' for the LMC based
entirely on color-magnitude diagrams; remarkably, these qualitatively
reproduce the age-metallicity relation observed in LMC clusters.  We
discuss some of the uncertainties in deriving star formation histories.
We find, independently of the models, that the LMC bar field has a larger
relative component of older stars than the outer fields. The main
implications suggested by this study are: 1) the star formation history
of field stars appears to differ from the age distribution of clusters,
2) there is no obvious evidence for bursty star formation, but our
ability to measure bursts shorter in duration than $\sim$ 25\% of any
given age is limited by the statistics of the observed number of stars,
3) there may be some correlation of the star formation rate with the
last close passage of the LMC/SMC/Milky Way, but there is no dramatic
effect, and 4) the derived star formation history is probably consistent 
with observed abundances, based on recent chemical evolution models.

	We fit the data for the binary-lens microlensing event
MACHO 98-SMC-1 from 5 different microlensing collaborations and find
two distinct solutions characterized by binary separation $d$ and mass
ratio $q$:  $(d,q)=(0.54,0.50)$ and $(d,q)=(3.65,0.36)$, where 
$d$ is in units of the Einstein radius.
However, the relative proper motion of the lens is very similar in the two
solutions, $1.30\,$km/s/kpc and $1.48\,$km/s/kpc,
thus confirming that the lens is in the Small Magellanic Cloud.
The close binary can be either rotating or approximately
static but the wide binary must be rotating at close its maximum allowed rate
to be consistent with all the data.
We measure limb-darkening coefficients for five bands ranging from 
$I$ to $V$.  As expected, these progressively decrease with rising wavelength.
This is the first measurement of limb darkening for a metal-poor A star.

The rich star clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) are ideal
for studying the process of star formation.  Here we focus on the
determination of age spreads amongst the massive stars in two young
clusters, NGC1818 and NGC1805. We present colour magnitude diagrams
(derived from HST data) for these clusters, and discuss the
difficulties in age spread determination.
