   ***       AUSTRALIA TELESCOPE NATIONAL FACILITY       ***

           Second announcement - 
  note change to availability of 1.5C array (early May, not Sept)


     Applications for observing time are now invited for the 99MAYT
                for the following telescopes:

                  Compact Array, Narrabri
                  Parkes Radiotelescope
                  Mopra Antenna, Coonabarabran
          and for VLBI Observations using any or all of the above.


    *****************************************************************
    *     CLOSING DATE for applications is 15th February 1999        *
    *     4 MONTH Observing term MAY to AUGUST 99 (99MAYT)       *
    *****************************************************************

    IF THE CLOSING DATE FALLS AT THE WEEKEND OR ON A PUBLIC HOLIDAY
          IT IS EXTENDED TO 1700 AEST ON THE NEXT WORKING DAY


Application forms, details of Telescope Availability and other
documentation      will be available on WWW * within the next few days *

    at the WWW address http://www.atnf.csiro.au/observers/


**  NOTE THAT FOR THE COMPACT ARRAY NARRABRI:
The 99MAYT period will run from 30 April until 31 August 1999. The
term will begin with the Array in the 1.5C configuration. The other
configurations offered for 99MAYT will be 6A, 6D, 1.5D, 750D & 375.
Observers are invited to propose projects using any of these
configurations, but note that the 1.5C Array will be available only in
early May.

The Compact Array upgrade work will continue during the 99MAYT period.
This work will not result in the availability of any major new
facilities during this term.

The Guide to Observations with the ATCA contains much of the information
needed to write a proposal. Information on Service Observations at the
ATCA is also available.
