                          ISO BEYOND THE PEAKS
             The 2nd ISO workshop on analytical spectroscopy 
                           2-4 February 2000

            -------------------------------------------------
           |3rd Announcement: Invited Programme and Reminders|
            -------------------------------------------------


This announcement contains the invited programme for the workshop and
reminders of the deadline of ** 1 DECEMBER 1999 ** for submission of
abstracts and for registration.


One of the aims of this workshop -a follow-on to the  "First ISO
Workshop on Analytical Spectroscopy" held in October 1997- is to
review the current ISO spectroscopy heritage.  This will not only
encourage further scientific work on the ISO data themselves but will
also benefit the preparation of future missions such as SIRTF, FIRST, 
SOFIA, NGST, ASTRO-F, etc.  Another aim of the workshop is to assist
in  establishing the final goals for the ISO archive phase and in
defining the end products.

Topics may include, but are not limited to: planetary models; hot and
cool stellar atmosphere and wind models or grids of models;
photoionisation; spectral synthesis; circumstellar and interstellar
dust features; dust in  planetary environments; the diffuse ISM;
galaxies; optical depth effects and  estimation; laboratory studies
and line lists; ices and unidentified IR features; PDRs; molecular
line modelling and data interpretation; and data  reduction techniques
for optimising scientific output from standard data products. 

The second announcement available on the WWW at:

http://www.iso.vilspa.esa.es/meetings/beyondthepeaks/2nd_announcement.html

contains information on the scientific and local organising
committees, calendar of events, contributed papers, proceedings, hotel
information, transport, registration, submission of abstracts etc.  
This announcement does not repeat those details - please refer to the
second announcement.



Reminders
---------

Abstracts:
- - - - - -

The deadline for submission of abstracts for contributed papers and 
posters is:

       1 December 1999.

The template for abstracts is provided at:

http://www.iso.vilspa.esa.es/meetings/beyondthepeaks/abstract-template.tex

The SOC will review the submitted abstracts in the first two weeks of
December to establish the programme of contributed talks and posters.


Registration:
- - - - - - - 

The meeting room at the ISO Data Centre can only accommodate some 90-100
participants; expressions of interest from the first 2 announcements are
coming close to that number.  Thus, if you wish to come to the
workshop, please let the ISO helpdesk <helpdesk@iso.vilspa.esa.es> know, as
described in the second announcement, before:

       1 December 1999.




Invited Programme
-----------------

The programme will consist of about 20 invited talks plus some 30
contributed talks and posters.  Ample time will be allocated for
discussions and for viewing posters.  The workshop talks will concentrate
on discussing scientific results coming from the ISO spectroscopic
observations, their relation to models and laboratory measurements.

The confirmed invited talks are as follows;  1 or 2 further talks are
still under discussion for addition to the programme.
