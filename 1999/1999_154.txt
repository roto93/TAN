Title    : Red giant collisions in the galactic centre
Author(s): V. C. Bailey, M. B. Davies
Paper    : MNRAS, in press
EPrint   : astro-ph/9907309

Abstract:
We simulate collisions involving red-giant stars in the centre of our
galaxy. Such encounters may explain the observed paucity of highly
luminous red giants within ~ 0.2 pc of Sgr A*. The masses of the
missing stars are likely to be in the range ~ 2 M_o - 8 M_o.  Recent
models of the galactic centre cluster's density distribution and
velocity dispersion are used to calculate two-body collision rates.
In particular we use stellar-evolution models to calculate the number
of collisions a star will have during different evolutionary
phases. We find that the number of two-body collisions per star is \lo
1 in the central 0.1 pc - 0.2 pc, depending strongly on the
galactocentric radius, with some uncertainty from the assumed cluster
models and stellar-evolution models. Using a 3D numerical
hydrodynamics code (SPH) we simulate encounters involving cluster
stars of various masses with a 2 M_o red giant and an 8 M_o red
giant. The instantaneous mass loss in such collisions is rarely enough
to destroy either giant. A fraction of the collisions do, however,
lead to the formation of common envelope systems where the impactor
and giant's core are enshrouded by the envelope of the giant. Such
systems may evolve to expel the envelope, leaving a tight binary; the
original giant is destroyed.  The fraction of collisions that produce
common envelope systems is sensitive to the local velocity dispersion
and hence galactocentric radius. Whereas most of our collisions lead
to common envelope formation at a few parsecs from Sgr A*, very
few collisions do so within the central 0.2 pc. Using our
collision-rate calculations we then compute the time-scales for a
giant star to suffer such a collision within the galactic
centre. These time-scales are \go 10^9-10 years and so are longer than
the lifetimes of stars more-massive than ~ 2 M_o. Thus the observed
paucity of luminous giants is unlikely to be due to the formation of
common envelope systems as a result of two-body encounters involving
giant stars.
