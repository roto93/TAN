Dear Colleagues:                             September 14, 1999

As an investigator receiving grants from the National  
Science Council, you are probably aware that the NSC funds  
a high-speed network called TANet/I2.  This new network, 
implemented by the National Center for High-performance
Computing at Hsinchu, is now connected to (or peered with) 
the following advanced research networks:

  vBNS of the US MCI-WorldCom (http://www.vbns.net)
  SingAREN of Singapore (http://www.singaren.net.sg)	
  CAnet3 of Canada (http://www.canet3.net)	  
  ESnet of the US Department of Energy (http://www.es.net)
  Internet2 of Israel (http://www.internet-2.org.il)
			
TANet/I2 is built for you.  Please get on the new high-speed 
network and explore the vast cyberspace--to learn, to get 
information and to transfer data.  

International Collaborative Research
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you had wanted to use the Internet as a vehicle to 
engage in international collaborative research, you 
can do it now.  We have the guidelines for you to 
collaborate with investigators in the US, please 
contact us promptly.  Or visit:

http://www.tanet2.net.tw/chinese/applications


Grant Opportunity
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If your institution is not yet connected to TANet/I2, please
get in touch with your Computer Center.  We are accepting
another round of application to connect.  This will take
the collaborative effort of you, the researcher, and the 
technical experts at CC to come up with a proposal to link
up.  Act quickly.  The deadline is October 31, 1999.
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Please visit the TANet2 website for details.

   http://www.tanet2.net.tw

We are working very hard at linking up with other advanced 
research networks.  Our ongoing effort to peer includes:

 NIHnet of the US National Institutes of Health
 APAN (Asia-Pacific Advanced Netowrk) -- with Japan, Korea,
    Singapore and Australia now linked.  Other economies 
    will soon follow.
 Mirnet (of Russia)

Please share this information with your colleagues, who 
may not read emails regularly.  Thank you,
