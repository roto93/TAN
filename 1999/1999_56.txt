    TITLE:   "INDIA'S GMRT --- SPECS AND SPECIALTIES"
	    
    ABSTRACT:	In India's State of Maharashtra lies this country's most 
		ambitious astronomy project.  The Giant Metre-Wave Radio 
		Telescope (GMRT) is a VLA-style radio interferometer 
		designed to operate at cm wavelengths.  Now in the 
		"debugging stage" of operations, this telescope will have 
		more than 3 times the sensitivity of the VLA when optimum 
		performance is reached.  This illustrated talk will outline 
		the GMRT's specifications, some of the science projects
		envisioned for it, and its current status.

    TITLE:   "THE OUTFLOW PHENOMENON --- 
			ARE GALAXIES EVAPORATING?"
                      
    ABSTRACT:	Galaxy outflows have been observed from the early days 
		of radio astronomy in the form of powerful jets from 
		the nuclei of elliptical galaxies.  In the 1980s, similar 
		but smaller features were observed in some spiral galaxies, 
		most notably the Seyferts.  Now, evidence is mounting that 
		gaseous outflows may be quite common in star forming 
		galaxies.  These outflows appear to originate from the 
		disk and may be related to underlying active regions.  
		However,  the energies required to produce some of the 
		observed features appear to be prohibitively large.  The 
		fate of the gas is simlarly uncertain -- does the gas cycle 
		through the halo and return to the disk, or does it leave 
		the galaxy altogether, enriching the intergalactic medium 
		in the process?  This talk will summarize the observational 
		evidence for galaxy outflows and discuss some possible 
		causes and consequences.
