Astronomers see shadow of planet cross distant star, proving that
extrasolar planets are real

Nashville, Tenn., and Berkeley, Calif. -- Astronomers have witnessed for
the first time a distant planet passing in front of its star, providing
direct and independent confirmation of the existence of extrasolar
planets that to date have been inferred only from the wobble of their
star.

"This is the first independent confirmation of a planet discovered through
changes in a star's radial velocity and demonstrates that our indirect
evidence for planets really is due to planets," said Geoffrey Marcy, a
professor of astronomy at the University of California, Berkeley.

Marcy and his colleagues, Paul Butler of the Department of Terrestrial
Magnetism at the Carnegie Institution of Washington in Washington, D.C.,
and Steve Vogt of UC Santa Cruz and Lick Observatory, first detected a
wobble in the star called HD 209458 on Nov. 5. Ascribing the wobble to a
nearby planet, they were able to estimate its orbit and approximate mass.

As with all new planets they detect, the team immediately brought it to
the attention of collaborator Greg Henry, an astronomer at the Tennessee
State University Center of Excellence in Information Systems in Nashville.
He conducts research with several automatic telescopes at Fairborn
Observatory, a non-profit research foundation located in the Patagonia
Mountains of southern Arizona.

Henry turned one of his automatic telescopes on the star at the time Marcy
and Butler predicted the planet would cross the face of the star if the
planet's orbital plane were lucky enough to carry it between Earth and the
star. Until now, none of the 18 other extrasolar planets Marcy and Butler
have discovered has had its orbital plane oriented edge-on to Earth so that
the planet could be seen to transit the star, nor have any of the other
planets discovered by other researchers.

However, on Nov. 7, Henry observed a 1.7 percent dip in the star's brightness.
Because the planet orbits its star once every 3.523 days, he plans to repeat
his observations on Sunday, Nov. 14.

"This planetary transit occurred at exactly the time predicted from Marcy's
observations, confirming absolutely the presence of a companion," Henry
said. "The amount of dimming of the star's light during the transit also
gives us the first-ever measure of the size and density of an extrasolar
planet. We've essentially seen the shadow of the planet and used it to
measure the planet's size."

The star HD 209458 is 47 parsecs (153 light years or 1.4 million billion
kilometers or 859,000 billion miles) away in the constellation of Pegasus,
and is about the same age, color and size as our own Sun. It is very near
the star, 51 Pegasi, around which the first extrasolar planet was
discovered in 1995.

With the orbital plane of the planet known, the astronomers for the first
time could determine precisely the mass of the planet and, from the size
of the planet measured during transit, its density.

Interestingly, while the planet's mass is only 63 percent of Jupiter's mass,
its radius is 60 percent bigger than that of Jupiter. This fits with theories
that predict a bloated planet when, as here, the planet is very close to the
star.

The density, about 0.2 grams per cubic centimeter, means it is a gas giant
like Jupiter. However, such gas giants could not have formed at the distance
this planet is from its star.

"This supports the theory that extrasolar planets very near their star did
not form where they are, but formed farther out and migrated inward,"
Henry said.

Various groups around the world have been searching for planets by looking
for dimming of stars, or as Marcy says, "staring at the sky and seeing if any
star blinks." To date, none of these searches has turned up a new planet.

"With this one, everything hangs together," Marcy said. "This is what we've
been waiting for."

The research was supported by the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, the National Science Foundation, Sun Microsystems and the
Richard Lounsbery Foundation.
