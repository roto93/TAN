Killer Quake Hit Taiwan and Slammed Its Telecommunications
   Infrastructure in Disarray

A cataclysmic quake registering 7.3 on the Richter 
scale hit the Island in the darkness hour of 1:47 
a.m. local time on September 21.  The earthquake and 
its aftershocks slammed much of the infrastructure 
in disarray.  Telecommunications services were down.  
An estimated 35 million cellular phones, roughly 32% 
of the total, were out of service.  Field deployable 
communications systems were flown in for the rescue 
operation.  Landline services near the epi-center 
were down and at least a submarine cable was down.  
The latter caused telecommunications between Taiwan 
and Japan, Korea, Hong Kong and the US to be 
temporarily out of service.  Power outages affected 
much of the north and included the capital city of 
Taipei.  Power did return to normal a couple weeks 
after the quake but not for towns and villages where 
the most devastation took place.  All resources 
needed for the rescue operation were shifted to the 
quake sites.  The government promptly issued 
disaster alerts and called for conservation of 
electricity and water.  We at the NCHC, blessed to 
have our own generator, voluntarily cut back on power 
consumption and were functioning in half capacity 
for central air conditioning.  We apologize for the 
delay in sending out this issue of the newsletter.

TANet/I2 Re-named TANet2

The Policy Committee of Taiwan's advanced research 
network unanimously endorsed the renaming of 
TANet/I2 to "TANet2."  TANet2 is funded by the 
National Science Council, under which the NCHC is 
charged with its planning and deployment. TANet, by 
birth, is a separate network.  It is funded and 
managed by the Department of Education.  Its acronym 
stands for Taiwan Academic Network, which was first 
connected to the Internet at Princeton, New Jersey 
in 1981.  In the last two years, TANet has expanded 
its services enormously to include high schools and 
elementary schools.  TANet2, by contrast, will 
continue to serve the research community.  Hence, 
TANet and TANet2 will remain to be separate networks 
and the two government agencies will continue to pool 
financial resources in co-funding the networks.  A 
third institution, the Academia Sinica, also lends 
its financial support to TANet2.

Among Peers and in Good Company

TANet2 has been actively seeking partners with 
similar goals to peer with.  Following the two 
peering events with CAnet2 and SingAREN in July 1999, 
we gained three more international partners in 
August.  We are happy to have established peering 
with ESnet, the National Library of Medicine in 
NIHnet and IUCC of Israel.  An MOU with Internet2 
was signed during the Internet2 Members Fall Meeting 
in Seattle, Washington, October 1999.  We are 
looking forward to peering with Abilene such that 
our scientists gain another powerhouse of a network 
as a vehicle for research collaboration.  By popular 
demand, the technical staffs at the Network 
Operation Center had been working hard to implement 
multicast functions.  Mbone was made available 
September 3.  Collaborating scientists can now 
conduct transnational video conferences.

Summer Institute in Taiwan

Under the bilateral research cooperative agreement, 
the NSF (US) and the NSC (Taiwan) will jointly launch 
the "Summer Institute in Taiwan" program next summer.  
This is a program for US graduate students in science 
and engineering to do research in Taiwan during the 
summer months.  Joint approval by both institutions 
is required.  Interested applicants in the US should 
consult NSF web pages for the programs and contact 
information at:
  http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/1999/nsf99152/nsf99152.htm

Information for hosting Taiwan institutions and 
contacts are at:
  http://www.tanet2.net.tw/english/news_&_events
  or
  http://www.nsc.gov.tw/int/

The NCHC is one of the major host institutions ready 
to accept applicants.

TANet99 a Success

The annual gathering for TANet users convened down south 
this year at the beautiful campus of the National Sun 
Yat-sen University.  It was held October 21-23.  The 
Plenary session began with a webcast between the NCHC 
and the NSYSU.  Some of the contributors are from POPs 
and GigaPOPs.  Much of the discussions on technical 
issues centered on network management.  Diffserv, QoS, 
broadband communications are the hot topics.  For the 
educators, distance learning, delivered on-campus or 
disseminated cross-campus through collaborative 
efforts, is an area actively pursued. Dr. Ruey-beei Wu, 
Director of the NCHC also delivered a talk on the 
"Next Generation Research Networks in Taiwan."  

Student participations were down this year because 
of the earthquake.  While the conference was in 
session, on October 22, another quake registered at 
6.8 on the Richter scale took place near the epi-
center of one-month previous.  There was much debate
about whether this seismic event was an aftershock or
a new event.

TaiGer: A Joint Taiwanese-German Project of Coastal 
   Engineering on the Web

This joint project was initiated and conducted 
jointly by Dr. Frank Molkenthin and Dr. Shin-Jye 
Liang.  Dr. Molkenthin of the Institut fuer 
Bauinformatik, Brandenburg University of 
Technology at Cottbus, Germany is a visiting scholar 
at the National Center for High-Performance 
Computing, Taiwan.  Dr. Liang of the NCHC had just 
spent the summer at Cottbus.  More effective 
communications between the two groups await further 
enhancement when peering between TANet2 and the 
German research network can be established.  Below 
is a brief description of the joint project, 
contributed by Dr. Molkenthin. 

Coastal engineering and management contain operation 
and control systems with natural and artificial 
components.  A pre-requisite for such tasks is the
access to the right information at the right time in
the right place -- hence a need for efficient coastal 
information systems.  These information systems can 
only be operated with close collaboration among 
experts from various disciplines at organizations 
located all over the world.  Such collaboration 
demands high-performance networks in order to have 
a distributed environment--to share application and 
information as well as to communicate, coordinate 
and cooperate over the Internet.

The introduction of web-based collaboration to coastal 
engineering is an important element of the ongoing joint 
Taiwanese-German (TaiGer) project.  Initial experience 
in Internet application between Taiwan and Germany 
revealed that a new level of Internet bandwidth was 
required. The exchange of virtual 3D Worlds (VRML and 
OpenGL), interactive dynamic web documents (HTML, 
JavaScript and Java) and GIS models (ARC/INFO) was 
possible but sometimes too slow for practical application.  
Advanced Internet connections linking all parts of the 
world are essential to web applications described above.
