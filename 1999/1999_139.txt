1.  IS AN ASTRONOMY EDUCATION JOURNAL NEEDED?

The American Astronomical Society, the Astronomical Society 
of the Pacific and the American Association of Physics 
Teachers are exploring the need, interest and probable 
readership for an astronomy education journal.

A Survey to collect input from the community is available at:

http://www.brynmawr.edu/Acads/Physics/JBurciaga/survey.html

5. CAREER WORKSHOP IN ATLANTA

The American Astronomical Society is sponsoring a Career Workshop 
at the January 2000 Winter Meeting.  The purpose of the Workshop 
is to provide our members with valuable information on the many 
career choices open to astronomers today, and to help sharpen their
job-hunting skills.

Astronomer Dennis Ebbets of Ball Aerospace will be the speaker. 
Other topics that will be discussed include How to Prepare an
Effective Resume, Interviewing Skills, Networking, Job Search 
Skills, and much more.

Workshop participants will receive career development materials 
and, should time permit, one-on-one sessions afterwards.

6. NEW ASP LISTSERV

The Astronomical Society of the Pacific has started a listserv 
for professional astronomers.  ASP membership is not required 
in order to take advantage of this new service, although we 
welcome new members from all over the globe.  Messages from the 
listserv will be sent approximately bimonthly and will contain 
valuable information about ASP's professional activities
(workshops, meetings, awards) and publications (Conference Series, 
PASP, IAU Symposia).  Participation in the listserv may be 
cancelled at any time.

To subscribe (or unsubscribe) to the listserv please access 
the ASP website at http://www.aspsky.org and click under Professional 
Publications / Listserve, where your email address will be 
requested.  An archive of past Conference Series/ IAU Symposia 
(titles, editors, and tables of contents), available from
the ASP, is also posted at this URL.

7.  CALL FOR PROPOSALS WITH THE OVRO MILLIMETER-WAVE ARRAY

The deadline for proposals for observations with the Owens 
Valley Radio Observatory millimeter-wave array in the period 
September 1999 through January 2000 is 5 pm September 1, 1999.
 
Proposals from investigators who are not at Caltech are 
strongly encouraged!  In the past, external proposals have 
typically received about half of the assigned time in an 
observing season. All proposals are evaluated on a competitive 
basis independent of whether they involve internal collaborators.

Instructions for submitting proposals and technical information 
about the array can be found at the OVRO web site at
 
        http://www.ovro.caltech.edu/mm/main.html
 
New capabilities with the OVRO array that are being offered 
to all observers this season include 2 GHz bandwidth for 
continuum observations and a "compact" configuration for 
extended sources.
 
Questions concerning the interferometer or proposal submission 
should be directed to one of the OVRO postdocs listed at the 
above web site, or by contacting Anneila Sargent at 
afs@astro.caltech.edu (phone: 626-395-6622).
