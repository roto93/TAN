        The aim of this conference is to summarize our present=20
        knowledge on star formation and foresee future directions.
        This conference will cover all the topics related to star=20
        formation, e.g., molecular clouds and cores, protostars
        and their associated disks, jets and other activities from
        YSOs, binary and cluster formation, and star formation in nearby
        and young galaxies. The conference consists of invited talks=20
        by the researchers in the forefront of the study of star=20
        formation. We also prepare a large hall for poster =
presentations.

      It takes about 15 minutes on foot from Motoyama station to Nagoya=20
      University. Municipal buses and taxies are also available. In the=20
      following we describe a route for pedestrians.

      Motoyama station has East and West ticket barriers. You will go=20
      through the East ticket barrier and exit to the ground through =
Exit=20
      No. 3. (Note that the train from down town is East bound). Then=20
      you will be very close to the Motoyama crossing and standing on =
the=20
      south side of the Hirokoji street. You will go up the slope of the =
=20
      Yotsuya street in the south-east direction. Although there are=20
      5 ways from the Motoyama crossing, only the Yotsuya street is the=20
      up-slope and you will not miss it. If you go correctly along the=20
      Yotsuya street, you will find "King Kong" on the right hand side=20
      before reaching the first traffic signal. You will also find=20
      "Toganji Temple" on the left hand side of the street. The second=20
      traffic signal is on the North boundary of the campus of Nagoya=20
      University. We will prepare signboards in the campus to show you=20
      directions.

      The campus has East and West sections. Star Formation 1999 is held =
=20
      in the East section. The East section has four entries. The second
      entry is the entrance to the reception which is held at the=20
      "Rigaku-bu" (School of Science) bldg. The reception room is C221, =
on=20
      the second floor of the building C of "Rigaku-bu". The conference=20
      (oral) is held at Symposion, which is next door to the Toyoda=20
      Auditorium, poster hall. You can access the Toyoda Auditorium from =
=20
      the third and fourth entries. The bus stops are between the third=20
      and fourth entries. There is an open space in front of the Toyoda=20
      Auditorium and you can find it easily.

      If you take taxi from Subway Motoyama Station, specify the=20
      destination, "Nagoya Daigaku, Rigaku-bu" to attend the reception,=20
