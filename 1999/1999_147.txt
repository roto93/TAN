JENAM99: September 7--11, 1999, Toulouse, France \\
Session I on September 10--11, 1999.
\end{center}

\normalsize

{\bf Scope of the session:} \\ The interplay between massive stars and
the ISM plays a fundamental role in the formation and evolution of
galaxies. In addition to providing ionizing photons and newly
synthesized elements, massive stars inject copious amounts of kinetic
energy and momentum to their surrounding gas through stellar winds and
supernovae.  Considerable progress has been made in the recent years
on our understanding of the nature and physics of these feedback
mechanisms and their importance. The aim of this session is to gather
specialists from different fields which allow to contribute to a
consistent picture of these phenomena.

\bigskip
{\bf Scientific program and contributions:} \\
The scientific program includes three main topics:
\begin{itemize}
\item Stellar content and physics of massive star-forming regions 
  (giant HII regions, starbursts) 
\item Chemical enrichment by massive stars 
\item The dynamical impact of star formation on the ISM from small to
large scales 
\end{itemize}

A method for the study of star formation histories of resolved galaxies is 
presented. It is tested with both simulated data of a composite population
and observed data of a globular cluster, which is expected to be a single 
population. The method is then used to study the star formation histories
of WLM, the LMC, and LGS 3.

For WLM, HST F555W and F814W photometry of a portion of the galaxy is  
presented, with the chips aligned such that sample of both the bar and
halo populations were present in the data. The distance modulus for the
globular cluster is calculated to be 24.72 $\pm$ 0.09 from color-magnitude
diagram fitting, with [Fe/H] of -1.51 $\pm$ 0.09 and age of 14.8 $\pm$ 0.7
Gyr. The distance is consistent with distances calculated for the cluster
HB and the field star TRGB. Large-scale star formation in the galaxy began
about 12 Gyr with a short but large burst. Intermediate age star formation
rates are uncertain, but the bar has shown increased star formation during
the past 1.5 Gyr.

The LMC data is ground-based $UBV$ photometry of two fields in the  
northern part of the disk. A distance modulus of 18.40 $\pm$ 0.05 is
calculated. Large-scale star formation began about 12 Gyr ago in this part
of the LMC with a large burst, and slowly decreased. A recent burst began
between 1.0 and 2.5 Gyr ago, and shows different recent star formation
rates in the two fields.

The LGS 3 data is HST-based F555W and F814W photometry, and includes most 
of the galaxy's core and part of the galaxy's halo. The distance modulus
is calculated to be 23.89 $\pm$ 0.05, and is consistent with HB and TRGB
distances. LGS 3 had two bursts of star formation, one beginning 14.5
$\pm$ 0.8 Gyr ago and one beginning between 2.5 and 5 Gyr ago, and ending
at least 200 Myr ago. The recent burst was constrained to the body of the
galaxy.

I have explored the star formation histories of the dwarf irregular
galaxies Sextans A and GR 8. I measured photometry of individual stars
from images taken by the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 aboard the
Hubble Space Telescope. With the photometry I constructed
color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) in the $B$, $V$, and $I$. I
investigated the errors in the photometry extraction, and conducted
artificial star tests to measure the photometric limits. The high
resolution of the Hubble Space Telescope allowed photometric
measurements that were far more accurate than ground-based
observations. For galaxies at these distances (1-2 Mpc), the accuracy
of stellar photometry from ground-based observations is limited by
crowding of stellar images.

The high accuracy photometry showed a clear separation of the main
sequence from the massive, blue, core He-burning stars (HeB). These
are stars in the bluest extent of the so-called ``blue-loop'' phase of
stellar evolution. This is the first time this phase of evolution has
been clearly identified in a low metallicity system. The distributions
of stars in the CMDs agreed very well with stellar evolution model
predictions.

I have used the CMDs to calculate the recent star formation histories
of both galaxies. The main sequence luminosity function provided the
star formation rate (SFR) over the past $\sim 50$ Myr. I developed a
new technique for calculating the SFR from the blue HeB luminosity
function. Furthermore, the blue HeB evolutionary phase has a
one-to-one relation between age and magnitude. This allowed me to
calculate the position, as well as the strength of star formation over
the past $\sim 500$ Myr.

The star formation was found in concentrated regions. These regions
are of order 100 pc across and last of order 100 Myr. The regions were
found near the highest density HI gas.  I estimated the gas-to-star
conversion efficiency to be 5-10\%.  The results from GR 8 suggest
that the star forming gas clouds may be self-gravitating, and that
each cloud can support several star forming episodes.  There is an age
progression among the star forming regions which suggests that the
star formation is propagating through the galaxies.

A study on the chemical abundances of dwarf irregular galaxies (dI's)
is presented in this work. This type of galaxies have typically low
metallicity. First of all, a definition of dI is proposed, in order to
obtain a homogeneous group of targets.

Due to the small size of the dI galaxies and the absence of strong
dynamical processes a homogeneous chemical composition is normally
assumed. The main argument is that the gas in the interstellar medium
of the galaxies are probably not too much affected by internal
dynamics and could therefore be well mixed. This hypothesis has been
investigated. Optical spectra for various star-forming regions
(H\,{\sc ii} regions) in five dI's have been obtained and
analysed. For all the H\,{\sc ii} regions, the chemical abundances of
the whole region have been determined. Spectra of four of these
H\,{\sc ii} regions are of very high quality which allow an additional
study of possible variations of the chemical abundances within the
regions.  It could be concluded that the existence of variations in
the chemical abundances, especially at large scales, may depend on the
physical properties of the galaxy and its environment.

Another important aspect to study is the behaviour of the dI galaxies
in the metallicity-luminosity plane. A deep study of previous
relationships for this kind of objects were performed as well as the
possible sources of dispersion from this relationship.  With the
results on the chemical abundances of eight galaxies and the latest
distance determinations a new, weak, relationship between the
metallicity and the luminosity was derived. The influence of the
environment and other physical properties of the galaxies have also
been studied.

      The small Antlia--Sextans clustering of galaxies is located at a
distance of only 1.36 Mpc from the Sun, and 1.72 Mpc from the adopted
barycenter of the Local Group. The latter value is significantly
greater than the radius of the zero--velocity surface of the Local
Group which, for an assumed age of 14 Gyr, has R$_\circ = 1.18 \pm
0.15$\,Mpc. This together with the observation that the members of the
Ant--Sex group have a mean redshift of $+114 \pm 12$ \kms\ relative to
the centroid of the Local Group, suggests that the Antlia--Sextans
group is not bound to our Local Group, and that is expanding with the
Hubble flow. If this conclusion is correct, then Antlia--Sextans may
be the nearest external clustering of galaxies. The total galaxian
population of the Ant--Sex group is $\sim 1/5$ that of the Local
Group.  However, the integrated luminosity of Ant--Sex is two order
magnitude lower than that of the Local Group.

Hubble's (1936, p.\,125) view that the Local Group (LG) ``is a typical,
small group of nebulae which is isolated in the general field" is
confirmed by modern data. The total number of certain and probable
Group members presently stands at 35. The half--mass radius of the
Local Group is found to be R$_{\rm h} = 350$\,kpc. The zero--velocity
surface, which separates the Local Group from the field that is
expanding with the Hubble flow, has a radius R$_\circ = 1.18 \pm
0.15$\,Mpc. The total mass of the LG is M$_{\rm LG} = (2.3 \pm 0.6)
\times 10^{12}$\,\Msun.  Most of this mass appears to be concentrated
in the Andromeda and Milky Way subgroups of the LG. The total
luminosity of the Local Group is found to be M$_{\rm V} =
-22.0:$. This yield a mass--to--light ratio (in solar units) of
M/L$_{\rm V} = 44 \pm 12$.  The solar motion with with respect to the
LG is $306 \pm 18$\,\kms, directed toward an apex at $l = 99^\circ \pm
5^\circ$ , and $b = -4^\circ \pm 4^\circ$. The velocity dispersion
within the LG is $\sigma_{\rm r} = 61 \pm 8$ \kms. The galaxies
NGC\,3109, Antlia, Sextans\,A and Sextans\,B appear to form a distinct
grouping with V$_{\rm r} = +114 \pm 12$\,kpc, that is located beyond
the LG zero--distance of 1.7\,Mpc from the Local Group centroid. The
luminosity distribution of the LG has a slope $\alpha = -1.1 \pm
0.1$. This value is significantly less negative than that which is
found in rich clusters of galaxies. The luminosity distribution of the
dwarf spheroidal galaxies is steeper than that for dwarf
irregulars. Furthermore the dSph galaxies are strongly concentrated
within the Andromeda and Milky Way subclusters of the Local Group,
whereas the majority of dIrr galaxies appear to be free--floating
members of the LG as a whole. With the possible exception of Leo\,I
and Leo\,A, most LG members appear to have started forming stars
simultaneously $\sim 15$\,Gyr ago. Many of the galaxies, for which
evolutionary data are available, appear to have shrunk with time. This
result is unexpected because {\it Hubble Space Telescope} observations
appear to show galaxies at ${\rm z} \sim 3$ to be smaller than they
are at {\mbox z = 0}. In the Large Magellanic Cloud the rate of
cluster formation was low for a period that extended from $\sim
12$\,Gyr to $\sim 4$\,Gyr ago. The rate of cluster formation may have
increased more rapidly 3--5\,Gyr ago, than did the rate of star
formation. The reason for the sudden burst of cluster formation in the
LMC $\sim 4$\,Gyr ago remains obscure. None of the dwarf galaxies in
the LG appears to have experienced a starburst strong enough to have
produced a ``boojum''.

The star formation history in IZw18 has been inferred from HST/WFPC2
archival data. This is done by comparing the derived V, B--V and V,
V--I color-magnitude diagrams and luminosity functions with synthetic
ones, based on various sets of stellar evolutionary tracks.  At a
distance of 10 Mpc, the stars resolved in the field of IZw18 allow for
a lookback time up to 1 Gyr.  We find that the main body is not
experiencing its first episode of star formation. Instead, it has been
forming stars over the last 0.5--1 Gyr, at a rate of
$\sim$\,1--2\,$\times$\,10$^{-2}$\,M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$kpc$^{-2}$.  A
more intense activity of
6--16\,$\times$\,10$^{-2}$\,M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$kpc$^{-2}$ has taken
place between 15 and 20 Myr ago. For the secondary body, the lookback
time is 0.2 Gyr at most and the uncertainty is much higher, due to the
shallower diagrams and the small number of resolved stars. The derived
range of star formation rate is
3--10\,$\times$\,10$^{-3}$\,M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$kpc$^{-2}$.

The IMF providing the best fit to the observed stellar populations in
the main body has a slope 1.5, much flatter than in any similar galaxy
analyzed with the same method. In the secondary body, it is peaked at
$\alpha\simeq\,$2.2, closer to Salpeter's slope ($\alpha$=2.35).

We present redshift measurements of four faint galaxies around the
archetypical ultraluminous infrared galaxy Arp 220. These galaxies have
significantly higher redshifts ($z \sim$ 0.036 -- 0.091) than that of
Arp 220 ($z \simeq 0.018$).  Therefore, we conclude that they are
background objects not physically related to Arp 220.  Three of these
faint galaxies located to the south of Arp 220 are a group of galaxies
(or the brightest members in a cluster of galaxies) at $z \simeq
0.09$, as suggested by Heckman et al. [1996, ApJ, 457, 616] on the
basis of their associated soft X-ray emission.

We also report the serendipitous discovery of three additional
galaxies at redshift $z \sim 0.5$, found in the two-dimensional
spectra obtained at one of the slit positions.  All three galaxies
exhibit an \mbox{[O {\sc ii}]$\lambda$3727} emission line.  The spectrum of
the brightest galaxy ($m_R \simeq 24.4$) shows other strong emission
lines: Mg {\sc ii} $\lambda$2798, H$\beta$, [O {\sc
iii}]$\lambda$4959, and [O {\sc iii}]$\lambda$5007.  The emission-line
properties of these galaxies as well as their intrinsically low
luminosities ($M_R \geq -18.4$) indicate that they are star-forming
dwarf galaxies.

We present evidence for the existence of an old stellar halo in the
Blue Compact Dwarf galaxy VII~Zw~403.  VII~Zw~403 is the first Blue
Compact Dwarf galaxy for which a clear spatial segregation of the {\it
resolved} stellar content into a ``core-halo" structure is
detected. Multicolor HST/WFPC2 observations indicate that active star
formation occurs in the central region, but is strikingly absent at
large radii.  Instead, a globular-cluster-like red giant branch
suggests the presence of an old ($>$~10~Gyr) and metal poor
($<$[Fe/H]$>$=-1.92) stellar population in the halo. While the vast
majority of Blue Compact Dwarf galaxies has been recognized to possess
halos of red color in ground-based surface photometry, our
observations of VII~Zw~403 establish for the first time a direct
correspondence between a red halo color and the presence of old, red
giant stars.  If the halos of Blue Compact Dwarf galaxies are all home
to such ancient stellar populations, then the fossil record conflicts
with delayed-formation scenarios for dwarfs.

We present $B$-, $V$-, and $I$-band images, as well as an H$\alpha$
image, of And VI. This is the second newly identified dwarf spheroidal
(dSph) companion to M31 found using a digital filtering technique
applied to the second Palomar Sky Survey for which $\sim$1550 deg$^2$
now have been surveyed. And VI was confirmed to be a nearby dSph galaxy
when it resolved into stars easily with a short 4-m $V$-band exposure.
Sub-arcsec images taken at the Kitt Peak WIYN 3.5-m telescope provided
($I$, $V$--$I$) and \mbox{($V$, $B$--$V$)} color--magnitude diagrams that yield
a distance of 775 $\pm$ 35 kpc using the tip of the red giant branch
method, and a mean metallicity of [Fe/H] $= -1.58\pm0.20$ with a
dispersion of $\sim0.3$ dex.  And VI has a galactocentric distance of
$\sim271$ kpc and $M_V = -11.3$. All observed properties of And VI are
consistent with its classification as a dSph companion to M31. Despite
the recent identification of the And V, And VI, and Cas dwarfs, the
Local Group luminosity function remains highly deficient in faint
galaxies relative both to CDM simulations of its formation, and to the
luminosity functions for richer clusters of galaxies.

We present deep $BVI$ CCD photometry of the stars in the dwarf galaxy
DDO 210. The color-magnitude diagrams of DDO 210 show a well-defined red
giant branch (RGB) and a blue plume.  The tip of the RGB is found to be
at $I_{\rm TRGB} = 20.95 \pm 0.10$ mag.  From this the distance to DDO
210 is estimated to be $d = 950\pm 50 $ kpc.  The corresponding distance
of DDO 210 to the center of the Local Group is 870 kpc, showing that it
is a member of the Local Group.  The mean metallicity of the red giant
branch stars is estimated to be [Fe/H] = $-1.9\pm0.1$ dex.  Integrated
magnitudes of DDO 210 within the Holmberg radius ($r_H=110$ arcsec $ =505$ pc)
are derived to be $M_B=-10.6\pm0.1$ mag and $M_V=-10.9\pm0.1$ mag.  $B$
and $V$ surface brightness profiles of DDO 210 are approximately
consistent with an exponential law with scale lengths $r_s(B)$ = 161 pc
and $r_s(V)$ = 175 pc.  The brightest blue and red stars in DDO 210 (BSG
and RSG) are found to be among the faintest in the nearby galaxies with
young stellar populations: $<M_V(3)>_{BSG} = -3.47\pm 0.11$ mag and
$<M_V(3)>_{RSG} = -4.75 \pm 0.13$ mag.  An enhancement of the star
formation rate in the recent past (several hundred Myrs) is observed in
the central region of DDO 210.  The opposite trend is observed in the
outer region of the galaxy, suggesting a possible two-component
structure of the kind disk/halo found in spiral galaxies. The real
nature of this two-component structure must, however, be confirmed
with more detailed observations.

We present deep $BVRI$ CCD photometry of the stars in the dwarf
irregular galaxy UKS 2323--326 in the Sculptor Group.  The
color-magnitude diagrams of the measured stars in UKS 2323--326 show a
blue plume which consists mostly of young stellar populations, and a
well-defined red giant branch (RGB).  The tip of the RGB is found to
be at $I_{\rm TRGB} = 22.65 \pm 0.10$ mag.  From this the distance to
this galaxy is estimated to be $d = 2.08\pm 0.12 $ Mpc.  The
corresponding distance of this galaxy from the center of the Local
Group is 1.92 Mpc, showing that it is located outside the Local
Group. The large distance, combined with its velocity information,
indicates that it is very likely to be a member of the Sculptor Group.
The mean metallicity of the red giant branch is estimated to be [Fe/H]
= $-1.98\pm0.17$ dex.  Total magnitudes of UKS 2323--326 ($<r_H = 70$
arcsec) are derived to be $B^T=14.07$ mag, $V^T=13.50$ mag,
$R^T=13.18$ mag, and $I^T=12.83$ mag, and the corresponding absolute
magnitudes are $M_B=-12.58$ mag, $M_V=-13.14$ mag, $M_R=-13.45$ mag,
and $M_I=-13.79$ mag.  Surface brightness profiles of the central part
of UKS 2323--326 are approximately consistent with a King model with a
core concentration parameter $c = \log (r_t / r_c ) \approx 1.0$, and
those of the outer part follow an exponential law with a scale length
of 21 arcsec. The magnitudes and colors of the brightest blue and red
stars in UKS 2323--326 (BSG and RSG) are measured to be, respectively,
$<V(3)>_{BSG} = 20.33\pm 0.25$ mag, $<(B-V)(3)>_{BSG} = 0.14\pm 0.07$
mag, $<V(3)>_{RSG} = 20.74\pm 0.18$ mag, and $<(B-V)(3)>_{RSG} =
1.35\pm 0.08$ mag.  The corresponding absolute magnitudes are derived
to be $<M_V(3)>_{BSG} = -6.31$ mag and $<M_V(3)>_{RSG} = -5.91$ mag,
which are about half magnitude fainter than those expected from
conventional correlations with galaxy luminosity.

The detection of Ly alpha emission in star-forming galaxies in
different shapes and intensities (always smaller than predicted for
case B recombination) has puzzled the astronomical community for more
than a decade.  Here we use two dimensional calculations to follow the
evolution of superbubbles and of the H II regions generated by the
output of UV photons from massive stars. We show the impact caused by
massive star formation in the ISM of different galaxies and we look at
the conditions required to detect Ly alpha emission from a nuclear H
II region, and the variety of profiles that may be expected as a
function of time.

We examine the correlation between physical quantities to explore the
existence of dark matter (DM) in the Local Group dwarf spheroidal
galaxies (dSphs). In order to clarify whether DM exists in the dSphs
we compare two extreme models of their internal kinematics: [1] a
tidal model (the mass of a dSph is estimated with the luminous mass,
since the observed large velocity dispersions of the dSphs are
attributed to the tidal force by the Galaxy), and [2] a DM model (the
mass of a dSph is estimated with the virial mass, since the velocity
dispersion is considered to reflect the DM potential).  In both
models, we find that the relation between the surface brightness of
the dSphs and the tidal force by the Galaxy is consistently
interpreted. This makes a critical remark about the previous studies
that concluded that the tidal force is effective for the dSphs based
only on model [1]. We also check the correlation between the
Galactocentric distance and the tidal force. Consequently, both models
are also supported in this test. Thus, we are unable to judge which of
the two is more promising for the dSphs in correlation investigations.
The physical process of tidal disruption is also considered.  Since
the timescale for the tidally perturbed stars to escape is much
shorter than the orbital periods of the dSphs, it is difficult for the
tidally perturbed dSphs to exist as an assembly. Thus, we suggest that
the gravitational field of DM is necessary to bind the dSphs with a
large velocity dispersion.

We consider evolution of interstellar clouds in Local Group dwarf
spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) in the context of their observed star
formation histories. The Local Group dSphs generally experienced
initial bursts of star formations in their formation epochs ($\sim 15$
Gyr ago), when hot gas originating from the supernovae could make the
cold interstellar clouds evaporate. We find that the maximum size of
evaporating cloud is 10 pc.  Thus, clouds larger than 10 pc survived
during the initial star formation. These surviving clouds contributed
to the second star formation to produce ``intermediate-age ($\sim
3$--10 Gyr ago) stellar populations.''  Assuming that collisions
between clouds induce star formation and that the timescale of the
second star formation is a few Gyr, we estimate the total mass of the
clouds. The total mass is about $10^{4}M_\odot$, which is 1--3 orders
of magnitude smaller than the typical stellar mass of a present dSph.
This implies that the initial star formation is dominant over the
second star formation, which is broadly consistent with the observed
star formation histories. However, the variety of the dSphs in their
star formation histories suggests that the effects of environments on
the dSphs may be important.

We use Multiple Mirror Telescope (MMT) spectrophotometry and {\sl
Hubble Space Telescope} ({\sl HST}) Faint Object Spectrograph (FOS)
spectra and Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) $V$ and $I$
images to study the properties and evolutionary status of the nearby
($D$ = 11.4 Mpc) extremely metal-deficient blue compact dwarf (BCD)
galaxy SBS 1415+437 $\equiv$ CG 389.  The oxygen abundance in the
galaxy is 12 + log (O/H) = 7.60 $\pm$ 0.01 or $Z_\odot$/21.


The helium mass fraction in SBS 1415+437 is $Y$ = 0.246 $\pm$ 0.004
which agrees with the primordial helium abundance determined by Izotov
\& Thuan using a much larger sample of BCDs.  The
$\alpha$-elements-to-oxygen abundance ratios (Ne/O, S/O, Ar/O) are in
very good agreement with the mean values for other metal-deficient
BCDs and are consistent with the scenario that these elements are made
in massive stars.  The Fe/O abundance ratio is $\sim$ 2 times smaller
than the solar ratio. The Si/O ratio is close to the solar value,
implying that silicon is not significantly depleted into dust grains.
The values of the N/O and C/O ratios imply that intermediate-mass
stars have not had time to evolve in SBS 1415+437 and release their
nucleosynthesis products and that both N and C in the BCD have been
made by massive stars only. This sets an upper limit of $\sim$ 100 Myr
on the age of SBS 1415+437.

 The $V$ and $I$ surface brightness profiles of SBS 1415+437 are well
fitted by exponentials implying that the galaxy is a disk-like
system. The velocity distribution derived from the H$\alpha$ and [O
III] $\lambda$5007 emission lines indicates a solid-body rotation with
a rotational velocity of 80 km s$^{-1}$. The dynamical mass is $\sim$
13 times larger than the gas mass, implying that most of the mass in
SBS 1415+437 is in the form of dark matter.  The $(V-I)$ color of the
low-surface-brightness component of the galaxy is blue ($\leq$ 0.4
mag) indicative of a very young underlying stellar population. The
$(V-I)$ - $I$ color-magnitude diagrams of the resolved stellar
populations in different regions of SBS 1415+437 suggest propagating
star formation from the NE side of the galaxy to the SW.
 
 All regions in SBS 1415+437 possess very blue spectral energy
distributions (SED).  By comparing the observed SEDs to theoretical
SEDs which include both stellar and gaseous emission, we find that the
ages of the stellar populations in SBS 1415+437 to range from a few
Myr to 100 Myr. Thus chemical abundances, color profiles and spectral
energy distributions all say that SBS 1415+437 is a truly young galaxy
which did not start to make stars until $\sim$ 100 Myr ago.

We present the results of surface photometry on a new sample of Blue
Compact Dwarf galaxies (BCDGs), in continuation to a previous paper
(Doublier et al. 1997, A\&AS, 124, 405, hereafter Paper I).  The 22
galaxies (plus two companions) discussed in the present paper have
been selected in the Southern Hemisphere, from several lists. An atlas
containing isophotal maps, surface brightnesses and B--R color
profiles of the sample is given, together with the tables containing
the photometric parameters.

The results are consistent with those obtained in Paper
I for objects selected from the Byurakan Surveys in the Northern
hemisphere. Similarly, we find about one fourth of the BCDGs showing a
dominant r$^{1/4}$ brightness distribution component, one fourth of
the BCDG showing a dominant exponential surface brightness profile,
and about half of them show composite brightness
distributions. Integrated properties, colors, mean surface
brightnesses and luminosity-radius relations are investigated and
discussed for the objects presented in this paper and Paper I.  We
found that r$^{1/4}$ BCDGs tend to show a different behavior compared
to the exponential BCDGs, with respect to colors, compactness and
luminosity-radius relations. We also include a brief study of the
surroundings of the galaxies, where we find several candidate
companions.

We have observed the center of the Local Group dwarf irregular galaxy
IC\,1613 with WFPC2 aboard the {\sl Hubble Space Telescope} in the F439W,
F555W, and F814W filters.  We analyze the resulting color-magnitude
diagrams (CMDs) using the main-sequence and giant branch luminosity
functions and comparisons to theoretical stellar models to derive a
preliminary star-formation history for this galaxy.  We find a
dominant old stellar population (aged $\approx$ 7 Gyr), identifiable
by the strong red giant branch (RGB) and red clump populations.  From
the (V$-$I) color of the RGB, we estimate a mean metallicity of the
intermediate-age stellar population [Fe/H] = $-$1.38 $\pm$ 0.31.  We
confirm a distance of 715 $\pm$40 kpc using the I-magnitude of the RGB
tip.  The main-sequence luminosity function down to I $\approx$ 25
provides evidence for a roughly constant SFR of approximately 3.5
$\times$ 10$^{-4}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ across the WFPC2 field of
view (0.22 kpc$^2$) during the past 250--350 Myr.  Structure in the
blue loop luminosity function implies that the SFR was $\approx$50\%
higher 400--900 Myr ago than today.  The mean heavy element abundance
of these young stars is $\approx$ 1/10 solar.  The best explanation
for a red spur on the main-sequence at I $\approx$ 24.7 is the blue
horizontal branch component of a very old stellar population at the
center of IC\,1613.  We have also imaged a broader area of IC\,1613 using the
3.5-meter WIYN telescope under excellent seeing conditions.  The WIYN
color-magnitude diagram reveals a prominent sequence of asymptotic
giant branch stars and red supergiants that is less prominent in the
WFPC2 CMD due to the smaller field of view.  The AGB-star luminosity
function is consistent with a period of continuous star formation over
at least the age range 2--10 Gyr.  We present an approximate
age-metallicity relation for IC\,1613, which appears similar to that of the
Small Magellanic Cloud.  We compare the Hess diagram of IC\,1613 to
similar data for three other Local Group dwarf galaxies, and find that
IC\,1613 most closely resembles the nearby, transition-type dwarf galaxy
Pegasus (DDO 216).

Dwarf galaxies play an important role in our understanding of galaxy
formation and evolution, and starbursts are believed to strongly affect
the structure and evolution of dwarf galaxies. We have therefore
embarked on a systematic study of 12 of the nearest dwarf galaxies
thought to be undergoing bursts of star-formation. These were selected
primarily by their morphological type (blue ``amorphous'' galaxies). We
show that these blue amorphous galaxies are not physically
distinguishable from dwarfs selected as starbursting by other methods,
such as blue compact dwarfs (BCDs) and H{\sc ii} galaxies. All these classes
exhibit surface brightness profiles that are exponential in the outer
regions ($r \gtrsim 1.5r_e$) but often have a predominantly central blue
excess, suggesting a young burst in an older, redder galaxy. Typically,
the starbursting ``cores'' are young ($\sim 10^7-10^8$ yr) events
compared to the older ($\sim 10^9-10^{10}$ yr) underlying galaxy (the
``envelope''). The ratio of the core-to-envelope in blue light ranges
from essentially zero to about two. These starbursts are therefore
modest events involving only a few percent of the stellar mass.
The envelopes have surface-brightnesses that are much higher than
typical dwarf Irregular (dI) galaxies, so it is unlikely that there is a
straightforward evolutionary relation between typical dIs and dwarf
starburst galaxies. Instead we suggest that amorphous galaxies may
repeatedly cycle through starburst and quiescent phases, corresponding
to the galaxies with strong and weak/absent cores respectively. Once
amorphous galaxies use up the available gas (either through
star-formation or galactic winds) so that star-formation is shut off,
the faded remnants would strongly resemble dwarf elliptical
galaxies. However, in the current cosmological epoch this is evidently a
slow process that is the aftermath of a series of many weak, recurring
bursts. Present-day dEs must have experienced more rapid and intense
evolution than this in the distant past.

 The star formation history of the dE NGC 185, together with its
spatial variations, has been investigated for old, intermediate and
young stars using new ground-based $H_\alpha$ and $BVI$ photometry,
and synthetic color-magnitude diagrams (CMD). We find that the bulk of
the stars were formed in NGC 185 in an early epoch of its
evolution. After that, the star formation proceeded at a low rate
until the recent past, the age of the most recent traces of star
formation activity detected in the galaxy being some 100 Myr old.

As for the spatial variations, the star formation rate $\psi(t)$ for
old and intermediate ages shows a gradient in the sense of taking
smaller values for higher galactocentric radii. Moreover, recent star
formation is detected in the central $150 \times 90$ pc only, where
the youngest, 100 Myr old population is found. No traces of stars born
more recently than 1 Gyr ago are found outside this central
region. Since the higher concentration of stars of any age lies in the
central part of the galaxy, it could be the case that the youngest
stars originate from material ejected from old dying stars and that
this process would only be efficient enough in the center of the
galaxy.

The luminous blue {\it stars} discovered by Baade (1951) in the center
of NGC 185 are discussed using new $B$ CCD images and the original
Baade's photographic plates. Considering their fuzzy, unresolved
aspect and that a conspicuous main sequence is lacking in the CMD at
our limiting magnitude, we reach the conclusion that most of Baade's
blue objects are in fact star clusters. These clusters, as well as
other stellar population, are young (a few 100 Myr), but not as much
as they would be if they were individual stars (a few 10 Myr).

A supernova (SN) remnant close to the center of NGC 185 has been
analyzed from $H_\alpha$ images. The fact that a conspicuous MS is
lacking in our CMD implies that the SN had been originated by a white
dwarf progenitor.

A consistent picture arises in which the gas observed in the central
region of NGC 185 would have an internal origin. The rate at which
evolved stars return gas to the ISM is enough to seed the recent star
formation observed in the center of the galaxy and the SN rate is
probably low enough to allow the galaxy to retain the gas not used in
the new stellar generations. Further support is found in the similar
kinematical properties of gas and stars.

New results are presented for a mosaic mapping of the HI in the field
of the Local Group dwarf galaxy Phoenix.  The observations, obtained
with the Australia Telescope Compact Array, cover an area of $\sim
2^{\rm o} \times 2^{\rm o}$.  Four velocity components are identified,
at heliocentric velocities of $-$23, 7, 59 and 140 \kms.  While the
gas at 7 \kms\ is of Galactic origin and the gas at 140 \kms\ is most
likely associated with the Magellanic Stream, the situation for the
two other components is unsure.  However, it is suggested that the
component at $-$23 \kms\ is probably associated with Phoenix because:
1) it has a compact structure and is only slightly offset from the
optical image, 2) its HI mass of $\sim 10^5 M_{\odot}$ is what can be
expected in such a system, 3) it has a definite velocity gradient, 4)
its location west of Phoenix is compatible with the already suspected
self-propagation from east to west of the last star-formation episode.
Because of the large mass ($\sim 5 \times 10^6 M_{\odot}$) implied if
at the distance of Phoenix, and also because of its large extent, the
component at $+$59 \kms\ is most likely not associated.  Optical
velocities are still needed to confirm or not those possible
associations.

In this paper we briefly review the properties of the dwarf galaxy
population at the core of the Fornax cluster, as well as the
properties of the extraordinary rich globular cluster system and the
cD halo around the central galaxy NGC~1399.  In turn, the question
whether a scenario in which dwarf galaxies have been accreted and
dissolved in the cluster center can explain the observed properties is
addressed.  The possibility of accretion of a certain number of dwarf
galaxies, the stripping of their globular clusters and gas, and the
formation of new globular clusters from stripped infalling gas are
discussed.  An increase in the specific frequency of the central
globular cluster system is only possible, if the infalling gas from
stripped dwarfs formed globulars very efficiently and/or accreted and
stripped dwarf galaxies possessed a rich globular cluster system
themselves. In conclusion, we argue that although the dwarf galaxy
infall is a very attractive scenario to explain a number of properties
in the system there are probably other physical mechanisms that also
take place.

We present a quantitative analysis of the star formation history (SFH)
of the Local Group dSph galaxy Leo I, from the information in its {\it
Hubble Space Telescope} $[(V-I), I]$ color-magnitude diagram (CMD). It
reaches the level of the oldest main-sequence turnoffs, and this
allows us to retrieve the SFH in considerable detail. The method we
use is based in comparing, via synthetic CMDs, the expected
distribution of stars in the CMD for different evolutionary scenarios,
with the observed distribution. We consider the SFH to be composed by
the SFR(t), the chemical enrichment law Z(t), the initial mass
function IMF, and a function $\beta(f,q)$, controlling the fraction
$f$ and mass ratio distribution $q$ of binary stars. We analyze a set
of $\simeq$ 50 combinations of four Z(t), three IMF and more than four
$\beta(f,q)$. For each of them, the best SFR(t) is searched for among
$\simeq 6 \times 10^7$ models. The comparison between the observed CMD
and the model CMDs is done through $\chi^2_{\nu}$ minimization of the
differences in the number of stars in a set of regions of the CMD,
chosen to sample stars of different ages or in specific stellar
evolutionary phases. We empirically determine the range of
$\chi^2_{\nu}$ values that indicate acceptable models for our set of
data using tests with models with known SFHs.

Our solution for the SFH of Leo I defines a minimum of $\chi^2_{\nu}$
in a well defined position of the parameter space, and the derived
SFR(t) is robust, in the sense that its main characteristics are
unchanged for different combinations of the remaining
parameters. However, only a narrow range of assumptions for Z(t), IMF
and $\beta(f,q)$ result in a good agreement between the data and the
models, namely: Z=0.0004, a Kroupa et al. (1993) IMF or slightly
steeper, and a relatively large fraction of binary stars, with
$f=0.3-0.6$, $q>0.6$ and approximately flat IMF for the secondaries,
or particular combinations of these parameters that would produce a
like fraction of similar mass binaries. Most star formation activity
(70\% to 80\%) occurred between 7 and 1 Gyr ago. At 1 Gyr ago, it
abruptly dropped to a negligible value, but seems to have been active
until at least $\simeq 300 $ million years ago. Our results don't
unambiguously answer the question of whether Leo I began forming stars
around 15 Gyr ago, but it appears that the amount of this star
formation, if existing at all, would be small.

The existence of dwarf spheroidal galaxies with high internal velocity
dispersions orbiting in the Milky Way raises questions about their
dark matter content and lifetime. In this paper, we present an
alternative solution to the dark matter dominated satellites proposed
by Ibata \& Lewis (1998) for the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy.  We
performed simulations of two kinds of N-body satellites: the first
models (f-models) could correspond to satellites with high dark matter
content and they represent initially isolated models. The second
models (s-models) have either low or negligible dark matter content
and they are constructed in a tidal field.  In spite of being on the
same orbits, the s-models are able to produce a better agreement with
some observational constraints concerning Sagittarius.  From our
simulations, we can also infer that Sagittarius is in the process of
being disrupted.

We present $BV$ photometry of the Sculptor dwarf galaxy to $V=22$.
These data give evidence for a bimodality in Sculptor's metallicity
distribution based on a discontinuity in the luminosities of
horizontal branch (HB) stars and by the presence of two distinct red
giant branch (RGB) bumps.  A consistent picture of the evolved stars
in Sculptor is given by the presence of (1) a metal-poor population of
${\rm F/H} \sim -2.3$ with an exclusively blue HB and that corresponds
to the blueward side of the Sculptor RGB and the more luminous RGB
bump, and (2) a less metal-poor population of ${\rm F/H} \sim -1.5$
required to explain the less luminous red HB, the red side of the RGB,
and a second, less luminous bump on the RGB.  Best fits to the HB
populations are obtained with enhanced oxygen abundances, ${\rm O/H}
\sim +0.5$.  Variations in the global HB and RGB morphology of
Sculptor can be explained by differences in the radial distribution of
these two populations.  The presence of these two populations shows
that the Sculptor dwarf galaxy has an {\it internal} second parameter
problem.

A remarkably small scatter in the N/O ratios for the HII regions in
low-metallicity blue compact galaxies (BCG) has been found
recently. It lead to the conclusion that N and O are both produced by
massive stars.  Conversely, the N/Si ratios in damped Ly$\alpha$
absorbers (DLA) show a large scatter. This result provides support for
the time-delay model of nitrogen production in intermediate-mass
stars, nitrogen production in massive stars being not required. The
goal of this study is to test whether these observational data are
compatible with each other and with the existing ideas on the chemical
evolution of galaxies.

We find that it is possible to reconcile the constancy of N/O ratios
in low-metallicity BCGs and the scatter of N/Si ratios in DLAs under
the following three assumptions: {\it 1}) a significant part of
nitrogen is produced by intermediate-mass stars, {\it 2}) star
formation in BCGs and DLAs occurs in bursts separated by quiescent
periods, {\it 3}) the previous star formation events are responsible
for measured heavy element abundances of HII regions in BCGs.

Since the reality of low N/Si ratios in DLAs is not beyond question,
the possibility that the nitrogen in low-metallicity BCGs has been
produced by massive stars cannot be rejected without additional
observations.

>From a rediscussion of Local Group membership, and of distances to
individual galaxies, we obtain $M_V$ values for 35 probable and
possible Local Group members. The luminosity function of these objects
is well fitted by a Schechter function with faint end slope $\alpha =
-1.1 \pm 0.1$. The probability that the luminosity distribution of the
Local Group is a single Schechter function with $\alpha$ steeper than
$-1.3$ is less than 1 per cent.  However, more complicated luminosity
functions, such as multi-component Schechter functions with steep
faint-end slopes, cannot be ruled out. There is some evidence that the
luminosity distribution of dwarf spheroidal galaxies in the Local
Group is steeper than that of dwarf irregular galaxies.

CCD images of three newly discovered dwarf spheroidal companions to

profiles and total magnitudes. Using distance moduli provided by
Armandroff et al. (1998 \& 1999) and Grebel \& Guhathakurta (1999),
these galaxies are shown to have similar luminosities to other Local
Group dwarf spheroidals; And\,V in particular is similar to Draco \&
UMi in luminosity, i.e., among the faintest known. In the
luminosity--metallicity relation, And\,V is shown to have a
significantly higher metallicity than expected.

We present the discovery of a giant molecular complex (r\,=\,350\,pc,
M$_{\rm vir} = 10^7$\,\Msun) in the tidal arms south--east of
NGC\,3077, a member of the M\,81 triplet.  The complex is clearly
detected in the $^{12}$CO (J$=1 \rightarrow 0$) transition at five
independent positions. The position relative to NGC\,3077, the
systemic velocity (V$_{\rm hel} = 14$ \kms) and the cloud averaged
line width (15 \kms) indicate that the object is not related to
Galactic cirrus but is extragalactic. The tidal HI arm where the
molecular complex is located has a total HI mass of M$_{\rm HI} = 3
\times 10^8$\,\Msun. This tidal material was presumably stripped off
the outer parts of NGC\,3077 during the closest encounter with M\,81,
about $3 \times10^8$ years ago. After the complex detected along a
torn--out spiral arm of M\,81 by Brouillet et al., it is the second of
its kind reported so far. Based on published optical observations, we
have no evidence for on--going star formation in the newly detected
molecular complex. Since the system has all the ingredients to form
stars in the future, we speculate that it might eventually resemble
the young dwarf galaxies in the M\,81 group.

Supernova and multiple supernova events regulate several structural
properties of dwarf galaxies. In particular, they govern the metal
enrichment and the energy budget of the ISM; they might induce partial
(blowout) or total (blowaway) gas removal from the galaxy; they also
regulate the pressure of the ISM and consequently the shape of the
galactic gaseous body.  Significant amounts of dark matter may play an
equally important role: the dark matter gravitational potential tends
to concentrate baryons towards the center, thus enhancing both the
star formation rate and metal production. Also, the dynamical
properties of the ISM, and the occurrence of a blowout or blowaway are
shown to be determined by the dark matter content.  We present
detailed analytical/numerical models describing the evolution of dwarf
Irregular galaxies including the above and other effects.  The main
results are: {\it (i)} dwarfs with total masses $M < 5 \times
10^6~M_\odot$ are blown away; those with gas masses up to $\simeq
10^9~M_\odot$ lose mass in an outflow; {\it (ii) } metallicities are
found to correlate tightly with dark matter content and are consistent
with a range of dark-to-visible mass ratios $\phi\approx 0-30 $ with
about 65\% of the dwarfs in the sample having $\phi\approx 0-10$; {\it
(iii)} we predict a lower limit to the oxygen abundance in dIs of
$12+log(O/H)\approx 7.2$ {\it (iv)} outflows are not particularly
important for the evolution of the metal content of dwarf galaxies and
certainly less than star formation for gas consumption; however,
dwarfs with masses $\approx 10^8$~$M_\odot$ are shown to be the major
pollutants of the IGM; {\it (v)} the ISM HI velocity dispersion
correlates with metallicity and, independently of dark matter, scales
as $Z^{3.5}$.  Specific comparisons with well studied galaxies, as for
example the dI Leo A, yield excellent agreement with the data. Based
on our results, we discuss a scenario in which late type and early
type dwarfs had common progenitors in the past, but differences in
their total mass forced these objects to follow different evolutionary
paths. Therefore, we consider dI $\rightarrow$ dE transitions
occurring at present cosmic times as very unlikely.

We have completed a 21-cm survey of a 600 square degree region of the
Centaurus A group of galaxies at a redshift of $\sim$500 km s$^{-1}$
as part of a larger survey of the entire southern sky.  This group of
galaxies was recently the subject of a separate and thorough optical
survey (C{\^o}t{\'e} et al.\ 1997), and thus presented an ideal
comparison for us to test the survey performance.  We have identified
10 new group members to add to the 21 already known in our survey
area. Six of the new members are previously uncatalogued galaxies,
while four were catalogued but assumed not to be group members.
Including the 7 known members outside of our survey area, this brings
the total known number of Cen A members to 38.  All of the new H{\sc
i} detections have optical counterparts, most being intrinsically very
faint (M$_{B} >$ -13.0), late-type low surface brightness dwarfs.
Most of the new members have H{\sc i} masses only a few times our
survey limit of 10$^{7}$ M$_{\odot}$ at an assumed distance for the
group of 3.5 Mpc, and are extremely gas-rich, with a median
M$_{HI}$/L$_B >$ 1.  Our limiting H{\sc i} sensitivity was actually
slightly worse than the H{\sc i} follow-up observations of the
C{\^o}t{\'e} et al.\ optical survey, yet {\it we have already
increased the known number of group members by 50\% using an {\rm
H}{\sc i} survey technique.  } While we have increased the known {\it
number} of members by $\sim$50\%, these new members contribute $<$4\%
to its light.

Using the nearby Blue Compact Dwarf galaxy (BCD)
VII~Zw~403 as example, we illustrate three methods 
to place ages on the {\bf old} stellar
populations of spatially resolved starburst systems:\\
{\bf 1.}~integrated color gradients and population synthesis,\\
{\bf 2.}~integrated spectral line gradients,\\
{\bf 3.}~single-star colors and position-dependent color-magnitude
diagrams (CMD).\\
The first technique is most frequently used to date BCDs but
is also the most ambiguous;
the second one has not been used widely although it has great
potential for systematic dating of large samples of BCDs using 
ground-based spectroscopy
(see the contributions on Elliptical galaxies in this
volume); the third one, owing to the large distances of BCDs, 
requires space-borne data and can only be exploited to its fullest 
with imagers that allow for both high spatial resolution and deep 
limiting magnitudes in the visual and near IR.

We present F110W, F160W ($\sim$ J,~H) color-magnitude diagrams for
VII~Zw~403, DDO~64, I~Zw~36, NGC~4214, and Mkn~178. The red giant
branch (RGB) is detected in all the galaxies. This indicates that
intermediate-age and/or old stars are present and provides a lower
limit of 1-2 Gyr for the age of this population. In spite of the low
metallicities detected in the gas ionized by the starburst, we find
these are not primeval galaxies.

We are currently performing a new analysis of the close environment of
star--forming dwarf galaxies and its effects on their star--forming
activity.  For a sample of 142 thoroughly studied objects, we search
the NASA Extragalactic Database for possible companion galaxies of any
apparent luminosity and angular size.  From a first analysis of a part
of our sample, we find only about 50\% of our objects to be isolated
in the sense that no companion object was detected within a redshift
difference of 500\,km\,s$^{-1}$ and an angular separation
corresponding to a projected distance of 1\,Mpc, assuming
H$_0\,=\,75$\,km\,s$^{-1}$\,Mpc$^{-1}$.  By splitting the sample into
different redshift intervals, we demonstrate an observational bias
against low--luminosity companion objects which implies that a large
fraction of star--forming dwarf galaxies, although lacking bright
companions, may possess dwarf companion objects.
Analogous to other authors, we find no evidence for a difference of
the star--forming activity due to the presence or absence of possible
companions.

We are currently analyzing image data for a large sample of Blue
Compact Dwarf Galaxies (BCDs), obtained in a set of optical broad--
and narrow band filters.  We present preliminary results of a
multi--band analysis of two typical BCDs, Mkn\,5 and I\,Zw\,123,
including surface brightness-- and color profiles, as well as
spatially resolved color-- and H$\alpha$ equivalent width maps, and
show how a combination of this data allows a separate analysis of the
young and old stellar populations with respect to their colors and
spatial distributions.
By comparing the derived colors to the predictions of evolutionary
synthesis models, we estimate ages of the distinct stellar
populations.
The surface brightness profiles of Mkn\,5 show an exponential decay at
large photometric radii, with slopes comparable to those typically
derived for BCDs.  The surface brightness profile of the underlying
component of the ultracompact object I\,Zw\,123 can be described by
both an exponential and an R$^{1/4}$ law.  We briefly discuss how
noise effects can influence the observed slope of surface brightness
profiles at low surface brightness levels.  For compact objects with
extended starbursts, the study of the underlying stellar population
can thereby be rendered difficult.

Because of their low gravitational energies dwarf galaxies are greatly
exposed to energetical influences by the interstellar medium, like
e.g.\ stellar radiation, winds or explosions, or by their
environment. While the metallicity depletion in dwarf galaxies can be
explained in general by supernova-driven galactic winds, the reason
for their low N/O ratios at low O abundance is not yet completely
understood. Stellar yields enrich the different gas phases with
elements that are characteristic for their stellar
progenitors. Gas-phase transitions are necessary for a mixing of
elements, but depend sensitively on the thermal and dynamical state of
the interstellar medium. Models of chemical evolution start usually
with a high N/O ratio at low O abundance according to a metal
enrichment by ancient stellar populations with traditional yields, but
can only reproduce the N/O-O peculiarity by the stepwise element
release and mostly by the application of multiple starbursts in order
to account also for a selective element reduction by galactic winds.

Chemodynamical models of dwarf galaxies, however, demonstrate that
strong evaporation of clouds by the hot supernova gas leads to an
almost perfect mixing of the interstellar gas and a large-scale
homogenization of abundance ratios. In addition, even with
star-formation self-regulation these models can successfully account
for the observed N/O-O values in a self-consistent way. Although new
stellar yields have been taken into account which provide mainly
secondary N production from massive stars, a significant discrepancy
remains between the chemodynamical dwarf galaxy models and closed-box
models that take the chemodynamical treatment into account.  In this
paper we therefore discuss to what amount gas infall is responsible to
affect the N/O ratio.

We present new BR photometry of the Local Group dSph Ursa Minor from
the Wide Field Camera (WFC) at the INT (2.5m) at the Roque de los
Muchachos Observatory (Canary Islands).
The [$B-R$, $"V"$] color magnitude diagram (CMD) for the central body
of the galaxy shows a prominent narrow RGB suggesting a small
metallicity range in the stellar population. In addition, a well
populated, blue extended horizontal branch and several ($\sim$ 150)
stars in the RR Lyrae gap region are observed. Perhaps the most
streaking feature is the well populated {\it blue plume}. A simple
explanation is that it would be made of blue stragglers, but it
contains three times more stars than low central density Galactic
globular clusters. This perhaps indicates that the {\it blue-plume} is
the trace of an intermediate-age population.
 We have done a preliminary estimate of the star formation history for
the central body of UMi assuming that the {\it blue stars} present in
the CMDs are not blue-stragglers but an intermediate-age
population. We find that, after $\sim 12$ Gyr ago, a low star
formation activity extended until a recent epoch is enough to produce
the observed {\it blue plume}.
Finally, we present our preliminary results on our searching for tidal
tails in the periphery of UMi. No traces of the galaxy are found in
two fields outside its tidal radius. The lack of traces beyond the
tidal radius may indicate the absence of extra-tidal stellar debris
and suggests that UMi would not be in an advanced state of tidal
disruption.

Sagittarius, the nearest external galaxy, will be amenable to detailed
abundance studies with VLT and other 8m class telescopes.  Such data,
in conjunction with the similar data of our own galaxy, will allow a
deeper understanding of chemical evolution.  Our study conducted with
NTT shows the presence of metal-rich stars with radial velocities
compatible with Sagittarius membership and of stars as metal-poor as
$\rm [Fe/H]=-1.5$.  In this talk I shall address the way in which VLT
instruments will allow to clarify this intricate situation.  \par
