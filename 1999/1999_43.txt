	Dear VLA User:

	As most of you are aware, the NRAO is developing plans to
significantly improve the capabilities of the Very Large Array.  By
implementing modern technology, we can, at quite modest cost, increase
by typically by an order of magnitude all key instrumental
characteristics of the array, while keeping operational costs near
current levels.  If all parts of the VLA Upgrade plans are
implemented, the resulting capabilities of the array would be
summarized as follows:

	1) Complete frequency tunability between 50 MHz and 50 GHz,
with selectable bandwidths of up to 8 GHz (per polarization).  

	2) The ability to simultaneously observe up to 8 independent
frequency/bandwidth combinations (4 with dual polarization) within one
or two frequency bands. (The total instantaneous bandwidth over all 
channels will be as high as 16 GHz).

	3) RMS sensitivity (12 hours, full bandwidth) of better than 1
microJy between 2 and 40 GHz.

	4) A new correlator which would provide up to 32768 channels.
These can be apportioned out amongst the various frequency and
polarization combinations in an extremely flexible manner.

	5) A new configuration (A+) which would provide about ten
times better resolution than A-configuration.  The new antennas
comprising this configuration can be used in real time with the
current VLA (in which case the point-source sensitivity will be the
same as that quoted in (3) above), or can run be used as a real-time
stand-alone array, (in which case the point-source sensitivity will be
about the same as the current VLA), or can be linked in with the VLBA
antennas to greatly increase that array's sensitivity, flexibility, and
imaging capability.  

	6) A new short-spacing configuration (E) which will increase
by about a factor of five the low-surface brightness sensitivity of
the array over the exising 'D' configuration.  

	A complete description of the goals of the VLA Upgrade will be
found at: http://www.nrao.edu/vla/Upgrade/whatisit.shtml.

      As part of our preparations for presentation of the VLA Upgrade
plan to the radio panel of the decadal review, we are collecting
examples of outstanding new science that these major improvements can
be expected to enable.  These examples will be critical in helping
convince panel members -- both on the radio panel and on the main
panel, that the VLA Upgrade represents outstanding science potential
at modest cost.  

You can help us by answering the following question:

    *******************************************************
    * If the instrument described above were available to *
    * you today, what use would you make of it? What      *
    * key science projects would you propose to do which  *
    * you cannot do now with the current instrument?      *
    *******************************************************

Please respond by the end of this month, so we can select the best
ideas for presentation to the radio panel at their Feb 19/20 meeting.

Send your response by Jan. 31 to Michael Rupen:  mrupen@nrao.edu.

If you have any questions about the Upgrade, please contact
me:    rperley@nrao.edu.

Thank you for your help.  

       Rick Perley
