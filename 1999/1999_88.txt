National Astronomical Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences
(NAOCAS) aim to administrate and operate the major astronomical
equipment located in the mainland of China, which are
opening to astronomers over the country and the world, and program the
construct of the new astronomical equipment. NAOCAS will also select and
finiacially support a number of research
groups, which carry on the substantial projects in astronomy and
astrophysics, in the individual astronomical observatories and the joint
research centers established with universities.
=A0
The NAOCAS will enhance the research fund for the selected research
groups, which will improve the scientific creativity of Chinese
astronomers. The NAOCAS will also improve the operation of
the astronomical equipment, and will strengthen the construct of the new
astronomical equipment, such as LAMOST project.
=A0
The NAOCAS will not only develop the existing collaborations among the
observatories in China, but also make effort to promote the relationship
with observatories and institutions over the
world.
