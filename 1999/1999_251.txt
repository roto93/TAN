Subject: Support Scientist Positions at JIVE

Dear VLBIers, 
             could you please post this advert at your institute or 
bring it to the attention of anyone suitably qualified, who might 
be interested. 

Thanks in advance, 

Mike. 


           THE JOINT INSTITUTE FOR VLBI IN EUROPE (JIVE)
 
      is seeking two candidates for fixed-term appointments as
 
          SUPPORT SCIENTISTS FOR THE EUROPEAN VLBI NETWORK
 
         to be located at JIVE, Dwingeloo, The Netherlands. 
 
 The Joint Institute for VLBI in Europe (JIVE) is operating an advanced
 16-station MkIV-standard VLBI data processor (correlator) to support
 VLBI astronomical observations made with the European VLBI Network
 (EVN). The EVN is often linked to the MERLIN interferometer in the UK,
 the Very Long Baseline Array in the US and the VSOP Space VLBI
 satellite HALCA. Further information regarding JIVE and the EVN can be
 obtained from www.jive.nl/jive.
 
 Applications are invited for two JIVE Support Scientist positions.
 JIVE is located in Dwingeloo, in the Netherlands, at the headquarters
 of the Netherlands Foundation for Research in Astronomy (the host
 institute for JIVE). Two support scientist positions will become
 available in February 2000, one in the EVN Support Group and one in
 the Data Processor Science Operations group.  The appointees will be
 expected to spend 50% of their time on support duties and the
 remaining time on astronomical research.  Support duties within the
 EVN Support Group may include helping EVN users to schedule and
 analyse VLBI data; monitoring and improving the performance of the
 network, via, for example, the correlation and analysis of regular
 Network Monitoring experiments, maintenance of the JIVE computing user
 environment. The responsibilities for the support scientist working in
 the data processor group include evaluation of data quality, contact
 with users on their projects and testing new correlator modes. Both
 positions may also involve some other local service responsibilities.
 
 A Ph.D. in astronomy, astrometry or geodesy, together with a thorough
 knowledge of the VLBI technique, and the ability to communicate well
 with colleagues, are required. Applicants of any nationality are
 eligible to apply.
 
 The appointments are offered for one year in the first instance with
 the possibility of an extension up to a total of three years. The
 appointees will be in the formal employ of the Netherlands
 Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) with a minimum gross salary
 of 64000 Dfl per annum (salary scale 10, level four; the appointment
 may be made at a higher level depending on age and experience).
 Relocation expenses and assistance with finding accomodation will be
 provided.
 
 Please send your application to Prof. R.T. Schilizzi, Director, Joint
 Institute for VLBI in Europe, Postbus 2, 7990 AA, Dwingeloo, The
 Netherlands by 31 January 2000, quoting ref. No. JIVE2000/02.
 Applications should include a curriculum vitae and list of
 publications.  Applicants should also arrange for three letters of
 reference to be sent to the same address by 4 February 2000. Further
 information can be obtained from Dr. M.A. Garrett (EVN Support Group,
 garrett@jive.nl) and Dr. H.J. van Langevelde (Data Processor Science
 Operations Group, langevelde@jive.nl).
