     TITLE:   "THE OUTFLOW PHENOMENON --- 
 			ARE GALAXIES EVAPORATING?"
                       
     ABSTRACT:	Galaxy outflows have been observed from the early days 
 		of radio astronomy in the form of powerful jets from 
 		the nuclei of elliptical galaxies.  In the 1980s, similar 
 		but smaller features were observed in some spiral galaxies, 
 		most notably the Seyferts.  Now, evidence is mounting that 
 		gaseous outflows may be quite common in star forming 
 		galaxies.  These outflows appear to originate from the 
 		disk and may be related to underlying active regions.  
 		However,  the energies required to produce some of the 
 		observed features appear to be prohibitively large.  The 
 		fate of the gas is simlarly uncertain -- does the gas cycle 
 		through the halo and return to the disk, or does it leave 
 		the galaxy altogether, enriching the intergalactic medium 
 		in the process?  This talk will summarize the observational 
 		evidence for galaxy outflows and discuss some possible 
 		causes and consequences.
