                        SECOND ANNOUNCEMENT



  Dear Colleague,
 
  Where is Population III? Do we know candidate stars or galaxies that
belong to it? How did Pop III structures and objects form? How did they
evolve? 
  There are many unsolved questions concerning the earliest stars in the
Universe, but the field is growing quickly and a great effort is spent to
find answers.
  It is for this reason that the European Southern Observatory and 
the Max-Planck Institute for Astrophysics are organizing a 3-day
workshop on ``The First Stars'', to be held in Garching,
Wednesday-Friday August 4-6, 1999.

  The aim of the workshop is to summarize the state of knowledge
about the metal-free (or Pop.III) stars, their existence, formation,
evolution, and their relation to primordial structure formation and
early galaxy evolution.

  The organizers would be happy to bring together in this meeting,
experts from all fields connected with the earliest generation of
stars, to make it a lively place to exchange and combine their ideas
and results.


                                 The SOC/LOC of "The First Stars".

PS: only 5 days after the meeting the total solar eclipse will be 
    visible from Garching (see below)

PPS: please communicate this mail to other colleagues who might
     be interested in this subject



Topics covered:

-Searches for Pop. III stars. Characteristics of stars known
-Observed abundance patterns in ultra metal-poor stars
-Theoretical abundance predictions for very metal-poor stars
-Stellar evolution at zero, and very low metallicities
-First structure formation
-Star formation at very low metallicities
-Abundance patterns in QSO-absorption lines
-Dwarf galaxies as possible first galaxies
-Galaxy formation

Review speakers: T. Beers, V. Castellani, C. Chiosi,
M. Mateo, K. Nomoto, M. Norman, F. Palla, M. Pettini, S. Ryan,
F. Spite, S.D.M. White

We plan 7 invited reviews of 40+5 minutes, 4 invited reviews of 30+5
minutes, 10 targeted talks of 25+5 minutes, 15 contributed talks of
15+5 minutes, 2 dedicated poster sessions and a final panel discussion.

Targeted and contributed talks will be selected after the registration
deadline by the SOC from among the talks proposed.

Proceedings will be published in ESO's proceedings series.

Venue & Accommodation:
#####################

The conference will be held at ESO (the Auditorium for the talks) and
MPA (Poster Session), which are located about 15 minutes walking
distance outside of Garching, which is located 15 km north of Munich.

Accommodation will be in hotels in Garching; see the list on our webpage.  
At this moment we have made pre-reservations for 70 persons. Prices
hardly differ between hotels and range from DM 120-125 for single
occupancy, to DM 160-180 for double occupancy (per night). If you
should have a preference for a specific hotel you can indicate
this when registering.



Registration:
#############

The registration fee is set to 200,- DM (approx. 120 $).  Registration
closes on 31st May 1999. The registration fee will cover: A copy of
the proceedings, coffee/tea/cookies during the breaks, a welcome
reception, and transport from Garching to ESO in the morning and after
the last session of the day.

You can register by filling out the appropriate form on our
homepage:   http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/~stars/
or by returning the form below.

You may pay using the following means (NO credit cards can be accepted):

Limited financial support may be available to a few individuals, and
you can indicate any need when registering.



The SOLAR ECLIPSE on August 11th:
#################################

As you may know, on August 11, 1999 there will be a solar eclipse
visible in parts of Europe. As it so happens, the eclipse is total and
almost of maximum duration in Garching (2min 19sec). Probability for
clear sky is about 50%.  We imagine that some of you want to take
this opportunity to stay a few more days, and on the registration form
you can indicate this. At this moment, an extended stay is possible
only in one of the three hotels we have made pre-reservation (single
room: DM 120, doubles: DM 180 per night)
