CAST 2007 Statistics 

The CAST 2007 meeting concluded last weekend.  As I gathered from many of 
you, it was a successful meeting, with more than 140 participants.  The 
NCKU LOC team led by Alfred Chen did a wonderful job to support the 
activities and to entertain the crowd.  The program itself was full of 
good talks and posters.  The ALMA town meeting was well attended.  On 
behalf of the SOC, I would like to thank you all to make it a worthwhile 
event.  

Among the participants, excluding the vendors for the telescopes and 
books, there are 135 "astronomers", out of which 60 are students.  The 
number of participants from each institution is 50 (NCU), 24 (IAA), 
24 (K-12 teachers and non-affiliated members), 15 (NTHU), 13 (NTNU), 
7 (NCKU), and 2 (TKU).  

Cheers, 

Wen Ping
