Dear Colleague,

Please distribute the following announcement to any potentially
interested undergraduate student.

*** PhD Position on Astrophysics - Granada, Spain ***

The Instituto de Astrofisica de Andalucia, based in Granada, Spain
(IAA-CSIC, http://www.iaa.es/) offers one four-year PhD fellowship within
the frame of the project "Studies using the VLBI technique: Active
Galactic Nuclei and radio supernovae". Drs. Antxon Alberdi (antxon@iaa.es)
and Miguel A. Perez-Torres (torres@iaa.es) will both be advisors of the
fellow.

The main goal of the thesis project is the determination of the dominant
dust heating mechanism (AGN, starburst, or both) in the nuclear and
circumnuclear regions of a sample of nearby (20< D/Mpc < 350), Luminous
Infrared Galaxies (LIRGs), in the range of L_fir ~7E10 to 2E12 L_solar.
The project will make extensive use of multi-wavelength, high- resolution,
radio interferometric observations taken with the VLA, MERLIN, and the EVN
rrays. The existing observing campaigns should allow the detection of
radio supernovae, aimed at directly determining the star-formation of
massive stars in the galaxies of the sample. The results of the thesis
project will also serve as a basis to extend those studies to the lower
end of Far InfraRed luminosities, thanks to the upcoming high-sensitivity
arrays, like the e-VLA and e-MERLIN.

Our research group keeps regular collaborations with other international
centres. In addition, the IAA-CSIC offers an excellent research
atmosphere, with more than 80 researchers (staff, postdocs, and graduate
students). The selected candidate is also encouraged to initiate
collaborations with other members of the Institute that might complement
and enrich his/her research.

The gross salary of the fellowship will be around 1200 EUR/month for the
first two years, while the last two years will be of about 1300 EUR/month,
subject to tax and Social Security deductions. Medical insurance under the
Spanish Health Service is provided. Granada is a relatively cheap city,
and the main expenses come from renting an apartment (a two/three bedroom
apartment costs about 500 EUR/month), but most grad students of the
IAA-CSIC share flats, which downsizes accommodation expenses to a maximum
of 200-250 EUR/month.

The deadline to send the short list of candidates is set by the end of
January 2007, and the selected candidate will start his/her work no later
than September 2007. For this reason, we advise any potentially interested
candidate to contact as soon as possible with Antxon Alberdi
(antxon@iaa.es) and Miguel A. Perez-Torres (torres@iaa.es), and send them
his/her CV in electronic format.

With best regards,
Miguel A. Perez Torres & Antxon Alberdi
