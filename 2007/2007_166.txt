Postdoctoral Positions in High Energy Astrophysics and Star and Planet 
Formation
Institute of Astronomy, National Tsing Hua University

The Institute of Astronomy at National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan, 
invites applications for postdoctoral research positions in high-energy 
astrophysics and star and planet formation. The successful candidates 
will work with faculty members of the institute including Hsiang-Kuang 
Chang, Huei-Ru Chen, Dean-Yi Chou, Ing-Guey Jiang, Albert Kong, and 
Shih-Ping Lai. Their research activities involve theoretical 
investigations and observations in various wavebands with facilities 
like Chandra, XMM, Integral, RXTE, Suzaku, Hubble, Spitzer, SMA, etc. 
On-going instrumentation projects include the Nuclear Compton Telescope 
(NCT) in collaboration with UCB/SSL, and an optical observing network 
for exoplanet transit. The postdoctoral scholars will be encouraged to 
develop new initiatives in-line with their own research interests. 
Applicants must have a PhD in relevant research fields. The appointment 
will be for two years initially, and will likely be renewed for 
additional years depending on performance and continued funding.

Applicants should submit a curriculum vitae, a list of publications, and 
a statement of research interests to hkchang@phys.nthu.edu.tw. 
<mailto:hkchang@phys.nthu.edu.tw.> Applicants should also make 
arrangements for three letters of recommendation to be sent directly to 
Prof. Hsiang-Kuang Chang, Institute of Astronomy, National Tsing Hua 
University, Hsinchu 30013, Taiwan. Letters of recommendation can be sent 
via e-mail. Applications received by January 31, 2008 will receive full 
consideration, but the positions will remain open until filled.
