Invited talk at PSSC, NCKU

Speaker : Prof. Sun Kwok (Chair Professor of Physics and Dean of Science,
University of Hong Kong)

Title: Atomic, Molecular, and Solid-State Radiation Processes in the
Interstellar Medium

Time: 2007/06/01 (Fri) 10:00 AM

Location: R203, NCTS, NCKU (Tainan)

Abstract:
The recent development of observing capabilities in the x-ray, UV,
infrared, and submillimeter parts of the electromagnetic spectrum,
especially through observations from space, has identified many
radiation processes not possible in the terrestrial environment. The low
density of interstellar space has allowed the emission of photons from
metstable states of atoms and ions, as well as from unstable molecular
species such as radicals. There are also a number of unidentified
features that may have their origin in nanoparticles.
In this talk, we will present an overview of modern astronomical
observations from the radio to the x-ray, and discuss the implication
these observations on physics and chemistry.
