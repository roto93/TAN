Invited talk at PSSC, NCKU

Speaker : Prof. Sun Kwok (Chair Professor of Physics and Dean of Science, 
University of Hong Kong)

Title: Atomic, Molecular, and Solid-State Radiation Processes in the 
Interstellar Medium 

Time: 2007/06/01 (Fri) 10:00 AM 

Location: R203, NCTS, NCKU (Tainan)

Abstract:
The recent development of observing capabilities in the x-ray, UV, 
infrared, and submillimeter parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, 
especially through observations from space, has identified many 
radiation processes not possible in the terrestrial environment. The low 
density of interstellar space has allowed the emission of photons from 
metstable states of atoms and ions, as well as from unstable molecular 
species such as radicals. There are also a number of unidentified 
features that may have their origin in nanoparticles. 

In this talk, we will present an overview of modern astronomical 
observations from the radio to the x-ray, and discuss the implication 
these observations on physics and chemistry.
