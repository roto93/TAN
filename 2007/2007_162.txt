National Central University
Panoramic Survey Telescope & Rapid Response System
(Pan-STARRS) Project Post-Doctoral Position Opening
---------------------------------------------------------------

Department:
Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering
& Graduate Institute of Astronomy, National Central University


Location:
National Central University, JhongLi City, Taiwan


Application deadline: 12/31/2007


How to apply:
Please send your curriculum vitae, reference list, and other
related materials to wjwang@csie.ncu.edu.tw. Please include
the phrase "NCU postdoctoral position application" in your e-mail
title. Should you have questions, please contact Project Assistant,
Ting-Chang Yang, by calling +886-3-4227151 ext 65970.

The applicant will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
1. Ph.D. degree in related fields of Computer Science
2. English proficiency in reading/writing/speaking/listening
3. Distributed/Parallel computing background (preferred).
4. Passions in astronomy.


Description:
Panoramic Survey Telescope And Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS)
is a planned astronomical survey which will conduct astrometry and
photometry of 3/4 of the entire sky every night. The major goal of
Pan-STARRS is to detect potentially hazardous objects, in particular
the near-earth objects in the Solar System. At the first stage, the
observed data from Pan-STARRS will be about 2-3 Terabytes per night.
Therefore advanced computing technology, such as grid/p2p computing,
is required to improve performance.

The applicant is expected to do scientific computing research for the
Pan-STARRS project. The job may require traveling to the US, Europe,
or Japan occasionally for interactions with other researchers in the
international Pan-STARRS consortium. The applicant must have a Ph.D.
degree in related areas of computer science. Applicants with strong
passions in distributed scientific computing and astronomy are preferred.
