 Yamamoto are visiting from Japan. On Tuesday (06/26) afternoon, both 
 Sakai-san, Nami and Takeshi, will present a half-hour colloquium on their 
 research work. Nami will give a talk titled "Detection of Negative Ion 
 in Star Forming Regions "; Takeshi will give another one titled "A 
 Survey of Molecular Lines toward Massive Clumps associated with Infrared
 Dark Clouds".

	On Friday (06/29) afternoon, Ms. Pei-Chun Hsu, the winner of the
 JTAM editor Award Award this year, will give a half-hour talk on her 
 article, "Particle Acceleration in Pulsar Magnetospheres". Pei-Chun is
 a former IAA summer students and now a TIARA research assistant. She is
 leaving soon for graduate study in UCSD. Please join us to congradulate
