Dear Friends and Colleagues,
  This is a reminder that the registration and abstract deadline for the EAMA7
meeting in Japan is 25 July 2007
(http://www.naoj.org/Information/News/EAMA7/).  For those planning contributed
oral presentations, please keep in mind that there are a very limited number
of slots of ~10 mins each.  As a consequence, presentations on projects or
group-based research where the impact may be higher is especially encouraged.
  EACOA in Taiwan is looking into the possibility of supporting Taiwan
attendees to this meeting.  If you are in need of financial support, please
let Linda Shao (lshao@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw) known whether you need expenses for
airfare or local accomodations (or both) by 6 August 2007.

sincerely,
jeremy lim, Taiwan SOC Chair for EAMA7
