Dear Colleagues,

The Theoretical Institute for Advanced Research in Astrophysics
(TIARA) and the Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA) of
Academia Sinica will host a workshop in Taipei, Taiwan.

Title of the Workshop - From Chemistry to Life

Date: Dec. 3 (Mon.) -- Dec. 7 (Fri.)

Workshop Venue: ASIAA Room 716, in Physics Building, National Taiwan
University, Taipei

Registration deadline: Nov. 23 (no registration fee is required).
Please email sfws07@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw to register.

Discussion Topics within the Workshop

The theme of the workshop is motivated in the general context of Astrobiology,
Origins of Stars and Planetary Systems, and Origins of Life. We would like to
address pressing problems in the general context related to star formation
processes such as, but not limited to, the following topics:

Chemical reactions and evolution in cloud cores, jets/outflows, and disks
Chemistry in shocks
Molecular Chemistry
Biomolecules and Life
Dust grains in the Interstellar Medium and Meteorites
Infrared Spectroscopy and Laboratory Experiments
Chemical reactions related to gas-solid phases and meteoritic evidences

Additionally, we would like to maximize the interactions between our invited
participants from overseas and local astronomers from within the institute and
local universities.

Format for Meeting

The emphasis of this workshop will be on discussions rather than
formal presentations. We will have several talks per day, followed
by discussions and working sessions. Our experience shows that such
a format will encourage interaction and possible collaboration.
Students from within Taiwan are especially welcome to join the
lectures.

Program will be available once we receive all the titles of
presentations from our invited speakers. Please check the web link
frequently for further updates.
