Subject: Pan-STARRS mini-workshop

Dear Yi-Jehng, 

Would you please circulate this information regarding a Pan-STARRS 
mini-workshop on June 14/15?  Thanks.

Wen Ping

A mini-workshop on the Pan-STARRS project will be held on June 14 
(Thursday) and 15 at NCU.  

Nick Kaiser, Ken Chambers, Robert Jedicke (all UH/IfA) and Matt Holman 
(CfA) will come.  The main goal is to hear first-handed about the progress 
of the PS1 and to link up local scientist and students with relevant 
science groups.  There will be a few overview kinds of talks, but by and 
large it is not going to be talk oriented.  Instead, we would interact 
with the PS1 staff regarding how we could make best use of the data and 
how we can contribute to the project.  

More information can be found in our Institute's frontpage 
www.astro.ncu.edu.tw

Thanks.

Wen Ping
