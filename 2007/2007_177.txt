  Dear all,

	This Friday, Prof. Albert Kong at National Tsing-Hua University
  will visit IAA and give a colloquium talk. Prof. Kong joined the  
Institute
  of Astronomy at NTHU very recently. His research focuses on high  
energy
  astrophysics and compact objects, particularly through X-ray  
observations.
  On Friday, he will discuss his work with a talk titled "X-tra Galactic
  Compact Binaries: A Multi-wavelength Approach"

	More information of IAA colloquium talks can be found at our
  colloquium web page,

  Please mark your calendar and remember to join the event!

  Regards,

  sheng-yuan

------------------------ ASIAA Colloquium -------------------------
  Speaker : Prof. Albert Kong (NTHU)
  Title   : X-tra Galactic Compact Binaries:
                 A Multi-wavelength Approach
  Time    : 12/21 (Fri) 2:00 PM
  Location: Rm 716
  Abstract: Chandra and XMM-Newton have improved our understanding
            of X-ray populations in galaxies. These observations
            provide unique information on compact binary systems
            involving black hole, neutron star, or white dwarf
            accretors in the local universe. In particular, there
            exists a class of ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs)
            for which the observed luminosity can be as high as
            ~1e40 erg/s. ULXs are of great interest since they
            represent a population of possible intermediate-mass
            black holes. Moreover, nearby galaxies provide us an
            excellent database to study globular cluster X-ray
            sources which can be used to constrain the formation
            of compact binary systems and may also provide the first
            evidence for the existence of black hole in a globular
            cluster. These exciting results are due in large part
            to multi-wavelength high-resolution observations. In
            this talk, I will review some of the recent X-ray/optical/
            IR/radio observations of nearby galaxies as well as
            future multi-wavelength observing campaigns that NTHU
            is involving.
