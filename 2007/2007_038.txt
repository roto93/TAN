Dear Colleague,

      This is the Second Announcement of the 2nd European Radio
Interferometry School ("ERIS") to be held in Bonn at the
Gustav-Stresemann-Institut (GSI) in September 2007. The school is
sponsored by the EU RadioNet Consortium (within the Sixth Framework
Programme of the European Commission) and by the Max-Planck-Institut
fuer Radioastronomie.

   REGISTRATION IS NOW OPEN via the ERIS web page at:

     http://www.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de/div/eris/index_e.html

The web page also provides details of the school venue, accommodation,
costs, and travel advice.  Reservation of accommodation at the GSI
will be made by the ERIS organisation via registration - participants
should not contact the GSI directly.

   THE DEADLINE FOR REGISTRATION IS   15 JUNE 2007

Local participants not staying at the GSI must also register !

Following registration, participants may be asked later to reconfirm
their intention of attending the school before finalization of the list.

Funds are available to provide financial support for a limited number
of participants.  Details are provided on the Web page.

   THE DEADLINE FOR REQUESTING FINANCIAL SUPPORT is  1 MAY 2007.

Please use the ERIS email address for all enquiries:

      eris2007@mpifr-bonn.mpg.de


AIM OF THE SCHOOL

The purpose of the school is to present the basic principles of radio
interferometry techniques and data analysis, covering general aspects
common to all observations but also specialised topics including high
and low-frequency, polarimetry, spectroscopy and high resolution
(VLBI) observations.  Use of interferometer arrays such as MERLIN,
WSRT, VLA and the European VLBI Network (EVN) will be covered, as well
as introductions to arrays such as ALMA, LOFAR and the SKA which are
under development.

The school is addressed both to potential new users of radio
interferometry, and to astronomers and students already in the field
who wish to broaden their knowledge and skills.  Participation will be
limited to about 70 - 80 people; those who definitely plan to attend
are advised to register well before the deadline as places will be
available on a first come, first served basis.


VENUE, ACCOMMODATION AND COSTS

The school will be held at the Gustav-Stresemann-Institut in Bonn, a
residential Conference Centre which provides on-site accommodation and
meals.

(see:  http://www.gsi-bonn.de/en/tagungszentrum/index.htm)

Participants are expected to stay for the full length of the school
(Monday 10th Sep. morning - Saturday 15th Sep. midday). A block
allocation has been reserved for school participants arriving on the
9th Sep. and leaving on 15th or 16th Sep.  The cost per night for full
board and accommodation will be EUR 78 (single room) or EUR 67 (shared
double room). Reservation of accommodation will be made by the ERIS
organisation via the school registration and participants should not
contact the GSI directly.  Participants should pay their accommodation
costs directly to the GSI on leaving.

There will be no registration fee.

Although we expect most participants to be funded by their
institutes, some financial support will be available for special
cases. The deadline for requests for financial support is 1 MAY
(see the Web page for details). Applicants will be informed of the
ERIS organisers' decision well before the registration deadline.


PROGRAMME OF THE SCHOOL

The school will consist of technical and scientific lectures, computer
demonstrations, question-and-answer sessions and possibly break-out
sessions for smaller groups (depending on the range of the
participants). Special emphasis will be placed on combining lectures
and analysis demonstrations in an integrated way.

A preliminary list of topics includes:

* Introduction to radio astronomy and interferometry
* Introduction to the NRAO AIPS package
* Interferometer reduction techniques and imaging
* Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI)
* Spectral line imaging
* Polarization imaging
* High and low frequency data
* Astrometry
* Use of arrays such as MERLIN, VLA, EVN, ......
* Planning an experiment/observation
* Future instruments and developments

Subject: Searching for Strong Lenses in Large Imaging Surveys (Fermilab,
June 14-15, 2007): Registration Open


Greetings, all,

We would like to announce that registration is now open for the workshop,
"Searching for Strong Lenses in Large Imaging Surveys," to be hosted by the
Fermilab Center for Particle Astrophysics:

Dates:     June 14-15, 2007

The first day of this two-day workshop will be devoted to general topics
presented during plenary sessions.  The second day will be devoted to more
informal parallel sessions, during which short (10-15 min) contributed talks
will be scheduled.  Parallel session topics will include:
   * Current and Future Surveys
   * Search Techniques: Lensed Galaxies
   * Search Techniques: Lensed Quasars
   * Lens Theory and Modeling
   * The Properties of Lensed Galaxies
There will also be time scheduled on the second day for small groups (such
