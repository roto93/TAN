YJ,

Sorry my last message did not have the time and place for the talk.  
Please circulate again.  Thanks a lot.

> The Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS)
> at the University of Hawaii's Institute for Astronomy is a funded
> project to repeatedly survey the entire visible sky to faint limiting
> magnitudes (m_R~24).  It will be composed of four 1.8m diameter
> telescopes each outfitted with fast readout orthogonal transfer
> Giga-pixel CCD cameras.  A prototype telescope (PS1) is scheduled for
> operations early in 2008 with the other telescopes becoming available
> a few years later.  More than 65% of the surveying time will be in a
> mode suitable for the discovery of new solar system objects.  In a  
> single lunation Pan-STARRS will detect about five times more solar  
> system objects than the entire currently known sample.  Within its  
> first year Pan-STARRS will have detected ~20,000 Kuiper Belt Objects
> and by the end of its ten year operational lifetime we expect to have
> found 10^7 Main Belt objects and achieve ~90% observational
> completeness for all NEOs larger than ~300m diameter.  With these data
> in hand Pan-STARRS will revolutionize our knowledge of the contents
> and dynamical structure of the solar sytem.

    Title:  Shaping of protoplanetary nebulae
            and young planetary nebulae

 Abstract: Most stars end their lives the same way as the Sun,
 evolving first into red giants, then asymptotic giant branch
 (AGB) stars surrounded by circumstellar envelopes (CSEs), then
 post-AGB stars with pPNe, and finally into white dwarfs (WDs)
 with PNe. pPNe are the immediate progenitors of PNe and expected
 to evolve into PNe in less than 1000 years. Despite extensive
 studies, the origin and evolution of pPNe and PNe, which are
 the key questions to understanding the mass-loss mechanism during
 the end stages of the stellar evolution, are still uncertain.

 pPNe and PNe are now believed to be produced by collimated fast
 winds (CFWs) or jets. For the first time, we show that CFWs can
 reproduce some of the key features seen in protoplanetary and
 young planetary nebulae that can not be produced before by isotropic
 fast winds. This result changes our current understanding of the
 mass-loss mechanism at the end of the stellar evolution, which is
 assumed to be isotropic. In addition, we find that toroidal magnetic
 field is needed to constrain the jet material in the jet beam in
 order to reproduce the observed morphology and kinematics of the
 jet. This suggests that magnetic field may play a crucial role
 for launching the jet. Also, the observed periodical knots in
 the jet may suggest that the central system is binary.
