Dear Prof. Kuan,

Would you please announce on TAN, thanks in advance.

Lulin One-meter Telescope (LOT) Call for Observing Proposals for 2007B
Proposal Deadline  July 31th, 2007

The Lulin One-meter Telescope (LOT) solicits observing proposals for the 
semester of 2007B.  The new semester begins on September 1st, 2007 and ends 
on February 29th ,2008.

Those who are interested in applying for observing time can download the 
proposal form from the NCU/IA web page:

http://www.lulin.ncu.edu.tw/lot/lot_apply.doc

and submit the proposal to the following email address:

tac_lulin@astro.ncu.edu.tw

with a copy to the TAC chair to avoid occasional erroneous delivery:

	yichou@astro.ncu.edu.tw

by midnight, July 31th, 2007, Taiwan time (UT+8).  The allocation of 
observing time will be announced before August 20th, 2007.  In addition to 
the research proposals, we will also consider educational projects for 
advanced astronomical observation courses.

Instruments Available:

There are two instruments available, the Lulin CCD Imager (LCI) and the 
Lulin Compact Spectrograph (LCS).  The LCI is the major observing instrument 
using the PI-1300B CCD.  The technical information of LCI can be found in 
the following web page:

http://www.lulin.ncu.edu.tw/lot/1300b.pdf

The second instrument, the LCS, has been tested and calibrated during the 
2007A semester.  The calibration of this instrument has been improving but 
has not achieved its expected performance.  Thus observers using this 
instrument are on a shared risk basis.  Users are encouraged to keep in 
close contact with the technical team to receive the updated information.  
Below please find the specifications of LCS:

Lulin Compact Spectrograph (LCS)

Dispersion element: 2 gratings (300 lines/mm and 1200 lines/mm) 
Detector: Apogee AP-8 (SITE chip, 1Kx1K)
Length of slit (projection onto the sky with LOT optics): 8.5 arcmin
Width of slit (projection onto the sky with LOT optics): 1.5 arcsec (fixed)
Resolving power: 333 @ 500nm (300 lines/mm) and 1333 @ 500nm (1200 lines/mm) 
Wavelength coverage: 380-760nm, and 500-900nm (300 lines/mm)   
Calibration lamp: Fe-Ar-Ne
