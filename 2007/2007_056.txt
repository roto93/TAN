 Dear all,

	Next Thursday, we will have a special colloquium talk given by
 Dr. Alwyn Wootten, the ALMA North American project scientist from 
 National Radio Astronomical Observatory (NRAO) in Charlottesville, VA.
 The talk will be titled ""Beyond ALMA's First Fringes"

	As you may know, ALMA reached a major milestone by achieving its 
 first fringes at the ALMA Test Facility at Socorro with prototype antennas
 in early March, and the project continues moving forward quickly. In this 
 talk, Dr. Wootten will give some project progress overview, with an
 emphasis on science. He will also introduce some coming up difficult
 decisions facing the Science group, such as the final adoption of the
 configuration on the site, imaging simulations, and what they might mean
 to future science with ALMA.

	The talk will be held at Dr. Poe Lecture Hall at Institute
 of Atomic and Molecular Sciences (IAMS) on the NTU campus at 2:00PM 
 next Thursday (May 10) afternoon.

	Please notice the SPECIAL TIME and LOCATION of this talk. Mark 
 your calendar and remember to join this special event!

 Regards,

 sheng-yuan

Dear Colleagues,

ALMA-Taiwan Project team will hold the 4th ALMA-Taiwan town meeting
at National Cheng Kung University (NCKU) during the CAST2007 meeting.
All the people, who are interested in the Atacama Large
Millimeter/Submillimeter
Array (ALMA) Project, are invited to the meeting.

Date: June 2, 2007
Time: 18:00-20:00 (start right after the CAST2007 meeting)
Venue: Medical College of National Cheng Kung University
           (1F lecture hall where the CAST2007 meeting will be held.)

ALMA is the largest ground based, international astronomical
observational facility ever built, and is a partnership of North America,
Europe, and Japan in cooperation with the Republic of Chile.
It is currently under construction in the Chajnantor area in the Atacama
desert in northern Chile. ALMA will be studying a broad range of exciting
science, such as weather patterns on solar system planets, the formation
of planets and stars in our galaxy, the motions within active galactic nuclei,
and the formation of the earliest galaxies at z~10. In September 2005,
Taiwan has started a collaboration with ALMA-Japan to participate
in the ALMA Project. At the same time, Taiwan has been exploring
a possibility to collaborate with ALMA-NA, followed by a recent big progress.
You can find some more information on the project
at http://alma.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw.

At the town meeting, we are going to discuss following topics:

-Latest status of the ALMA-Taiwan project
-Science cases and preparation
-User support

We will provide light foods and drinks during the meeting.
If you are interested in attending the meeting, please register on-line at
http://alma.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/activities/CAST/2007/registration.html
by May 25, 2007. For more details, including any suggestions and
omments on the meeting, please feel free to send emails to
Nagayoshi Ohashi (ohashi@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw).

We look forward to seeing all of you at the meeting!

Nagayaoshi Ohashi
ALMA-Taiwan Project Manager
