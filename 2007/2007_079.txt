Dear Yi-Jehng, 

Would you please circulate this information regarding a Pan-STARRS 
mini-workshop on June 14/15?  Thanks.

Wen Ping

A mini-workshop on the Pan-STARRS project will be held on June 14 
(Thursday) and 15 at NCU.  

Nick Kaiser, Ken Chambers, Robert Jedicke (all UH/IfA) and Matt Holman 
(CfA) will come.  The main goal is to hear first-handed about the progress 
of the PS1 and to link up local scientist and students with relevant 
science groups.  There will be a few overview kinds of talks, but by and 
large it is not going to be talk oriented.  Instead, we would interact 
with the PS1 staff regarding how we could make best use of the data and 
how we can contribute to the project.  

More information can be found in our Institute's frontpage 
www.astro.ncu.edu.tw

Thanks.

Wen Ping

Dear Yi-Jehng, 

A possible inclusion in the next TAN.  Thanks.

CAST 2007 Statistics 

The CAST 2007 meeting concluded last weekend.  As I gathered from many of 
you, it was a successful meeting, with more than 140 participants.  The 
NCKU LOC team led by Alfred Chen did a wonderful job to support the 
activities and to entertain the crowd.  The program itself was full of 
good talks and posters.  The ALMA town meeting was well attended.  On 
behalf of the SOC, I would like to thank you all to make it a worthwhile 
event.  

Among the participants, excluding the vendors for the telescopes and 
books, there are 135 "astronomers", out of which 60 are students.  The 
number of participants from each institution is 50 (NCU), 24 (IAA), 
24 (K-12 teachers and non-affiliated members), 15 (NTHU), 13 (NTNU), 
7 (NCKU), and 2 (TKU).  

Cheers, 

Wen Ping
