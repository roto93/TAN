National Central University
Panoramic Survey Telescope & Rapid Response System
(Pan-STARRS) Project Post-Doctoral Position Opening
---------------------------------------------------------------

Department:
Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering
& Graduate Institute of Astronomy, National Central University


Location:
National Central University, JhongLi City, Taiwan


Application deadline: 12/31/2007


How to apply:
Please send your curriculum vitae, reference list, and other
related materials to wjwang@csie.ncu.edu.tw. Please include
the phrase "NCU postdoctoral position application" in your e-mail
title. Should you have questions, please contact Project Assistant,
Ting-Chang Yang, by calling +886-3-4227151 ext 65970.

The applicant will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
1. Ph.D. degree in related fields of Computer Science
2. English proficiency in reading/writing/speaking/listening
3. Distributed/Parallel computing background (preferred).
4. Passions in astronomy.


Description:
Panoramic Survey Telescope And Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS)
is a planned astronomical survey which will conduct astrometry and
photometry of 3/4 of the entire sky every night. The major goal of
Pan-STARRS is to detect potentially hazardous objects, in particular
the near-earth objects in the Solar System. At the first stage, the
observed data from Pan-STARRS will be about 2-3 Terabytes per night.
Therefore advanced computing technology, such as grid/p2p computing,
is required to improve performance.

The applicant is expected to do scientific computing research for the
Pan-STARRS project. The job may require traveling to the US, Europe,
or Japan occasionally for interactions with other researchers in the
international Pan-STARRS consortium. The applicant must have a Ph.D.
degree in related areas of computer science. Applicants with strong
passions in distributed scientific computing and astronomy are preferred.

 	Dr. Cangbom Park from Korea Institute for Advanced Study is
 visiting for the CosPA meeting a couple weeks ago. He will discuss
 his research with a special talk on Wednesday (11/28) afternoon
 titled " How does galaxy morphology change?".

 	Prof. Sato from Tokyo Institute of Technology and Prof. Futamase
 from Tohoku University are both visiting this week as well. Their 
 colloquium talks will be announcement in another message.

	More information of these talks can also be found at our colloquium
  web page - "https://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/act/colloquium.php".
