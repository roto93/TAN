     Title: Neutral gas properties of galaxies:             from the most isolated ones to radio-galaxies


     Abstract:
     The environment of galaxies seems to play a key role in the
     evolution and formation of galaxies. The morphological appearance,
     ISM properties, star formation and nuclear activity are known to be
     conditioned by interactions between galaxies. In order to quantify
     what is the effect of the environment, an unbiased sample of
     galaxies free of interaction and with multiwavelength information is
     needed. To that aim, we are studying a numerous (~1000), well-defined and
     complete sample of isolated galaxies (AMIGA project, http://www.iaa.es/
     AMIGA.html) based on the Catalogue of Isolated Galaxies (Karatchenseva,
     1973) and building a database that currently contains optical
     luminosities, Ha, FIR and NIR, radio-continuum, HI and CO(1-0) information.

     I focus in this talk on the neutral gas (both atomic and molecular)
     properties of these isolated galaxies and compare with other samples
     of nearby galaxies in denser environments where interactions events
     are more likely, such as Hickson compact groups. In particular, I
     will also discuss the mean properties of the neutral gas in nearby
     radio-galaxies and luminous IR galaxies with respect to our new
     reference of very isolated galaxies.
