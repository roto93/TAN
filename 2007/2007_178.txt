                     Union Astronomique Internationale

                     VACANCY ANNOUNCEMENT
                     
                     EXECUTIVE ASSISTANT

The International Astronomical Union (IAU) is looking for a talented, 
self motivated, energetic, enthusiastic and organized individual to fill
the full time position of Executive Assistant reporting to the General
Secretary, who is the Chief Executive of the IAU. The Executive Assistant
has overall responsibility for managing the IAU Secretariat and works
closely with the elected Officers in all matters concerning the running
of the IAU.  The IAU <www.iau.org>, founded in 1919, is a non-government
organization dedicated to the advancement, promotion and understanding of
astronomy in all its aspects through international cooperation. Its 12
Divisions, 40 Commissions and 76 Working/Program Groups cover the whole of
astronomy and astrophysics. As of September 2006, the IAU had over 9700
Individual Members in 87 countries. Of those countries, 64 are National
Members of the IAU.

The IAU Secretariat comprises two full time and two part time staff in the
IAU offices in Paris, plus contracted support staff at ESO in Munich,
Germany. The IAU offices are located within, and share facilities with, the
Institut d^YAstrophysique de Paris.

The Executive Assistant will be expected to carry out the following main
functions:
* Provide support to the General Secretary, including performing special
  projects as assigned;
* Manage the operations of the Secretariat in Paris, including supervising
  an Administrative Assistant;
* Coordinate meetings for the Officers, Executive Committee and other groups,
  including reserving conference space and ordering catering;
* Schedule Executive Committee meetings and prepare related documents;
* Support offsite meetings of the Executive Committee and members, requiring
  occasional travel of 1-2 weeks duration;
* Maintain contacts and communications with senior executives from offices
  around the world;
* Communicate with, and respond to questions and requests from members of
  the IAU;
* Draft and edit correspondence directly and on behalf of the General
  Secretary and other Officers, including letters, agreements and memos;
* Process billing payments/invoices, and maintain financial and budgetary
  records.

The IAU is seeking candidates who can offer the following qualifications:
* Self-motivation and the ability to work independently and reliably, with
  flexibility and initiative;
* The ability to treat information with complete confidentiality, and to
  handle sensitive issues in a tactful and diplomatic manner.
* Full command of written and spoken English and French;
* An effective communication style with the proven ability and experience
  to work successfully with people at all levels of the organization;
* Excellent verbal and written communication skills;
* Excellent interpersonal relation skills;
* Full command of the Microsoft Office software and the facilities of the
  internet;
* Strong organizational skills and proven attention to detail;
* The ability to build and maintain relationships at the senior level;
* Proven flexibility in working practices and multitasking.

Previous experience in and astronomical and/or international environment at
a comparable level would be an advantage. The appointment is expected to
start on 1 February 2009 with an initial probationary period of six months.
A competitive salary will be offered, aligned with similar posts in the
Paris region. Further information may be obtained by writing in confidence
to the General Secretary of the IAU, Dr. K.A. van der Hucht at
<K.A.van.der.Hucht@sron.nl>.

Applications with full CV and names of two references should be addresses
to the General Secretary of the IAU Dr. K.A. van der Hucht at
<K.A.van.der.Hucht@sron.nl> by 31 March 2008. Interviews for short-listed
candidates will be arranged in Paris in July 2008.

  Dear all,

	This Friday, Prof. Albert Kong at National Tsing-Hua University
  will visit IAA and give a colloquium talk. Prof. Kong joined the  
Institute
  of Astronomy at NTHU very recently. His research focuses on high  
energy
  astrophysics and compact objects, particularly through X-ray  
observations.
  On Friday, he will discuss his work with a talk titled "X-tra Galactic
  Compact Binaries: A Multi-wavelength Approach"

	More information of IAA colloquium talks can be found at our
  colloquium web page,
         https://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/act/colloquium.php

  Please mark your calendar and remember to join the event!

  Regards,

  sheng-yuan

------------------------ ASIAA Colloquium -------------------------
  Speaker : Prof. Albert Kong (NTHU)
  Title   : X-tra Galactic Compact Binaries:
                 A Multi-wavelength Approach
  Time    : 12/21 (Fri) 2:00 PM
  Location: Rm 716
  Abstract: Chandra and XMM-Newton have improved our understanding
            of X-ray populations in galaxies. These observations
            provide unique information on compact binary systems
            involving black hole, neutron star, or white dwarf
            accretors in the local universe. In particular, there
            exists a class of ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs)
            for which the observed luminosity can be as high as
            ~1e40 erg/s. ULXs are of great interest since they
            represent a population of possible intermediate-mass
            black holes. Moreover, nearby galaxies provide us an
            excellent database to study globular cluster X-ray
            sources which can be used to constrain the formation
            of compact binary systems and may also provide the first
            evidence for the existence of black hole in a globular
            cluster. These exciting results are due in large part
            to multi-wavelength high-resolution observations. In
            this talk, I will review some of the recent X-ray/optical/
            IR/radio observations of nearby galaxies as well as
            future multi-wavelength observing campaigns that NTHU
            is involving.
