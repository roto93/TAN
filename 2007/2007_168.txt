Dear all,

	We will have a special colloquium talk this Friday (12/07).
  Prof. Paul Ricker is visiting these two weeks from University of
  Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Prof. Ricker's research interests
  include the evolution of galaxies and clusters of galaxies,
  globular clusters, the interstellar medium, and supernova explosions.
  He will present a talk titled "Sources of scatter in galaxy cluster
  mass-observable relations".

	Due to the ongoing TIARA workshop, the talk is scheduled on
  Friday lunch time. So, please follow the normal lunch talk  
instructions
  (attached below) for your lunch box ordering.

  Regards,
