Dear YJ,

Could you please circulate this?  This is only scheduled today.  Sorry for
the short notice.  Thanks.

NCU Special Colloquium

Robert Jedicke (U. of Hawaii, Pan-STARRS Team)

Title: Pan-STARRS & Solar System Science

Abstract:

The Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS)
at the University of Hawaii's Institute for Astronomy is a funded
project to repeatedly survey the entire visible sky to faint limiting
magnitudes (m_R~24).  It will be composed of four 1.8m diameter
telescopes each outfitted with fast readout orthogonal transfer
Giga-pixel CCD cameras.  A prototype telescope (PS1) is scheduled for
operations early in 2008 with the other telescopes becoming available
a few years later.  More than 65% of the surveying time will be in a
mode suitable for the discovery of new solar system objects.  In a  
single lunation Pan-STARRS will detect about five times more solar  
system objects than the entire currently known sample.  Within its  
first year Pan-STARRS will have detected ~20,000 Kuiper Belt Objects
and by the end of its ten year operational lifetime we expect to have
found 10^7 Main Belt objects and achieve ~90% observational
completeness for all NEOs larger than ~300m diameter.  With these data
in hand Pan-STARRS will revolutionize our knowledge of the contents
and dynamical structure of the solar sytem.
