Dear Yi-Jehng,

I've received a message from Prof. Oyama Koichiro at Space Science
Institute of NCU. It is about the JEM-EUSO mission. Could you please
distribute the information on TAN network?

Thank you,

Dear Friends

The JEM(Japan Experiment Module)-EUSO Mission is ongoing.
The mission is to explore Universe by studying the atmospheric glow which 
will be generated by cosmic particle. By tracking the trace of glow which is 
produced by cosmic particle deep in the atmosphere,we can know the energy 
and direction of the cosmic particles. The feasibility of the principle has 
been alreayd verified.
As main instrument of EUSO project is a photmeter of large diameter, the 
instrument can be used to study airglow as well as sprites,South Atlantic 
Anomaly.

I am asked by Dr Ebisuzaki(Leader of the mission) to inform this project so 
that Scientists from Taiwan can collaborate. I am sure that the 
collaboration will benefit both side.

If you are interested in the Project, please contact Dr Ebisuzaki.
His e mail adress is;

ebisu@postman.riken.go.jp

Sincerely yours

Oyama
Advisor to EUSO
