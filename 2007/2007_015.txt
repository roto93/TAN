 Dear all,

        Despite the annual party on Friday, we will have two colloquia this
 week. Dr. Kinwah Wu from University College London is visiting this week
 after his participation in the TIARA winter school last week. On Wednesday
 (02/07), he will give a talk titled "Emission from accreting black holes
 - general relativistic radiative transfer". Dr. Daisuke Iono will also be
 visiting from NAOJ later this week. On Thursday afternoon (02/08), he
 will present his recent research with a talk titled "High Resolution
 mm/submm Observations of Starbursting Galaxies Near and Far".

        Please notice the special DATES/TIME of these talks. Mark your
 calendar and remember to join the events!

 Regards,

 sheng-yuan

  Speaker : Dr. Kinwah Wu (University College London)
  Title   : Emission from accreting black holes
              - general relativistic radiative transfer
  Time    : 02/07 (Wed) 2:00 PM
  Location: Rm 716

  Speaker : Dr. Daisuke Iono (NAOJ)
  Title   : High Resolution mm/submm Observations of
              Starbursting Galaxies Near and Far
  Time    : 02/08 (Thu) 2:00 PM
  Location: Rm 716
  Abstract: The discovery of FIR/submm bright galaxies has advanced
            our understanding of formation and evolution of galaxies.
            In the local universe, extensive multi-wavelength observations
            toward FIR bright galaxies (i.e. U/LIRGs) have revealed
            that these systems are compact, often dominated by starbursts,
            and morphologically disturbed. In the distant universe, the
            SCUBA bolometer onboard JCMT has successfully detected a
            number of faint and distant submm bright sources, but the
            coarse angular resolution given by the JCMT has made the
            identification of the exact optical/NIR counterpart extremely
            difficult. The radio-FIR correlation allows us to indirectly
            identify the optical/NIR counterparts using radio
            interferometers such as the VLA. However, the radio
            emission is detectable only up to moderately high redshifts
            (z = 2 - 3), and the potentially more distant submm galaxies
            are largely unexplored. For sources with robust radio
            counterparts, existing mm/submm instruments can probe the
            amount of cold molecular gas present in the galaxy, provided
            that follow-up optical spectroscopy yields accurate redshifts.
            For sources without (or with multiple) radio detections, the
            only way to identify the exact optical/NIR counterpart is to
            use sensitive and high resolution submm interferometers.
            The Submillimeter Array (SMA) now allows us carry out this
            task. Armed with the 1 - 2 mJy sensitivity and sub-arcsecond
            astrometry, we can now search for the exact location where
            the bright submm emission comes from. The SMA also allows
            us to study the FIR bright galaxies in the local universe
            with unprecedented resolution and sensitivity in the submm,
            allowing us to make direct comparisons with the properties
            in high-z galaxies.

            In this talk I will present some of our recent results of
            dust continuum observations toward submm galaxies obtained
            at the SMA. I will also present our new CO(3-2) observations
            toward NGC6240, which is a LIRG that is included in our
            ongoing SMA survey of local U/LIRGs. Further, I will present
            preliminary results from our comparison of gas properties
            between local U/LIRGs and high-z galaxies. I will conclude
            this talk with future prospects using the ALMA telescope.
