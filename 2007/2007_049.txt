Subject: CAST 2007 deadline reminder (April 29)


Dear Colleagues,

   This weekend (by April 29) will be your last chance to register and 
to submit your abstracts for the CAST 2007 annual meeting in Tainan.   
Please don't miss it.  The organizing committees are looking forward 
to see you there and wishing you enjoy the atmosphere of the southern 
part of Taiwan.  It's time to prepare your abstract, to visit the CAST 
website, to register first, then, to submit if you haven't done that.  
Your abstract will be published (if you do not disagree) in the Journal 
of Taipei Astronomical Museum later this year.

   As far as I have heard, the CAST website and its internet connection
works well.  Please take a look.  Any question or suggestion can be sent
to cas @ astro.ncu.edu.tw (without the spaces around the "@").  Here are
the URLs of some critical webpages.
