Dear YJ,

Could you please advertize this new workshop in Beijing through TANET?

Thanks,

Sienny

Subject: KIAA-PKU summer school and workshop 2008 on Cosmic Reionization

              KIAA-PKU Summer School and Workshop 2008

     Cosmic Reionization
     - the Formation and Evolution of Stars, Galaxies and Black Holes

                   First Announcement

A summer school and a workshop will be held at the newly established Kavli
Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics at Peking University (KIAA-PKU),
Beijing on July 1 - 11, 2008.

                     I. Programme

The academic activities will consist of:
1) A summer school from Tuesday July 1 to Tuesday July 8
2) A workshop from Wednesday July 9 to Friday July 11
3) Evening lectures delivered by our honorable guests, Profs. Jian-sheng 
Chen,
    Da-run Xiong, Jia-lu Zhang and You-yuan Zhou

The summer school will focus on the various physical and astrophysical
processes, theoretical and numerical tools as well as observational 
techniques
relevant for revealing the cosmic reionization history. It will consist of 14
lectures, each of three hour duration (two hour lecture plus one hour
interactive activities -- exercises, discussions), delivered by national and
international experts of the field. Topics include:

1) An introduction of observational cosmology
    Observations and theoretical framework
2) Theory of structure formation, hierarchical clustering, numerical
    simulations
3) Theory of photoionized gaseous nebulae
4) Radiative transfer and numerical simulations of cosmic reionization
5) The reionization of hydrogen -- observational probes:
    a) CMB and polarization;
    b) High redshift QSOs and galaxies;
    c) Ly alpha emitters;
    d) H I 21cm
    e) IR background
    f) Gravitational lensing
6) Properties of first generation of stars, cosmic abundances,
    extremely metal poor stars
7) Feedback from the first stars and galaxies (UV radiation, metals, kinetic
    energy)
8) Dust grains and molecules at high redshifts
9) IGM evolution at intermediate redshifts (elemental enrichment,
    the UV radiation field, He II reionization)
10) Observational facilities, current and planned, in particular the roles
     Chinese facilities such as LAMOST and FAST can play in the study of 
cosmic
     reionization

Invited lecturers of the Summer School:
Andrew J Bunker, Chris Carilli, Xue-lei Chen, Yao-quan Chu (TBC), Xiao-hui 
Fan,
Zu-hui Fan, Andrea Ferrara, Yi-peng Jing, Xiaowei Liu, Hou-jun Mo, Ren-dong
Nan, Siang Peng Oh, Xiang-ping Wu

The workshop will consist of a series of (invited) short talks, each of 20min
duration plus 10min discussion, and a small number of contributed talks. Each
day, there will be an hour-long session set aside for general discussion.
There will also be a poster session.
