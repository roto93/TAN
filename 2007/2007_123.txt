Dear all,

	Due to a last minute change of visitor's travel schedule, the events  
advertised below will be postponed by a couple weeks. An updated  
announcement will be made later on.
	Sorry about the confusion!

> Speaker : Dr. Loic Albert (CFHT)
> Title   : The Search for Very Cold Brown Dwarfs at the
>              Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope
> Time    : 09/07 (Fri) 2:00 PM
> Location: Rm 716
> Abstract: In a short span of 12 years since the discovery of the first
>           methanic Brown Dwarf, GJ 299B, a variety of classical  
> studies
>           done on main-sequence OBAFGKM stars over the course of the
>           last century have been repeated on the newest spectral  
> types,
>           L and T, albeit at a much faster pace. These studies target
>           the binary frequency, the galactic mass function, modelling
>           the atmosphere, etc. The quest for even colder objects
>           belonging to the elusive Y spectral type is more than ever
>           raging. CFHT, with its two instruments, Megacam in the  
> visible
>           and WIRCam in the NIR, is particularly well suited to  
> hunt for
>           brown dwarfs, where wide-field coverage is the name of the
> game.
>           I will describe a few projects done at CFHT whose objectives
>           are to find cold brown dwarfs in the solar neighborhood and
>           to characterize their binary frequency.  Covering close to
>           1000 sq. degrees, the Canada France Brown Dwarf Survey  
> (CFBDS)
>           is already finding the coldest BDs at spectral types later
>           than T8.5.

                            August 31, 2007  
Dear Colleagues,

    As we venture into the 21st Century, it just so 
happens that the human race is becoming capable 
of making use of their hi-tech's to explore what is 
going on at the edge of our Universe or, equivalently, 
what had happened much early on at the very early 
universe, shortly after the Big Bang. This has stiffened 
the competitions among astronomers and particle 
physicists in their vigorous pursuits for the true theory 
of cosmology, such pursuits being un-imaginable even 
a decade ago.

    Here in the Asia Pacific Region including mainland 
China, Korea, Japan, Taiwan, and Australia, there emerge 
a large number of cosmologists and particle astrophysicists, 
most of them in their young ages. It is important that we 
participate in this round of competing for this kind of new 
knowledge.

    Here in Taiwan and especially at the Research Center for 
Cosmology and Particle Astrophysics (CosPA Center) at 
National Taiwan University (Taida), we wish to actively 
join the crusade of the scientists worldwide in this pursuit of 
the observation-based cosmology, through the so-called 
Taiwan CosPA Project.  The CosPA center intends to organize 
a symposium, the 2007 International Symposium on Cosmology 
and Particle Astrophysics (CosPA2007), from November 13 to 
November 15, 2007 in Taipei, Taiwan.

    The CosPA2007 is the fourth conference of this nature. In the 
past, many new results were reported by researchers in Taiwan. 
The symposium provided a very important forum for exchanging 
ideals and learn new techniques. In the forefronts of the 
observational and theoretical cosmology and particle astrophysics. 
We hope to continue this important activity.  There will be invited 
review lectures, invited talks, and contributed talks. 

    We look forward to seeing you in Taipei.

                                       Sincerely yours,
                                       W-Y. Pauchy Hwang
                                       National Taiwan University
