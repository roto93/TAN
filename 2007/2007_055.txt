Dear Colleagues,

ALMA-Taiwan Project team will hold the 4th ALMA-Taiwan town meeting
at National Cheng Kung University (NCKU) during the CAST2007 meeting.
All the people, who are interested in the Atacama Large
Millimeter/Submillimeter
Array (ALMA) Project, are invited to the meeting.

Date: June 2, 2007
Time: 18:00-20:00 (start right after the CAST2007 meeting)
Venue: Medical College of National Cheng Kung University
           (1F lecture hall where the CAST2007 meeting will be held.)

ALMA is the largest ground based, international astronomical
observational facility ever built, and is a partnership of North America,
Europe, and Japan in cooperation with the Republic of Chile.
It is currently under construction in the Chajnantor area in the Atacama
desert in northern Chile. ALMA will be studying a broad range of exciting
science, such as weather patterns on solar system planets, the formation
of planets and stars in our galaxy, the motions within active galactic
nuclei,
and the formation of the earliest galaxies at z~10. In September 2005,
Taiwan has started a collaboration with ALMA-Japan to participate
in the ALMA Project. At the same time, Taiwan has been exploring
a possibility to collaborate with ALMA-NA, followed by a recent big
progress.
You can find some more information on the project
at http://alma.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw.

At the town meeting, we are going to discuss following topics:

-Latest status of the ALMA-Taiwan project
-Science cases and preparation
-User support

We will provide light foods and drinks during the meeting.
If you are interested in attending the meeting, please register on-line at
http://alma.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/activities/CAST/2007/registration.html
by May 25, 2007. For more details, including any suggestions and
omments on the meeting, please feel free to send emails to
Nagayoshi Ohashi (ohashi@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw).

We look forward to seeing all of you at the meeting!
