Dear all,

	Due to a last minute change of visitor's travel schedule, the events  
advertised below will be postponed by a couple weeks. An updated  
announcement will be made later on.
	Sorry about the confusion!

best,

> Speaker : Dr. Loic Albert (CFHT)
> Title   : The Search for Very Cold Brown Dwarfs at the
>              Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope
> Time    : 09/07 (Fri) 2:00 PM
> Location: Rm 716
> Abstract: In a short span of 12 years since the discovery of the first
>           methanic Brown Dwarf, GJ 299B, a variety of classical  
> studies
>           done on main-sequence OBAFGKM stars over the course of the
>           last century have been repeated on the newest spectral  
> types,
>           L and T, albeit at a much faster pace. These studies target
>           the binary frequency, the galactic mass function, modelling
>           the atmosphere, etc. The quest for even colder objects
>           belonging to the elusive Y spectral type is more than ever
>           raging. CFHT, with its two instruments, Megacam in the  
> visible
>           and WIRCam in the NIR, is particularly well suited to  
> hunt for
>           brown dwarfs, where wide-field coverage is the name of the
> game.
>           I will describe a few projects done at CFHT whose objectives
>           are to find cold brown dwarfs in the solar neighborhood and
>           to characterize their binary frequency.  Covering close to
>           1000 sq. degrees, the Canada France Brown Dwarf Survey  
> (CFBDS)
>           is already finding the coldest BDs at spectral types later
>           than T8.5.
