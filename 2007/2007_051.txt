 Title:  Radio continuum and HI study of
         gas-loss processes in nearby galaxies

 Abstract: 
         One of the prominent contributions towards the cosmic
         evolution of galaxies and inter-galactic medium could
         be from the gas-loss processes going on in galaxies.
         We have studied a number of galaxies in radio continuum
         and HI using both the VLA and the GMRT where different
         components of the interstellar medium are pushed outwards
         due to various gas-loss processes like starburst-driven
         superwinds, AGN-driven nuclear outflows, ram pressure
         stripping and tidal interactions. Severe kinematic effects
         of the superwind on the HI-ISM have been seen in the
         superwind galaxy NGC1482. Expanding shock wave from
         the outflow is possibly creating a starformation ring 
         around it. We have found HI outflow to be associated
         with the molecular, ionised and synchrotron plasma outflow,
         possibly due to an young superwind, in the Seyfert 
         galaxy NGC6764. In the disturbed Virgo cluster galaxy
         NGC4438, the complex HI velocity field of NGC4438 show
         diverging iso-velocity contours suggesting the affects
         of ram pressure from the cluster medium. We have tentatively
         discovered a 140 million solar-mass HI-tail of NGC4438
         extending up to 75kpc from it to coincide with a faint
         stellar tail.  As a rare example we have found evidences
         of ram pressure stripping in the member galaxies of the
         group Ho 124. Trailing velocity field of the one sided
         extra-planer HI-loop, HI-tails and down stream
         HI-accumulations are seen in them. Three galaxies in the
         cluster Abell 1367 are known to have 50-75 kpc long tails
         emitting radio continuum and H_alpha. We did not detect
         any HI in their tails but we find that 20-30% of excess
         HI-gas is accumulated on the down-stream sides of the
         disks, due to the affects of ram pressure from the cluster
         medium. In this talk I will summarise the results of our
         study and discuss the importance of studying such systems
         for better understanding of gas and galaxy evolution.
