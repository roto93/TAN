Dear Prof. Hsiang-Kuang Chang,

Could you please kindly distribute the message to
Suzaku AO-3 proposers to colleagues in your country?

It is not critical for most proposals, but since the
due date is coming soon, it is rather urgent.

Best wishes,

Kazuhisa Mitsuda

=================================
Dear Suzaku Cycle-3 proposers,

As you may have noticed the background files in the following
Suzaku AO-3 cycle proposal pages contained data of about 90 ks
exposures.

XIS: http://www.astro.isas.jaxa.jp/suzaku/proposal/ao3/xis_cxb/
HXD: http://www.astro.isas.ac.jp/suzaku/proposal/ao3/hxd_mat/

We have uploaded background files of longer exposures (about
800ks) for the HXD and we made a link to the night earth
database for the XIS in the above web pages.

For the HXD, the Poisson errors of the background files are
smaller than the systematic errors of the background.  So it
is not necessary to redo your simulations using the new
background in most cases, though the significance of signals
may increase a little bit.
However, we recommend to redo simulations, ONLY if you are
following the simulation recipe in section 5.5.2 of the technical
description AND if you use the absolute values of the chi^2 as
criteria of your observation.

For the XIS,  we recommend to redo simulations if the
exposure time is longer than about 100 ks and your statistics
are determined by background, i.e. the source is faint.
Since as in AO-2, we can provide only the long-exposure
night-earth data, please include the CXB and the galactic
emissions in your simulations as models.

Best regards,

Kazuhisa Mitsuda

Postdoctoral Positions in High Energy Astrophysics and Star and Planet 
Formation
Institute of Astronomy, National Tsing Hua University

The Institute of Astronomy at National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan, 
invites applications for postdoctoral research positions in high-energy 
astrophysics and star and planet formation. The successful candidates 
will work with faculty members of the institute including Hsiang-Kuang 
Chang, Huei-Ru Chen, Dean-Yi Chou, Ing-Guey Jiang, Albert Kong, and 
Shih-Ping Lai. Their research activities involve theoretical 
investigations and observations in various wavebands with facilities 
like Chandra, XMM, Integral, RXTE, Suzaku, Hubble, Spitzer, SMA, etc. 
On-going instrumentation projects include the Nuclear Compton Telescope 
(NCT) in collaboration with UCB/SSL, and an optical observing network 
for exoplanet transit. The postdoctoral scholars will be encouraged to 
develop new initiatives in-line with their own research interests. 
Applicants must have a PhD in relevant research fields. The appointment 
will be for two years initially, and will likely be renewed for 
additional years depending on performance and continued funding.

Applicants should submit a curriculum vitae, a list of publications, and 
a statement of research interests to hkchang@phys.nthu.edu.tw. 
<mailto:hkchang@phys.nthu.edu.tw.> Applicants should also make 
arrangements for three letters of recommendation to be sent directly to 
Prof. Hsiang-Kuang Chang, Institute of Astronomy, National Tsing Hua 
University, Hsinchu 30013, Taiwan. Letters of recommendation can be sent 
via e-mail. Applications received by January 31, 2008 will receive full 
consideration, but the positions will remain open until filled.

Hubble Space Telescope Cycle 17 Call for Proposals

Release Date: December 03, 2007

Proposal Deadline: March 07, 2008

NASA and The Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) are pleased to announce 
the Cycle 17 Call for Proposals for Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Observations 
and funding for Archival Research and Theoretical Research programs. 
Participation in this program is open to all categories of organizations, both 
domestic and foreign, including educational institutions, profit and nonprofit 
organizations, NASA Centers, and other Government agencies.

This solicitation for proposals will be open through March 07, 2008, 8:00pm 
EST. The Astronomer's Proposal Tools (APT), which is required for Phase I 
Proposal Submission will be made available/released for Cycle 17 Phase I use 
during the 2nd week of January 2008. Results of the selection will be announced 
in early June 2008.

All programmatic and technical information, as well as specific guidelines for 
proposal preparation, are available electronically from the STScI World-Wide 
Web site at the Announcement Web Page with URL: 
http://www.stsci.edu/hst/proposing/docs/cycle17announce

In Cycle 17, proposers should assume that HST will operate in three-gyro mode. 
HST has been operating in two-gyro mode since 29 August 2005.

For further details, see http://www.stsci.edu/hst/proposing/docs/cp17-newopps

Questions can be addressed to the STScI Help Desk (email: help@stsci.edu;

Dear all,

	We will have a special colloquium talk this Friday (12/07).
  Prof. Paul Ricker is visiting these two weeks from University of
  Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Prof. Ricker's research interests
  include the evolution of galaxies and clusters of galaxies,
  globular clusters, the interstellar medium, and supernova explosions.
  He will present a talk titled "Sources of scatter in galaxy cluster
  mass-observable relations".

	Due to the ongoing TIARA workshop, the talk is scheduled on
  Friday lunch time. So, please follow the normal lunch talk  
instructions
  (attached below) for your lunch box ordering.

  Regards,

  sheng-yuan
