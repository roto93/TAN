Dear all,

 	Tomorrow (Friday), we will have a colloquium presented by Dr.
  Simon Campbell. Coming from Australia, Simon joined IAA only a few
  months ago back in April. His main expertise focuses on low metallicity
  stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis. Tomorrow, he will present his work
  with a talk titled "Structural Evolution & Chemical Pollution from
  the First and Second Stars".

 	My apology for this late notice. Please mark your calendar and
  remember to join the event!

  best,
