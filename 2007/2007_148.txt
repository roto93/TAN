Hi YJ, a submission for TAN...

The 2007 Across-Strait conference on Telescope and Advanced Observing 
Technique has been postponed for one week due to the delay in the entry 
bureaucracy of the Chinese participants.  It now will be held Sep 6 
(Tuesday) to 8.  You can get the latest program from the NCU frontpage, 
http://www.astro.ncu.edu.tw.  If you plan to come, please take a moment to 
register at the same link, so we get a head count.

See you next week at Central.

Wen Ping
