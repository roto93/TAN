Dear All:

   Dr. Loic Albert, the CFHT wircam supporting astronomer will visit us on 
Nov 12 ~ Nov 19. He will give us a seminar talk "The Search for Very Cold 
Brown Dwarfs at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope" and also give a 2~3 hrs 
lecture about infrared observations "Observing in the NIR with WIRCam".

  The seminar will be at 2PM on Friday Nov 16 in our conference room 716. 
The lecture will be at 2PM on Tuesday Nov 13 also in the conference room.

   Please see the attached file for the abstracts of the talks.

   It will be a excellent time for you if you want to know how to 
propose/use wircam and reduce the data. Please talk to him during his stay 
in IAA.

Cheers
Shiang-Yu

The Search for Very Cold Brown Dwarfs at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope


In a short span of 12 years since the discovery of the first methanic Brown
Dwarf, GJ 299B, a variety of classical studies done on main-sequence OBAFGKM
stars over the course of the last century have been repeated on the newest
spectral types, L and T, albeit at a much faster pace. These studies target the
binary frequency, the galactic mass function, modelling the atmosphere, etc.
The quest for even colder objects belonging to the elusive Y spectral type is
more than ever raging. CFHT, with its two instruments, Megacam in the visible
and WIRCam in the NIR, is particularly well suited to hunt for brown dwarfs,
where wide-field coverage is the name of the game. I will describe a few
projects done at CFHT whose objectives are to find cold brown dwarfs in the
solar neighborhood and to characterize their binary frequency.  Covering close
to 1000 sq. degrees, the Canada France Brown Dwarf Survey (CFBDS) is already
finding the coldest BDs at spectral types later than T8.5.


Observing in the NIR with WIRCam 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary

What does it mean to do near-infrared imaging with WIRCam? What are the
difficulties and the steps involved in processing data and why? My goal is to
provide a good basic understanding to students who may have never processed NIR
images or have limited experience with it. As much as possible, I want to give
examples with actual WIRCam images. My lectures will mostly be a Keynote
presentation with examples using ds9. I will try to cover as much of the
following material as is possible in one morning (about 2 hours).

Introduction

	-What are th main science objectives of observing in the NIR?
		-Photo-z
		-Brown dwarfs
		-Galactic center astrometry
		-Redshift of z=7 galaxy hunt
		-Dust cloud mass estimation
		-Starburst age typing

	-Instrumentation - detector
		-Reading out images

	-Instrumentation - hardware
		-Need for a Lyot mask hance reimaging optics
		-Optics is cold, glasses are different
		-Moving mechanism very difficult to operate because of differential contraction
		-Liquid nitrogen and cryocoolers

Detrending Steps with WIRCam data
	-Dark subtraction
	-Flat fielding
	-How to build a flat field? Dome vs twilight flats.
	-Bad pixel masking
	-Sky subtraction
	-Source masking during sky construction
	-Stacking data

The NIR Skies.
	-Graphs of atmospheric absorption 1-2.5 microns.
	-OH- Emission lines.
	-Thermal emission.
	-Definition of filter bands - the Mauna Kea system.
	-Sky brightness variations - Vaduvescu paper.
	-Sky brightness variations - in J,H,K from WIRCam data.

Sky Subtraction Examples with WIRCam Data.
	-Why the need for sky subtraction?
		-Comparison between detrended images of WIRCam and Megacam
		-Correction of 2nd-order flat fielding problems
	-Example with DP21 using time-adjacent exposures vs DP21 using time-distant exposures.
	-Example with optimized DP21 vs optimized DP7.
	-Example of the Wide Dither Pattern (WDP).
	-Example of Nodding Dither Pattern (NDP).

Advantages of NIR technology
	-Fast readout
	-Non-destructive readout enables on-chip guiding.

	-Crosstalk as seen with WIRCam
		-"Edge" and "Negative" crosstalks
		-"Positive" crosstalk
	-Persistence
		-Example of LowOH1 processed images
		-Example of long darks
		-Behavior as seen on intensity vs. time graphs
