Dear Colleagues,

as a principal investigator (PI).

The deadline for proposal submission for the ASIAA SMA time
for the next semester is September 7 (Friday), 2007, 4AM in the

in advance.

When submitting your proposal, please make sure to select
"ASIAA" as your destination TAC in the submission web page.
Please submit your proposal early.  If you encounter any technical
problem with the submission facility, please contact TATSUHIKO
