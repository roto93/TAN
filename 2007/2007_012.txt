Dear Prof. Kuan,

Would you please announce the following on TAN, thanks very much for your
help.

------------------------
Lulin One-meter Telescope (LOT) X Call for Observing Proposals for 2007A
Proposal Deadline X February 6th, 2007

The Lulin One-meter Telescope (LOT) solicits observing proposals for the
semester of 2007A.  The new semester begins on March 1st, and ends on August
31st.

Those who are interested in applying for observing time can download the
proposal form from the NCU/IA web page:

http://www.lulin.ncu.edu.tw/lot/lot_apply.doc

and submit the proposal to the following email address:

tac_lulin@astro.ncu.edu.tw

with a copy to the TAC chair to avoid occasional erroneous delivery:

        sun@astro.ncu.edu.tw

by midnight, February 6th, 2007, Taiwan time (UT+8).  The allocation of
observing time will be announced before February 10th, 2007.  In addition to
the research proposals, we will also consider educational projects for
advanced astronomical observation courses.

Instruments Available:

There are two instruments available for the 2007A semester, the Lulin CCD
Imager (LCI) and the Lulin Compact Spectrograph (LCS).  The LCI is the major
observing instrument using the PI 1300 CCD.  The technical information of
LCI can be found in the following web page:

http://www.lulin.ncu.edu.tw/lot/1300b.pdf

The second instrument, the LCS, has been tested and calibrated during the
2006B semester.  The calibration of this instrument has been improving but
has not achieved its expected performance.  Thus observers using this
instrument are on a shared risk basis.  Users are encouraged to keep in
close contact with the technical team to receive the updated information.
Below please find the specifications of LCS:

Lulin Compact Spectrograph (LCS)

Dispersion element: 2 gratings (300 lines/mm and 1200 lines/mm)
Detector: Apogee AP-8(SITE chip, 1K 1K)
Length of slit (projection onto the sky with LOT optics): 8.5 arcmin
Width of slit (projection onto the sky with LOT optics): 1.5 arcsec (fixed)
Resolving power: 333 @ 500nm (300 lines/mm) and 1333 @ 500nm (1200 lines/mm)
Wavelength coverage: 380-760nm, and 500-900nm (300 lines/mm)
Calibration lamp: Fe-Ar-Ne
