Dear Postdocs and students,

 The CFHT-Taiwan PI's would like to charge the CFHT-Taiwan
User's Committee to nominate a postdoc or student as an
observer to the CFHT-Taiwan TAC process, one observer per
semester. The primary aim of this exercise is for the observer to 
1) understand the TAC process, and 2) explain this process 
(from the user's viewpoint) to the community at large. In order 
to pick up a person who has the ability to do both, for those 
who are interested in this, please send the following information 
to the CFHT-Taiwan User's Committee 
(cfht_uc@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw):

a) Last name / First name
b) Position (please mention how many years you have been in the
position, e.g., 3rd year PhD student)
c) Affiliation
d) Have you been a PI of a CFHT proposal? (yes or no)
e) Have you been a Co-I of a CFHT proposal? (yes or no)
f) Are you going to submit a CFHT proposal for semester 2008A?

The deadline is Sep 14. If you have any question, please send an
email to cfht_uc@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw.


Thank you very much!

Cheers,

Bau-Ching Hsieh

Chair of the CFHT-Taiwan User's Committee
