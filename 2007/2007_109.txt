has access to the SMA, SMT, KP12M and CFHT, through the ASIAA TAC.  The
appointees should have a demonstrated record in research and a commitment
to excellence in undergraduate and graduate teaching.  Preference will be
given to individuals whose interests, abilities, and experience benefit
our existing programs.  Candidates should have a Ph.D. in Astronomy,
Astrophysics, Planetary Sciences, Physics or a closely related field, and
preferably have post-doctoral experience.

Applicants should submit a cover letter, a current CV, a publication
list, a description of how your future research and teaching will
contribute to the overall goals of the School, a (photo)copy of doctorate
diploma, and arrange three letters of reference sent to Dr. Yi-Jehng Kuan
