> Subject: [Colloquium] ASIAA Special Colloquium Next Thursday (05/10)


 Dear all,

        Next Thursday, we will have a special colloquium talk given by
 Dr. Alwyn Wootten, the ALMA North American project scientist from
 National Radio Astronomical Observatory (NRAO) in Charlottesville, VA.
 The talk will be titled ""Beyond ALMA's First Fringes"

        As you may know, ALMA reached a major milestone by achieving its
 first fringes at the ALMA Test Facility at Socorro with prototype antennas
 in early March, and the project continues moving forward quickly. In this
 talk, Dr. Wootten will give some project progress overview, with an
 emphasis on science. He will also introduce some coming up difficult
 decisions facing the Science group, such as the final adoption of the
 configuration on the site, imaging simulations, and what they might mean
 to future science with ALMA.

        The talk will be held at Dr. Poe Lecture Hall at Institute
 of Atomic and Molecular Sciences (IAMS) on the NTU campus at 2:00PM
 next Thursday (May 10) afternoon.

        Please notice the SPECIAL TIME and LOCATION of this talk. Mark
 your calendar and remember to join this special event!

 Regards,

 sheng-yuan
