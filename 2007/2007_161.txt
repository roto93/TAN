  Dear all,

	This week, we have two colloquium visitors:

	As you may have learned from Shigehisa, Dr. Masako Yamada
  from NAOJ is visiting between 11/19 and 11/26. She has been studying
  galactic and extragalactic ISM physics as well as active galaxies.
  Currently she is working on three dimensional molecular line transfer
  calculation along with hydrodynamic simulations for these systems.
  On Tuesday (11/20), she will give a colloquium talk titled "Three
  Dimensional Radiative Transfer Study of Molecular Gas - towards ALMA
  Era".

	Dr. Patrick Cote from Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics,
  Canada will be visiting Taiwan this week, first at NCU, and then to
  IAA on Friday. Dr. Cote's research interests lie primarily in the
  areas of stellar populations, stellar and galactic dynamics, dark
  matter, and galaxy formation. He will give a colloquium on Friday
  about his recent research with a title "New Results on the Structure
  of Early-Type Galaxies: Two Dichotomies Disappear".

	The abstracts of these talks can be found at our colloquium
  web page - "https://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/act/colloquium.php".
  Please notice the special schedule of these events. Mark your
  calendar and remember to join!

  Regards,

  sheng-yuan
