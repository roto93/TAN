  Dear all,

 	This Friday (09/21), Prof. James Nester will be visiting IAA
  from Central University. Prof. Nester has been long working in the
  field of gravitation and relativity. On Friday afternoon, he will
  introduce his recent research with a talk titled "Torsion Cosmology
  and the Oscillating Universe".

    	Please mark your calendar and remember to join the talk!

  best,

  sheng-yuan

  Speaker : Prof. James Nester (National Central University)
  Title   : Torsion Cosmology and the Oscillating Universe
  Time    : 09/21 (Fri) 2:00 PM
  Location: Rm 716
  Abstract:  Investigations of the dynamic modes of the Poincare gauge
             theory of gravity found only two good propagating torsion
             modes; they are effectively a scalar and a pseudoscalar.
             Cosmology affords a natural situation where one might see
             observational effects of these modes. The scalar torsion
             mode has certain distinctive qualities; here we consider
             only this mode. Via numerical evolution of the coupled
             nonlinear equations we show that the scalar torsion mode
             can contribute an oscillating aspect to the expansion rate
             of the Universe. From the examination of specific cases
             of the parameters and initial conditions we show that for
             suitable ranges of the parameters the dynamic scalar torsion
             model can display features similar to those of the presently
             observed accelerating universe.
