Subject: 2007 Taipei School/Workshop on Large Scale Structures of the Universe

2007 Taipei School/Workshop on Large Scale Structures of the Universe

Date: 2007/05/28 – 2007/06/02
Place: Room F104, Science Building, Science Campus of NTNU

Introduction: The origin and evolution of the large scale structures remains 
one of the most important topics in modern cosmology. Though the discovery 
of dark energy led us venturing into an uncharted territory, large piles of 
precise observational data and efficient numerical techniques have helped 
the study on the Universe continue to thrive in the 21st century. The 
purpose of this School/Workshop is to introduce students and faculties in 
Taiwan the progress and the state of the art in this fascinating frontier of 
physics and astronomy.

(1) Prof. Li-Zhi Fang, Dept. of Physics, University of Arizona
(2) Prof. Houjun Mo, Dept. of Astronomy, Univ. of Massachusetts at Amherst 
(3) Prof. Yipeng Jing, Shanghai Astronomical Observatory
(4) Prof. Long-Long Feng, Purple Mountain Observatory
