Call for SMA proposals for 2007B

Dear Colleagues,

Proposals are solicited for the ASIAA time of the Submillimeter Array
(SMA) for the period from November 1st, 2007, to April 30th, 2008.
Those who are affiliated to a Taiwanese university or a Taiwanese
research institute are eligible to apply for the ASIAA SMA time
as a principal investigator (PI).

The deadline for proposal submission for the ASIAA SMA time
for the next semester is September 7 (Friday), 2007, 4AM in the
morning (Taiwan time).  [The deadline corresponds to September 6
(Thursday), 2007, 10AM HST in Hawaii, USA.]

All Taiwanese SMA proposals must be submitted through the SMA
submission facility (https://sma1.sma.hawaii.edu/propose.html).
The SMA proposal submission facility has been upgraded.
New proposers in particular need to get registered (through the
submission web site) before submitting a proposal.  All potential
proposers are encouraged to visit the submission facility well
in advance.

When submitting your proposal, please make sure to select
"ASIAA" as your destination TAC in the submission web page.
Please submit your proposal early.  If you encounter any technical
problem with the submission facility, please contact TATSUHIKO
HASEGAWA (hasegawa@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw).

For technical information on the SMA, please visit
    http://sma1.sma.hawaii.edu/proposing.html .
For Taiwan and ASIAA specific aspects (including the ASIAA
proposal selection process and the amount of available
observing time), please visit
    http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/~SMART/ .

The SMA is a complex instrument.  Consultation or collaboration
with those who are familiar with the SMA is highly recommended.
Contact points for consultations are also found in the ASIAA
web page listed above.

Additional messages from the ASIAA SMA TAC :

Subcompact configuration, in addition to the usual Compact, Extented,
and Very-Extended configurations, will be available.  High spectral
resolution (25kHz) will be available.  In addition, 400 GHz
receivers will be available on four or more antennas.  If you would
like to use the 400 GHz receivers, please state so (and justify)
in the proposal.

The PI of a successful proposal will be encouraged to provide an
observer at the summit of Mauna Kea.  For more detail, please
consult the ASIAA web page listed above.

In order to encourage PhD students to use the SMA, the ASIAA SMA TAC
will make some considerations to proposals for PhD thesis projects.
Please visit the ASIAA web site for details.

In order to make efficient use of SMA data, the ASIAA SMA TAC will expect
Co-Is to follow up the analysis and publication of already executed or
allocated projects under a PI who becomes unable to do the work for
various reasons.  Potential co-investigators should be aware of their
possible responsibilities or obligations.  PIs should make best efforts
to obtain a consent before putting someone's name on a proposal as a
Co-I.

Sincerely,

Tatsuhiko Hasegawa
ASIAA SMA TAC Chair
