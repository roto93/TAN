Hi Yi-Jehng,

Please circulate the following colloquium for Oct 28 at Tamkang University.

        Thanks.

----------------------- TKU Physics Colloquium ------------------------
 Speaker  : Prof. Ingrid Mann
            School of Science and Engineering, Kindai University, Osaka, Japan
 Title    : Dust in Planetary Systems: the Sun and beta Pictoris
 Time     : 10/28 (Tuesday) 2:10 pm
 Location : TKU Tamsui Campus, Science Building, Room S215
 Abstract :
   Vega-like systems or dust debris disks are characterized by a small
   amount of circumstellar gas, the presence of planetary objects and dust.
   The small solar system objects (trans-Neptunian objects, asteroids,
   comets, and meteoroids) and the interplanetary dust cloud also form a
   planetary debris disk, although the solar system dust density is much
   lower than for the debris disks that are observed around other stars. A
   large amount of observational data, though of different kind, exist for
   the solar system and the √ÉPictoris system. After discussing our basic
   knowledge of planetary disk evolution, this presentation will address
   the existence of a second-generation gas component and the existence of
   amorphous and crystalline silicates in the solar system and around beta
   Pictoris.
