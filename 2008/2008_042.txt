Hi there,

Please join us for our regular colloquium in IANCU. This week we'll have Prof.
Tung Roh-Suan from Shanghai Normal University talking about dynamical black
hole. We will have some refreshment after the talk. Anyone who is interested
on the topic with our speaker can also join our refreshment section.

Title:
Energy and angular momentum in dynamical black holes and other strong
gravitating systems

Abstract: Traditional description of black holes in terms of event horizons is
inadequate for many physical applications, especially in the case of
non-stationary spacetimes. Quasi-local notions of trapping horizons enable one
to significantly extend the laws of black hole mechanics to the dynamical
regime with the associated notions of energy and angular momentum. These
notions are recently generalized to untrapped regions with the `stationary
untrapped boundary conditions' so that we can study the change of energy and
angular momentum for general strong gravitating systems, e.g., before the
black hole horizon was formed. I shall review these different notions of
conserved quantities in General Relativity.
