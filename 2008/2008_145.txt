Hi Yi-Jehng,

Please circulate the following colloquium for Oct 3.  Thanks.

Detecting the Atmospheres of Extrasolar Planets

Prof. Laird Thompson, Astronomy Department
University of Illinois

Spectroscopy of transiting extrasolar planets has the potential of revealing 
the detailed nature of many planetary atmospheres.  Good spectral energy 
distributions are already available for two hot Jupiters (HD 209458b and HD 
189733b) from Spitzer, and higher dispersion spectra at optical wavelengths 
have been successfully obtained only for HD 209458b. After many attempts to 
obtain additional high dispersion spectra of these and other transiting 
extrasolar planets (on STIS/HST, HET, Keck, Subaru), it is widely recognized 
that differential transit spectroscopy of extrasolar planets presents major 
challenges.  In my talk I will discuss transiting extrasolar planets, the 
challenges of spectroscopy, and the design of a new fiber fed high spectral 
purity spectrograph for CFHT capable of detecting the atmospheres of many 
extrasolar planets.

> Announcing the third in a series of workshops on the chemistry of
> Titan's atmosphere, co-organized in recent years by Ralf Kaiser, Alex
> Mebel, Ian Sims and Arthur Suits. The meeting will include a mix of
> observation, experiment, theory and modeling, and will include both
> neutral and ion chemistry. We are planning the workshop to begin with
> registration and a reception in the evening on Wednesday February 25,
> with Gordon conference style sessions beginning the next morning and
> continuing through mid-day on Saturday the 28th.

> Saturn's moon Titan possesses a dense atmosphere and is widely
> considered as a natural laboratory on the planetary scale to  
> understand
> the prebiotic chemistry of proto-Earth. The Cassini-Huygens mission to
> Titan has opened a new chapter in Solar System exploration and
> extraterrestrial atmospheric chemistry. On January 14, 2005, the  
> Huygens
> probe successfully descended through the atmosphere of Titan and  
> safely
> landed on its surface. An extraordinary new world has been unveiled.  
> The
> scientific data obtained by the Huygens experiments and by the Cassini
> Orbiter - currently being archived and analyzed - are far from being
> understood.
>
> This workshop is part of the NSF-Collaborative Research in Chemistry
> (CRC) Network "Chemistry of Unsaturated Hydrocarbons in Titan's
> Atmosphere" and the third in a series of annual meetings aimed to  
> better
> understand the hydrocarbon chemistry taking place in the atmosphere  
> and
> on the surface of Titan. It brings together atmospheric modelers,
> astronomical observers, mission specialists, planetary scientists,
> physical chemists (dynamics, kinetics, photochemistry), theoreticians
> (electronic structure, dynamics calculations), astrobiologists, and
> organic chemists. By focusing on the interplay between observational &
> mission data, modeling, and fundamental investigations of the  
> underlying
> chemical reactions and photochemical processes, we also seek emerging
> generalized concepts on the chemical processing of hydrocarbon-rich
> atmospheres of planets and their moons in the Solar System. By  
> exploring
> the current boundaries of planetary science and chemical knowledge, we
> can more effectively design new laboratory experiments under
> well-defined conditions (and recommend promising directions for  
> further
> observational searches) and upcoming Solar System missions to resolve
> hitherto unanswered aspects of molecular synthesis in our Solar  
> System.
>
> The workshop will feature invited (35 min + 10 min discussion) as well
> as contributed talks (20 min + 5 min discussion) as well as several
> keynote lectures, and is limited to 60 participants. Visits are  
> planned
> to the Arecibo radio observatory as well as El Yunque National  
> Rainforest.
