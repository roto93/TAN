Title:
  Dust in Planetary Systems: the Sun and  Pictoris

Abstract:

Vega-like systems or dust debris disks are characterized by a small amount
of circumstellar gas, the presence of planetary objects and dust. The
small solar system objects (trans-Neptunian objects, asteroids, comets,
and meteoroids) and the interplanetary dust cloud also form a planetary
debris disk, although the solar system dust density is much lower than for
the debris disks that are observed around other stars. A large amount of
observational data, though of different kind, exist for the solar system
and the Pictoris system. After discussing our basic knowledge of planetary
disk evolution, this presentation will address the existence of a
second-generation gas component and the existence of amorphous and
crystalline silicates in the solar system and around Pictoris.
