             ======================================

              -- 2nd circular (6th August 2008) --

 Dept. of Astronomical Science, Graduate Univ. for Advanced Studies
                              and
 Subaru Telescope, Optical-IR Division, & Astronomy Data Center, NAOJ

                      December 1-5, 2008
     National Astronomical Observatory, Mitaka, Tokyo, Japan

[Purposes]

It is our great honor that Subaru Telescope located at the summit of
Mauna Kea in Hawaii (http://subarutelescope.org/index.html) has been
in steady operation for 10 years and continuously producing cutting-
edge results in modern observational astronomy of various areas.

We are pleased to announce that Subaru Telescope at National
Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ) is going to host a winter
school that provides graduate students and young astronomers with
an opportunity to learn data analyses and the scientific results
obtained with Subaru.
The school will be held at NAOJ Mitaka and it will offer a series of
lectures, experience with Subaru data, and a half-day trip to the space
agency ISAS/JAXA at Sagamihara, Kanagawa (http://www.isas.ac.jp/e/).
All the lectures will be given in English.

This school is co-sponsored by the Graduate University for Advanced
Studies (GUAS; http://www.soken.ac.jp/en/academics/astronomical.html)
where NAOJ is one of the member organizations to host graduate students.
GUAS has been sponsoring Asian Winter Schools for various branches
of science since 2004, and this year, GUAS and Subaru/NAOJ will
jointly host this winter school specifically on optical and
near-infrared astronomy with Subaru.

The goals of this winter school inviting students from outside Japan
is to encourage the use of Subaru Telescope by wider astronomical
community and to promote international collaborations in Asia.
Exchange of young students will also form the basis of our
partnership in the future astronomy in Asia.

[Application]

Supposed participants are mainly graduate students from universities
and institutes in Asian countries. We hope not to discourage
young post-docs or graduate students working at other areas to
participate as well, but priorities would be given to graduate students
from Asian countries.  Participants are expected to have some knowledge
of and experience with UNIX.

The number of participants will be limited to ~20 from abroad and
~20 from Japan at most, and the selection will be made by the
organizers based on the submitted applications if the applications
exceed the above limitations.  Limited travel support will be available.

All the participants are supposed to be at school for the entire period
(ie., 13:00 1st Dec -- 12:00 5th Dec), and a partial participation
will not be formally allowed and will be lowerly prioritized in
selection.

All the applicants should visit our webpage
(application page - http://optik2.mtk.nao.ac.jp/winter08/apply/),
fill the application form, and submit it through the web by no later
than 5.00pm, 15th September in JST.
In the case of an application by a graduate student, his/her supervisor
is requested to send separately a reference in support of the
application *directly* to us either by post or by e-mail
(winter08-reference at optik.mtk.nao.ac.jp)
which should arrive at NAOJ by 5.00pm, 15th September (JST).

[Cost and Financial Support]

Registration Fee (excursion, buffet, snacks, and tea/coffee) of
5,000 Yen (in cash only) will be collected from each participant
on his/her arrival at the reception desk.

Free accommodation will be provided upon request throughout the school
period (ie, from the night of 30 Nov to the morning of 6th Dec).
Some daily allowances will also be paid which would be sufficient
for ordinary meals.
In addition, upon request, we will cover the minimum fares of domestic
travel within Japan and also provide a partial support for international
travel depending on our available budget and the actual number of
participants.

[Programme]

Dec 1 (Mon) start at 13:00, opening remarks, guidance,
           lectures (telescope, instruments), reception party
Dec 2 (Tue) lectures (data archives/analysis), data analysis
Dec 3 (Wed) science lectures, excursion to ISAS/JAXA (afternoon)
Dec 4 (Thu) data analysis, banquet (buffet style)
Dec 5 (Fri) data analysis, school photo, closing remarks, finish at 12:00

*In the data analysis sessions, each participant chooses one of the
 following Subaru instruments: Suprime-Cam, FOCAS, HDS, or IRCS.
 A preferred instrument should be specified in the application form.
 See http://www.naoj.org/Observing/Instruments/index.html for details
 of each instrument.

Lectures and brief description of the data analysis courses:

 Telescope/Instruments: M. Iye

 Science: N. Kashikawa (extragalactic)
          M. Tamura (exoplanets, star formation) (TBD)

 Data archive: R. Furusho, (Y. Yamada, J. Nishizawa, T. Nishimura)

 Data anaslyses:

   *Suprime-Cam (Optical Wide-Field Imager): M. Yagi, Y. Komiyama
   Optical imaging data from the mosaic CCD camera will be reduced to
   construct a contiguous image using a dedicated software for Suprime-Cam.
   Then flux/astrometric calibration will be made.

   *FOCAS (Faint Object Camera And Spectrograph): T. Hattori, T. Morokuma
   Data reduction of optical long-slit low/mid resolution spectra
   using IRAF, including CCD calibration, extraction of spectra and
   wavelength/flux calibrations.

   *HDS (Optical High Dispersion Spectrograph): W. Aoki, S. Kawanomoto
   Data reduction of high resolution, multi-order echelle spectra
   using IRAF, including CCD calibration, extraction of spectra and
   wavelength calibration.

   *IRCS (Infrared Camera and Spectrograph):
   Y. Minowa (imaging), M. Imanishi (spectroscopy)
   For imaging course, a standard data reduction procedure of infrared
   images taken with IRCS will be shown, using IRAF. For spectroscopy
   course, data reduction of an infrared low-resolution single-order
   spectrum will be made, using IRAF.
