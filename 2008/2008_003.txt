Dear Yi-Jehng,

I've received a message from Prof. Oyama Koichiro at Space Science
Institute of NCU. It is about the JEM-EUSO mission. Could you please
distribute the information on TAN network?

Thank you,

Daisuke

Dear Friends

The JEM(Japan Experiment Module)-EUSO Mission is ongoing.
The mission is to explore Universe by studying the atmospheric glow which 
will be generated by cosmic particle. By tracking the trace of glow which is 
produced by cosmic particle deep in the atmosphere,we can know the energy 
and direction of the cosmic particles. The feasibility of the principle has 
been alreayd verified.
As main instrument of EUSO project is a photmeter of large diameter, the 
instrument can be used to study airglow as well as sprites,South Atlantic 
Anomaly.

I am asked by Dr Ebisuzaki(Leader of the mission) to inform this project so 
that Scientists from Taiwan can collaborate. I am sure that the 
collaboration will benefit both side.

If you are interested in the Project, please contact Dr Ebisuzaki.
His e mail adress is;

ebisu@postman.riken.go.jp

Sincerely yours

Oyama
Advisor to EUSO

Dear colleagues,

This is to remind you to sign up for the the 10th Asian-Pacific Regional 
IAU Meeting (APRIM) will be held August 3-6, 2008 in Kunming, Yunnan of 
China.  Registration is now open and scientific programs being formulated. 
Information can be found with this url,

  http://aprim.ynao.ac.cn/

Yunan as you know is a very pleasant place to visit, and the APRIM will 
certainly bring lots of opportunities to meet with old friends and make
acquaintances of new ones.

I encourage you all to browse through the web and consider to join.

Happy 2008!
