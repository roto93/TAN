Dear YJ, 

Could you please post this announcement for the upcoming TIARA winter 
school on the TANET? 

Here are the links for the general announcement and program for the 
upcoming TIARA winter school on Star Formation, on Feb 5-10, 2009. 
Graduate students and undergraduate seniors are strongly encouraged to 
attend. Please do remember to register! Due to limited resources, we 
can only provide 50 students with lodging and meals. In case the 50 slots 
are filled, please still register and contact us for a wait list. All 
interested working astronomers are welcome, schedules especially made for 
those will be commuting to NTHU for day trips.
