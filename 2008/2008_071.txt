                   Second Asian Radio Astronomy School
                    Aug 18-22, 2008 at ASIAA, Taipei

        (https://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/act/radio_school/2008/)

                          Second Announcement


Dear colleagues,

	This is the second announcement for the Second Asian Radio Astronomy
School to be held on August 18-22, 2008 at Academia Sinica, Institute
of Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA) in Taipei, Taiwan.

Program :
	A tentative school program is available online at the school website.
This school is intended for students and scientists with strong  
interests
in carrying out research with radio interferometric facilities. Starting
with an evening reception on Aug 17th (Sunday), the program includes  
lectures
on the fundamental concepts of radio astronomy and interferometry, as  
well
as a number of selected facilities such as Japanese and Asian VLBI,  
VSOP-2,
SMA, and ALMA. Significant emphasis will be given to the interferometric
data reduction and imaging processes and hands-on exercises with the SMA
and Japanese VLBI observational data. Information about the confirmed  
lecturers
and instructors will be updated on the website.

Registration :
	The online registration has been open since April 15th, 2008. Due
to the lecture hall and lodging capacity, the number of attendant is
limited to 100 people. Should there be too many applicants, priority  
will
be given to applicants from Taiwan, Japan, and the East Asian region.

Lodging and Support:
	ASIAA will provide shared accommodation on the Academia Sinica campus
for participants (except those from Taipei city/county) during the  
school
period from Aug 17th to Aug 22th. Maps are available on the school web  
site.

	Lunches and a banquet will also be arranged during the school period.
Overseas participants are, however, expected to meet their own travel  
and
other expenses.

	Related information can be found on the school web page at
https://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/act/radio_school/2008/.
Iquiries regarding the school can be made to the following e-mail
address, radio_school@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw.

Dear All,

The talks on this Friday are as following. Anyone who is interested on talking 
with speakers can join our refreshment section (after 15.00) or lunch (say,
12.00 wait outside the elevators, 10 F).

*******************  Astronomy Colloquium  ************************
***************  Institute of Astronomy, NCU  ***********************

Title:
Asteroids, Comets and Meteoroids
 
Speaker:
Prof. Shinsuke Abe 阿部新助
IANCU
 
Date:
05,09,2008

Time:
14:00-15:00

Place:
S4-1013

Abstract:
It is of great importance to know evolution of solar system small bodies.
Asteroids that have survived since the early solar system (4.6 Gyr ago) have
experienced numerous collisions that influenced thermal histories and orbital
properties. Thus, the physical nature (size, shape, density, composition and
orbital distribution) of asteroids is fundamental to understanding how our
solar system has been evolved. Some asteroids are in fact either dead or
dormant cometary nuclei. Though an Earth impact of 1 km-size asteroid is
likely within a million years, frequent meteor fireballs or meteorite falls on
Earth are indications of collision (ejection) events. Asteroidal particles
have been proposed as a source of some meteor showers. However, their parent
bodies and dynamical evolution of meteoroids are still subject to debate. In
my talk, I'd like to present topics about Potentially Hazardous Asteroid
Itokawa explored by Japanese spacecraft HAYABUSA, asteroidal Earth-grazing
fireball, cometary/asteroidal meteor spectroscopy and meteoroid's Lunar impact
flush. The Panoramic Survey Telescope And Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS)
project will give us quantitative understanding of the connection among small
bodies and their association with meteoroids that generates new insights of
our solar system.
