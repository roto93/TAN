Dear all, 

Dr. Fumi Yoshida and Prof. Takashi Ito will visit Institute of Astronomy, NCU 
this week. During their stay, they are kind to promise to give us talks about 
their research at our group meeting (small body club). Basically, these talks 
will be started on 16:00, May 27 at room s4-901-1 (Science Building IV, 9th 
floor, Planetary Science Lab). Each talk will be about 30 minutes. We are 
pleased to welcome anyone who interests in their topics to join. 

The titles of their topics are: 

"Asymmetric impacts of near-Earth asteroids on the Moon"
by Prof. Takashi Ito
Assistant Professor, National Astronomical Observatory of Japan 

"An insight into the solar system history through the size distribution of 
Jupiter's Trojans" 
by Dr. Fumi Yoshida 
Postdoc, National Astronomical Observatory of Japan 

Thanks, 

Hsiang-Fu Huang
