Dear Yi-Jehng,

Would you please post this information at TAN?

Thanks,

First Announcement on
"Millimeter and Submillimeter Astronomy at High Angular Resolution"

June 8-12, 2009
Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan

Sponsored by

Academia Sinica ¡V Institute of Astronomy & Astrophysics
National Science Council
National Astronomical Observatory of Japan
National Radio Astronomical Observatory
Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics

Co-hosted by
The Astronomical Society of the Republic of China

1. Motivation

In recent years, the Submillimeter Array (SMA), the Plateau de Bure Interferometer (PdBI), and the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy (CARMA), Nobeyama Millimeter Array (NMA) have been producing exciting scientific results at arc-second or even sub arc-second resolution. At the same time, large single-dish telescopes, including Nobeyama 45 m, IRAM 30 m, CSO 10m, JCMT 15 m, NANTEN 4 m, ASTE 10m, APEX 12m, SPT 10m, GBT 100m, LMT 50m (near completion), CCAT 25m (under development), continue to push the frontier both in sensitivity and wavelength. In 2011, early science using ALMA may start, and in 2012, full operation is planned to start.

It is, therefore, most timely for us to hold a conference in 2009 to review the latest findings, obtained through millimeter and submillimeter observations at high angular resolution, and to outline the road map guiding us towards the ALMA era. 

The topics to be addressed at the conference are:

The solar system
Galactic low-mass and high-mass star formation
Outflows/Jets
Protoplanetary disks/Debris disks
Evolved stars
Nearby galaxies
Galactic center
AGNs and ultra luminous galaxies
High-Z galaxies
Astrochemistry
Instrumentation

2. Conference Organization

The conference will consist of 5 full-day sessions covering the above-mentioned topics. We expect to accommodate a total number of 250 participants. We plan to have about 40 invited talks (~30 minutes each). In addition, short oral contributions (~20 minutes each) and poster presentations will be arranged. Since the time for talks is limited, poster presentations will play an important role at this conference. There will be no formal conference proceedings. However, we plan to make all the presentations, including posters, available at our conference website.

4. Registration

There will be a registration fee (150 USD/person for early registration and 200 USD/person for regular registration), which covers the abstract book, lunch boxes, coffee/snacks for breaks, and the conference banquet. The deadlines for the early and regular registrations are February 28, 2009 and April 30, 2009, respectively. Registration will start on December 15, 2008 via our conference website (http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/taipei09).

5. Abstract Submission

All the participants are encouraged to present their latest scientific results at the conference. Abstracts of the presentations will be submitted through our conference website. Although we will try to accommodate as many talks as possible, a limited number of presentations will be selected for short oral contributions. The deadline for the abstract submission is March 31, 2009

6. Location and Accommodation

The conference will be held in the newest conference hall on the main campus of the Academia Sinica (http://www.sinica.edu.tw), located on the eastern side of Taipei City, while your accommodation can be arranged in the downtown area so that it would be easy for you to explore Taipei City during your free time. We will provide free shuttle buses (scheduled) between the hotels and the conference venue. For students and young scientists, low-cost accommodation on the campus of the Academia Sinica can be also arranged. More details on the accommodation will be provided in our conference website.
