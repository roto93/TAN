Redshift-space distortions due to the peculiar velocities and the Alcock-
Paczynski effect are known to cause the anisotropy of the clustering 
statistics. To extract the information correctly from the redshift surveys, 
it is important to quantify the anisotropic nature in addition to the 
conventional angular averaged statistics. The multipole moments of the 
spatial power spectrum can be used to quantify the anisotropic nature of the 
clustering. In this talk, we report the application of our estimaotor for 
the quadrupole power spectrum to the SDSS Luminous Red Galaxy sample. The 
measured quadrupole power spectrum is constantly positive at large scale
(small k) due to the liner redshift-space distortions. At smaller scale, the 
sign changes to negative which can be explained by the Fingers-of-God effect 
due to the non-linear effects. We find that the measured spectrum is 
consistent with the model with the bias parameter b~2 and pairwise peculiar 
velocity dispersion sigma_p~400km/s, which shows that galaxies from this 
sample are more clustered than the background dark matter.
