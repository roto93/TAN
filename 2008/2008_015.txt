Dear all,

Next Monday (1/28) there is an ASIAA/LeCosPA joint colloquium talk by 
Prof. Alan Watson of School of Physics and Astronomy, University of 
Leeds, UK. Alan Watson FRS has been Professor of Physics in Leeds since 
1984. His research interests are in high energy cosmic rays. He has been 
involved in field station experiments in Yorkshire and at the South 
Pole. Currently, he leads an international team in collaboration with 
the Nobel Prize Winner, Professor James Cronin (of the University of 
Chicago and an Honorary Leeds Graduate), which is constructing, in 
Argentina, the largest cosmic ray experiment ever built. When completed 
it will cover an area the size of Lancashire and will detect the highest 
energy particles in Nature, which are almost certainly of extragalactic 
origin. Professor Watson was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society in 
2000 and is currently a PPARC Senior Research Fellow. Below is the 
detail of his talk:

Title :
Recent Results by Pierre Auger Observatory
Abstract:
In 1938, Pierre Auger and colleagues in Paris discovered that showers of 
cosmic rays can extend over wide areas when they recorded simultaneous 
events in
detectors placed about 30 m apart. Nearly 70 years later, on the pampas 
of western Argentina, a cosmic-ray observatory bearing Auger's name is 
studying
extensive air showers over a much wider area, many times the size of 
Paris itself. These showers are generated by particles with far higher 
energies than any man-made accelerator can reach, and they continue to 
challenge our understanding.

In the talk I will briefly describe the motivation for the construction 
of the Pierre Auger Observatory and discuss the latest results on the 
energy spectrum and on the arrival direction distribution at the highest 
energies. some implications for particle physics beyond the LHC will be 
mentioned.

> 	ALMA-Taiwan Project team will hold the 5th ALMA-Taiwan town  
> meeting at National Chao-Tung University (NCTU, Hsinchu), during  
> the Annual Meeting of the Physical Socity of Republic of China  
> (PSROC). People who are interested in the Atacama Large Millimeter/ 
> Submillimeter Array (ALMA) Project are cordially invited to the  
> meeting.
>
> 	Date: January 28, 2008
>
> 	Time: 19:00-21:00
>
> 	Venue: International Conference Hall, B1, Engineering Building IV,  
> NCTU (工程四館 B1 國際會議廳)
>
> 	ALMA is the largest ground based, international astronomical  
> observational facility ever built, and is a partnership of North  
> America, Europe, and Japan in cooperation with the Republic of  
> Chile. It is currently under construction in the Chajnantor area in  
> the Atacama desert in northern Chile. ALMA will be studying a broad  
> range of exciting science, such as weather patterns on solar system  
> planets, the formation of planets and stars in our galaxy, the  
> motions within active galactic nuclei, and the formation of the  
> earliest galaxies at z~10. In September 2005, Taiwan has started a  
> collaboration with ALMA-Japan to participate in the ALMA Project.  
> Taiwan will soon collaborate with ALMA-North America as well on the  
> project. You can find some more information on the project at  
> "http://alma.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw".
>
> 	Below is the preliminary agenda of the meeting:
>
> 	1) Latest status of the ALMA-Taiwan project
> 	   * Chile Construction
> 	   * Taiwan Front-End Integration Center
> 	   * Engineering Development
> 	   * Software Status
> 	   * ALAM Regional Center
> 	   * Science Preparation
> 	2) Open Discussion
> 	We will provide food and drinks prior the meeting. If you are
