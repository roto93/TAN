Dear Yi-Jehng, 

I have been asked to serve on the SOC of the Third East Asia Numerical Astrophysical Meeting to 
replace Chi Yuan.  It was suggested to me that one way to inform astronomers in Taiwan about 
the meeting is through TANnet.   Would you send it out  the information that the meeting takes 
place in Nanjing, China on Nov. 10-13, 2008.  Further information can be obtained from the website 
http://cosmology.pmo.ac.cn/eanam2008 

Thanks. 

Best Regards, 

Ron
