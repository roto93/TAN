                     First Announcement on
           The 4th Japan-Taiwan ALMA Science Meeting

                       5-6 April 2008,
                  Ibaraki University, Japan

            http://stars.sci.ibaraki.ac.jp/~almajt4/

This is the first announcement of the 4th Japan-Taiwan ALMA Science
Meeting to be held at the Mito campus of the Ibaraki University
on 5-6 April 2008.

Further information is available on our web page:
http://stars.sci.ibaraki.ac.jp/~almajt4/

WORKSHOP FORMAT

Astronomers in Japan and Taiwan are putting their efforts together
to the ALMA project. In order to promote the discussion on the
science and collaboration between Japan and Taiwan, Japan-Taiwan
ALMA Science Meetings are held roughly once per year since the end
of 2005.

The 4th Japan-Taiwan ALMA Science Meeting will be held on 5-6 April
2008 at the Ibaraki University, Japan. The program will covers status
reports of the project, recent activities in Japan and Taiwan, and
progress reports from sub-working groups as well as scientific talks.
Although the SOC is planning this meeting as a general science meeting
covering all the major topics of ALMA sciences, we strongly encourage
you to discuss in your talk the possible proposals or directions to
key sciences with ALMA based on your recent progress.
New scientific topics and fresh idea on the collaboration that were
not discussed at previous meetings are also welcome.
Sub-working group meetings will also be held before the main workshop.
Details will be announced later by each chair of sub-working group.

This meeting will be the first Japan-Taiwan ALMA Science Meeting
hosted by an university in Japan. We encourage graduate students to
join the meeting and give oral or poster presentations.
There is no registration fee.

VENUE

The venue of the meeting will be the Mito campus of the Ibaraki
University. Mito is located about 100 km north east of Tokyo, and
you need to spend about 2.5 hours from the Narita International
Airport. The workshop will be held at a conference hall whose
capacity is about 110 person.

Further information about the venue and travel to Mito can be found
in our web page.

ACCOMMODATION

The LOC has secured 20 single rooms of Hotel STENO in Mito from April
4-7, mainly for participants from overseas. The room rates are about
6,500 Yen per night (including breakfast) for a single room. If you
would like to ask the LOC to book your room, please fill in the
check-in and check-out date in the registration form, and send it to

your room is reserved or not just after the deadline. The transportation
between the hotel and the University will also be arranged. A list of

ARRANGEMENT OF SUB-WORKING GROUP MEETING

The organization of sub-working group meetings before the main workshop
