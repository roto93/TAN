Hi there,

Please join us for our regular colloquium in IANCU. This week we'll have Prof.
Tung Roh-Suan from Shanghai Normal University talking about dynamical black
hole. We will have some refreshment after the talk. Anyone who is interested
on the topic with our speaker can also join our refreshment section.

Title:
Energy and angular momentum in dynamical black holes and other strong
gravitating systems

Abstract: Traditional description of black holes in terms of event horizons is
inadequate for many physical applications, especially in the case of
non-stationary spacetimes. Quasi-local notions of trapping horizons enable one
to significantly extend the laws of black hole mechanics to the dynamical
regime with the associated notions of energy and angular momentum. These
notions are recently generalized to untrapped regions with the `stationary
untrapped boundary conditions' so that we can study the change of energy and
angular momentum for general strong gravitating systems, e.g., before the
black hole horizon was formed. I shall review these different notions of
conserved quantities in General Relativity.

Dear Pauchy,

   The 2008 China-Japan Korea HNP meeting will be held at Lanzhou IMP
from June 23-27.
   Our friends in Taiwan are welcome to join us.
   If Convenient please put this information in AAPPS Bulletin.

   Best regards,

   Fan Wang

----------------------------------------

The third China-Japan-Korea Hadron and Nuclear Physics 2008 Symposium will be
held from June 23 to 27, 2008 at Institute of Modern Physics (IMP), CAS, in
Lanzhou. This symposium will follow the style of the last two held in Nara,
Japan and Pusan, Korea respectively to provide a forum for physicists of these
countries to discuss the new development on nuclear and hadron physics, aimed
to enhance the collaborations among China, Japan and Korea nuclear physics
community.

The following topics will be focused in this workshop:
(1). Nuclei structure and hypernulcei
(2). Superheavy nuclei
(3). Heavy ion physics
(4). Symmetries in hadronic and nuclear physics
(5). Hadron structure and hadron interactions, exotic hadrons
(6). Hadronic and nuclear astrophysics
(7). Hadronic and quark matter
(8). New facilities and experimental techniques for nuclear and hadronic physics

Please fill out the registration form in the next page and return it to
zhpm@impcas.ac.cn, the dealine for registration is May 10, 2008.

Looking forward to welcoming you in Lanzhou.
