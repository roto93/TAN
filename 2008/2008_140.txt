Title: Results from The First Two-Year Data of the TAOS Project

Abstract:

The Taiwanese-American Occultation Survey (TAOS) aims to search for stellar 
occultation by small (> 1 km) Kuiper-belt objects (KBOs) by collecting huge 
amount of stellar photometric measurements (~10^9) with 3 telescopes.  The 
photometric data produced by a custom aperture photometry are analysed by a 
statistical method which is efficient to detect brief occultation events in 
multi-telescope data.  No statistically significant events were found in the 
first two years of data.  However, the null detection allows us to set a 
stringent upper bound to the size distribution of KBOs.  In this talk, the 
aperture photometry and event detection algorithm will be shown and a detection 
efficiency test and a estimation of the upper bound will be described.
