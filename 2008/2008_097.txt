Astronomy Colloquium 
Institute of Astronomy, NCU

Title:
A Panoramic View of the Milky Way

Speaker:
李昫岱 Dr. Lee, Hsu-Tai
ASIAA

Date:
06,20,2008
(month,day,year) 

Time:
14:00-15:00

Place:
S4-1013

In order to study star formation in the Milky Way ,I used 2MASS colors to
select CTTS and HAeBe star candidates (about twenty thousand in total) that
exhibit infrared excesses. Most of the young stars are tightly confined to the
Galactic plane, except those nearby. This pre-main-sequence (PMS) star sample
is not only in the Orion Arm, but also extends to two nearby spiral arms, the
Sagittarius and Perseus Arms. In addition, I identified about 200 young star
clusters and groups. According to the ages of CTTSs, this PMS star sample
represents star formation history around a few million years ago in the
Galaxy. This unbiased search can help to find loose stellar groups and
distributed young stars that are hard to be recognized from field stars. It is
suitable to study star formation in OB associations which cover large field of
view. I will present star formation in nearby OB associations, some new
identified star groups and clusters, and star formation along the Milky Way
and at high galactic latitudes.

Title:
Survivability of a star cluster in a dispersing molecular cloud

Speaker:
陳慧真 Hui-Chen Chen
NCU

Date:

Time:
15:00-16:00

Place:
S4-1013

Star clusters are believed to from in molecular clouds. By estimating the
ratio of optical clusters to 
embedded cluster, people argued that most of them could not survive for a long
time. Dispersion of 
the parent molecular clouds by stellar winds, UV radiation and/or supernova
explosions might be the 
main mechanism in this short timescale. In this work we study the effect of
the dispersion of 
molecular clouds by N-body simulations. A large set of runs are carried out to
investigate the 
parameter space. The ending time of simulations are set as 30 Myr in every
case since the lifetime of 
molecular clouds is usually from 10 to 30 Myr. In our results, the
survivability of a star cluster is 
related to the mass ratio of the cluster to the entire system ( the cluster
and the cloud) in a certain 
region ( radius). Different dispersion rates are compared to different radii.
An embedded cluster 
seems not easy to disrupt if the parent cloud is less massive or more
extensive. By the robust result 
in our study, the survivability could be predict if the initial conditions of
the cluster and the cloud are 
known.
