> - correction of tropospheric and ionospheric phase errors, including
>   anisoplanatic effects;
> - imaging with heterogeneous arrays and combination of
>   single-dish and interferometric data;
> - deconvolution methods for single fields and mosaics;
> - polarization imaging over wide fields.

> We will include a session for work in small groups, to allow =20
