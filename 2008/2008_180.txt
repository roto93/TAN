      		First Announcement on
    "Japan-Taiwan Subaru-HSC Science/Survey Mini Workshop"
                       22 December, 2008
                            Room 716
    Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Taiwan

Dear Colleagues,

ASIAA will host a one-day mini science workshop on the planned large
sky survey with the "Hyper Suprime-Cam" (HSC), which is a next
generation wide-field (1.5deg FoV) prime-focus camera for the Japanese
8.2m Subaru Telescope at the summit of Mauna Kea, Hawaii. Development of
the camera started in 2007 and is planned to be completed in 2012.
ASIAA is an international partner of the Subaru HSC project. All Taiwanese
astronomers are welcome to bring your ideas for the survey and join the survey.
This mini workshop is a pre-meeting for the coming HSC Science/Survey Workshop
jointly held at NAOJ by Japan and Princeton on January 17-20.

This WS will provide an overview and status of the instrument and survey
designs/strategies (wide, deep, ultra-deep) proposed by astronomers in
Japan/Taiwan for different science drivers. The goal of this WS is to put together
ideas of the survey and integrate the different scientific interests into the survey.
Following the presentation sessions, a discussion session will be held to discuss
possible scientific contributions from the Taiwan side, in particular in software
(e.g., analysis pipelines) development. It will also provide the chance to form subgroups
of the survey by both Taiwanese and Japanese astronomers.

A preliminary list of invited speakers is attached below. Everyone is
welcome to attend the WS - please register from our WS website below.
It is also encouraged to talk about the new ideas for the survey. A few slots will be given
for the contributed talks on the new ideas. Please contact Keiichi Umetsu (keiichi@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw)
for this by ** December 7 **.
