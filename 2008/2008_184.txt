Hi Yi-Jehng

I was reminded of the omission of Adv. of Space Research in my last report 
on the SCI search. To my surprise, in the same period, namely 1999 to 
2008, there are 54 papers with the address associated with "Taiwan".  But 
these papers contain a variety of subjects, from astrophysics, planetary 
science, to aerospace or atmospheric science, so would be time-consuming 
to sip through.  I am sure the same would apply to JGR or similar 
journals.  I also left out PASP (because I did not know a quick way to do 
it other than keying exactly the whole journal name), but I suspect it 
does not affect the overall number much.

I was also advised by one colleague that the surge of publication in 2007, 
at least at IAA, has something to do with redirection of emphasis.  This 
is a good clarification.

It is appreciated if you could circulate the above to the community.

Regards,

Wen Ping
