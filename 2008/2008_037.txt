                 3rd Biennial Leopoldina Conference on

                            "DARK ENERGY"

                        October 7 - 11, 2008
            Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich, Germany

       website: http://www.mpe.mpg.de/events/dark-energy-2008/

A conference of the German Academy of Sciences 'Leopoldina' and the DFG
Transregional Research Center TR33 'The Dark Universe', with support from
the Munich Excellence Cluster 'Origin and Structure of the Universe'

***************************************************************************

Dear Colleagues,

during the last decade a consistent quantitative picture of the universe
has emerged from a wide range of observations, including the microwave
background, distant supernovae and the large-scale distribution of
galaxies. In this standard model of the universe, normal baryonic matter
contributes only 4% to the overall density, 96% are dark components in the
form of dark matter (26%) and dark energy (70%). Particularly, the
existence and amount of dark energy is completely unexpected and raises
fundamental questions about the foundations of modern physics. Is dark
energy merely a cosmological constant, is it a new kind of particle field
that evolves dynamically with the expansion of the universe, or is a new
law of gravity needed? Observers are intensely analysing current surveys
or design new ones that will illucidate the properties of Dark Energy. At
the same time, theoreticians are producing new ideas about its nature and
possible origin. The conference aims to bring together observers, modelers
and theoreticians from particle physics and astrophysics to present and
discuss latest results and explore possible routes for future research.

The conference website:

http://www.mpe.mpg.de/events/dark-energy-2008/

has just been opened for registration and abstract submission. There you
can also find further information on the program, speakers, conference
venue, travel information etc. We are looking forward to welcome you in
Munich this fall.

For the SOC and LOC,

Ralf Bender, Christof Wetterich and Stefanie Phleps

CONFERENCE VENUE AND HOTEL RESERVATIONS
---------------------------------------
The Conference will take place in the historical main building of the
Ludwig-Maximilians-University,Geschwister-Scholl-Platz 1, in the centre
of Munich.

We have made block reservations of hotel rooms for the period October 7
(arrival) - 12 (departure). The hotels are conveniently located for fast
commute with subway or other public transportation. As soon as you are
accepted for the conference, we will send you further information and
contact addresses, and you can choose the hotel you like and book it,
quoting reference "Leopoldina". October is a highly popular time to visit
Munich, so you are advised to book early.

CONTACTS

*** Proposals for CFHT open for semester 2008B ***

  The 3.6 meter optical/infrared Canadian-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) is
now open for proposals from all Taiwan-based researchers for semester 2008B.
The deadline for proposal submission is:

       21 March 2008 - 8:00 am Taiwan time

We anticipate that a minimum of 5 nights, and possibly up to 10 nights, will
be available in semester 2008B, depending on demand and quality of 
proposals.  
Please note that the instruments available for 2008B are MegaCam, WIRCam, 
ESPaDOnS, GriF, and PUEO.  Detailed information on the
telescope, available instrumentation, proposal format, and how to submit
proposals is available from the CFHT web page:
http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/ObsInfo/ObservingProposals/

Exploratory Programs
--------------------
  To encourage innovative science, this semester we will continue considering
"exploratory" programs using MegaCam, WIRCam, or ESPaDOnS that require no 
more
than 1 hour of observing time.  Such proposals will not be refereed, but will
be scrutinized by the TAC and allocated time based on scientific merit and
feasibility.  When submitting such proposals, please state at the beginning 
of
the scientific justification that "This is an EXPLORATORY proposal".

Queued Service Observations
---------------------------
  In addition, we would like to bring to your attention the Queued Service
Observation (QSO) snapshot program.  These are programs that can be executed
with either MegaCam or WIRCam in relatively poor seeing conditions when the
seeing is >1.2".  Projects executed under the QSO snapshot program are not
charged to the available observing time for Taiwan.  Proposals to the QSO
snapshot program will not be refereed, but will be scrutinized by the TAC for
scientific value and feasibility.  More information on this program can be
found at:
http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/Instruments/Queue/qso_2007b_MP.html

Resubmission due to Lost Time
-----------------------------
  If your scheduled project from previous semesters was not completed for any
reason (including bad weather), you will need to resubmit your proposal
explaining why you need more time.  Your proposal will be stronger if the
available data has been analyzed, and you use this data to demonstrate that
the stated science goals can be achieved with allocation of the full
requested time.

Time Allocation Process
-----------------------
  All new proposals, and where deemed necessary resubmitted proposals, are
refereed by researchers selected by the Taiwan-CFHT TAC based on their
demonstrated expertise in the relevant research fields.  Apart from the
referees comments, who are asked to evaluate primarily the scientific
strength of the proposal, the Taiwan-CFHT TAC also takes into account
technical feasibility.  For those who have previously been scheduled
observing time on the CFHT, the Taiwan-CFHT TAC will also take into account
the status of previously executed projects and publications, which should
therefore be adequately described in the relevant section of the proposal.

Contact Persons
---------------
If you have any questions or problems regarding the preparation of the
proposals, please contact Paul Hsieh (bchsieh@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw), 
Shiang-Yu Wang (sywang@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw), or Jeremy Lim
(jlim@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw)
