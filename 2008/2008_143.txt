Detecting the Atmospheres of Extrasolar Planets

Prof. Laird Thompson, Astronomy Department
University of Illinois

Spectroscopy of transiting extrasolar planets has the potential of revealing 
the detailed nature of many planetary atmospheres.  Good spectral energy 
distributions are already available for two hot Jupiters (HD 209458b and HD 
189733b) from Spitzer, and higher dispersion spectra at optical wavelengths 
have been successfully obtained only for HD 209458b. After many attempts to 
obtain additional high dispersion spectra of these and other transiting 
extrasolar planets (on STIS/HST, HET, Keck, Subaru), it is widely recognized 
that differential transit spectroscopy of extrasolar planets presents major 
challenges.  In my talk I will discuss transiting extrasolar planets, the 
challenges of spectroscopy, and the design of a new fiber fed high spectral 
purity spectrograph for CFHT capable of detecting the atmospheres of many 
extrasolar planets.
