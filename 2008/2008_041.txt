Hi there, 

Please join us for our regular colloquium in IANCU. This week we'll have Alf
Tang talking about his PhD research on LISA in Imperial College, London. We
will have some refreshment after the talk. Anyone who is interested on the
topic with our speaker can also join our refreshment section.

Title:
Detecting Cosmic Gravitational-wave Backgrounds with LISA

Abstract:
The current technique to detect gravitational waves is using interferometer to
measure induced length differences along two directions. The frontier
space-borne interferometer is Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), which
is an NASA/EAS joint project. LISA consists of three spacecraft 5 million km
away from each other. During orbiting the Sun, three spacecraft transmit laser
pulses back and forth to construct two huge independent Michelson
interferometers in the space. LISA aims to measure the variation of
arm-lengths to one part of 10^23 to detect weak signals of gravitational
waves. It plans to launch in late 2017 time frame. LISA targets on four kinds
of sources: compact binaries, super-massive black holes in the centre of
galaxies, extreme mass ratio binaries, and cosmic gravitational-wave
backgrounds (CGBs) produced in the very early universe. The detectable
candidates of CGBs by LISA are vacuum-bubbles colliding during cosmological
phase transition, and catastrophic burst events produced by cosmic strings.?
In order to recover CGBs in a spectrum, we need to determine how many types of
CGBs exist in the spectrum in the first place. Along with the study on
fundamental physics, we can obtain models to formalise CGBs. Model selection
method in Bayesian statistics is applied to determine which scenario among all
models at hand is the best description of data. As long as the model has been
suggested, the parameters involved in the model are then estimated through
Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, which can reduce consuming time from
exponential cost to linear scale as the number of parameters increases. In
addition, simulated annealing and Gelman & Rubin methods are adapted to speed
up the searching and test the convergence of the chains, respectively. ?The
entire study intends to discover some unseen aspects of fundamental physics.

Next Friday, Prof. Tung Roh-Suan will talk on something about dynamical black
hole.

Reminder: Closing date for SMA proposal submission for 2008A

Dear Colleagues,

This is a reminder that the closing date and time for SMA proposals
is March 14 (Friday), 2008, 4AM (Taiwan time) in the morning for the
2008A semester.  [The closing date corresponds to March 13 (Thursday),
10AM Hawaii time.]  Those who are affiliated to a Taiwanese university
or a Taiwanese research institute are eligible to apply for the ASIAA
SMA time as a principal investigator (PI).

All Taiwanese SMA proposals must be submitted through the SMA
submission facility (http://sma1.sma.hawaii.edu/proposing.html,
then click "SMA Project Account").
New proposers in particular need to get registered (through the
submission web site) before submitting a proposal.  All potential
proposers are encouraged to visit the submission facility well
in advance.

When submitting your proposal, please make sure to select
"ASIAA" as your destination TAC in the submission web page.
Please submit your proposal early.  If you encounter any technical
problem with the submission facility, please contact TATSUHIKO
HASEGAWA (hasegawa@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw).

For technical information on the SMA, please visit
    http://sma1.sma.hawaii.edu/proposing.html .
For Taiwan and ASIAA specific aspects (including the ASIAA
proposal selection process and the amount of available
observing time), please visit
    http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/~SMART/ .

The SMA is a complex instrument.  Consultation or collaboration
with those who are familiar with the SMA is highly recommended.
Contact points for consultations are also found in the ASIAA
web page listed above.


Sincerely,

Tatsuhiko Hasegawa
ASIAA SMA TAC Chair

> Subject: [Colloquium] ASIAA Colloquium talk this week

Dear All,

This week's colloquium speaker is Dr Yuji Urata of Saitama University, 
who we are not unfamiliar with. Dr Urata is leading the EAFON (East-Asia 
GRB Follow-up Observation Network) and the WIDe-field telescope for GRB 
Early Time (WIDGET) and on Friday (3/14) he will tell us

"Crisis of the GRB standard fire ball model".

Please mark your calendar and remember to join the event!
