Dear All,

We are going to have two talks (One about brown dwarfs and another about plasma) this Fri.  Anyone 
who is interested on talking with speakers can join our refreshment section (after 15.00) or lunch 
(say, 12.00 wait outside the elevators, 10 F).

Speaker: Dr. Chung-Sang Ng
The million-degree solar corona: How can it get so hot?		
S4-1013
The solar corona is basically the atmosphere of the sun, only that it is made out of plasma 
(hightemperature ionized gas). One of the greatest mysteries in solar physics is how the solar corona 
can be heated up to millions of degrees (Kelvins) while the photosphere (surface of the sun) is only 
about six thousands degrees. Since the photosphere is much denser than the corona, its fluid motion 
carries enough free energy to account for the heating rate. The problem becomes how to convert the 
free energy of the photosphere to heat the corona. Over the years, there have been many coronal 
heating theories. Many of them make use of the observed magnetic field as a medium for such 
energy conversion. In this talk, I will give a brief introduction of this problem, and describe some 
results from our theoretical investigation of this problem.

Polarization probes the dusty atmosphere of brown dwarfs			
S4-1013
Brown dwarfs enhabits the realm intermediate to less massive stars and giant planets. Depending on 
their spectra, they are divided into two classes, the relatively hotter brown dwarfs belong to L dwarfs 
and the brown dwarfs with clear signature of methane belong to T dwarfs. Due to incomplete 
gravitational settling, the atmosphere of L dwarfs contains condensates of various species with grain 
size ranging from sub-micron to a few tens of micron. In the present talk, I'll discuss how scattering 
of radiation by dust particles gives rise to linear polarization in the optical and the observed 
polarization data constrains the physical properties of dust as well as the oblateness of the 
photosphere of L dwarfs.
