This is the first official announcement of Optical/NIR Data Reduction Mini-Workshop. OIR telescopes 
and cameras are getting bigger, so that the sizes of the image are also getting larger. The ability of 
handling/processing these data plays the most important role in the timescale of scientific production. 
Since year 2003, the astronomers in Taiwan have CFHT access, and Subaru telescope can be accessed 
from year 2007 as well. A lot of high quality data have been taken, but processing these data is an 
issue. This mini-workshop aims at enhancing the audiences' ability for reducing/processing modern 
wide field OIR data. For those people who don't have their own OIR data in hand, a lot of free archive 
data are sitting there, and this mini-workshop will help you to know how to deal with these data. We 
also would like to encourage graduate students and seniors contemplating grad studies in astronomy - 
even those who have not done Optical/IR observations before - to attend this workshop.

This is a one-day mini-workshop, and the date is Wednesday, July 2, 2008. The place of the workshop 
will be held in Room 716 in Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Academia Sinica (ASIAA). If Room 
716 is too small to handle participants, we might change to a larger room to be announced at a later 
date. For people from outside Taipei city/county, we will provide the accommodation support (Howard 
International House) on 7/1 night.

The registration, agenda and other details are in the following website:

The deadline of registration is Friday, June 6, 2008. If you have any question, please send email to 
bchsieh@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw

We are looking forward to see you in the workshop.  

Thank you very much.
