> Subject: [Colloquium] ASIAA Colloquium talk this week

Dear All,

We have two colloquium talks this week. Dr. Hiroyuki Hirashita of 
University of Tsukuba is visiting IAA from 2/22 to 2/29. His main 
interest is in galaxy formation and evolution, particularly in 
theoretical modeling of dust enrichment in galaxies, theoretical studies 
on extinction and emission of dust in primeval galaxies, and star 
formation properties of nearby metal-poor dwarf galaxies, and also test 
of theory by using AKARI data and prediction for future observation such 
as ALMA and SPICA. On Tuesday (2/26) he will tell us about

"Dust as a Key Species for Galaxy Evolution".

And on Friday (2/29) Dr. Sujan Sengupta of Indian Institute of 
Astrophysics will discuss a new method :

"Polarization - A Potential Tool to Probe Brown Dwarfs and Exoplanets".

Dr Sengupta has been a visiting scholar of TIARA since April 2007. His 
major field of research is on extra-solar planets and brown drawfs and 
his new method for searching for extra-solar planets was widely reported 
in Indian newspapers and also New Scientist magazine. Please mark your 
calendar and remember to join the events!

Best Regards,

Lung-Yih
