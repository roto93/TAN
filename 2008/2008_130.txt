ARO: Call for Proposals (Fall 2008)
------------------------------------

Dear all,

ASIAA's ARO proposal deadline for Fall 2008 (October 01 - January 31)
is set on September 16, 2008 (Tuesday).

The Arizona Radio Observatory operates the Sub-Millimeter Telescope (SMT)
and the Kitt Peak 12 Meter.  The SMT currently supports a dual-polarization,
ALMA Band-6 1 mm receiver, a dual-polarization 0.8 mm receiver, and a new
ALMA Band-9 (602-720 GHz) dual-polarization receiver.   The 12 m supports
2 mm and 3 mm (65-176 GHz) dual-polarization receivers.  A new ALMA Band-3
receiver will be available at the 12 m for the 85-116 GHz band (3 mm HI),
also dual-polarization. Remote observing is available at both ARO telescopes.

Please refer to http://aro.as.arizona.edu/ for more information on
observations and for the latest system status of the telescopes.
People are required to use the KP12M and SMT proposal cover/summary
sheets for their proposals:
(under "Proposal Submission Information" at
  http://aro.as.arizona.edu/proposal_submission_information.htm
for the SMT -
  http://aro.as.arizona.edu/proposals/smt_prop_sub.htm
and for the 12m -
  http://aro.as.arizona.edu/proposals/12m_prop_sub.htm )

Proposals should consist of the standard proposal cover sheet and
a scientific and technical justification. The justification may be
up to two pages of text, and should not exceed three pages including
tables, figures and references.  For electronic submission, ASIAA
only accepts proposals in either PS or PDF format.

Please submit your proposals by 24:00 midnight September 16, 2008 to
kuan@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw ; no late proposals will be accepted.


Kind regards,
Yi-Jehng Kuan
