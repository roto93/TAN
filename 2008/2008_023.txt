FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT

Protostellar Jets in Context
7-11 July 2008, island of Rhodes, Greece.

Protostellar Jets in Context is an international astrophysics conference 
organized  at the initiative of the JETSET  European Research and 
Training Network (RTN) (www.jetsets.org).  It will take place from July 
7-11, 2008 inclusive on the island of Rhodes, Greece. The main goal is to 
review the recent contributions of theoretical and computational 
modelling, high-resolution observations, and laboratory experiments to our 
understanding of jets and outflows from young stars. The connection with 
accretion disks and the similarities with outflow phenomena in other 
astrophysical contexts will also be explored. Members of the European RTN 
Molecular Universe and Constellation are also welcome to participate with 
their coordinators serving as members of the Scientific Organising 
Committee.

Topics to be discussed include:

The jet/wind-launching region: Theories, observations, and numerical 
simula-tions that address the origin of atomic and molecular jets and 
winds in young stars, the physics of the star/disk interaction zone, the 
connectiion with accre-tion disks and the role of jets in removing angular 
momentum.
The propagation, cooling, stability, and environmental impact of jets on 
scales from the stellar envelope to the parent cloud. Large-scale 
numerical simula-tions of collimated outflows including AMR  codes and 
cluster/grid technolo-gies. Observations and models of bipolar outflows, 
from the X-ray to the submm regime. The origin of knots in jets.  
Laboratory experiments that  reproduce, in a scaled manner, key aspects 
of the dynamics of astrophysical jets relevant to their formation, 
collimation and interaction with the interstellar medium.  Experimental 
benchmarks for HD and MHD codes and radiative transfer in jets.
Similarities and differences between protostellar jets and their 
astrophysical siblings, for example coronal jets, outflows in planetary 
nebulae, pulsar jets, jets from symbiotic stars and compact binaries, as 
well as the collimated large-scale relativistic outflows associated with 
AGNs and GRBs.
The conference aims to bring together scientists working in these various 
fields to stimulate cross-disciplinary exchange. It will contain both 
invited and contributed talks, as well as poster sessions. Proceedings 
will be published.

Conference Venue and Accomodation:
The conference will take place in the grounds of the international 
convention center of the Rodos Palace http://www.rodos-palace.gr/, a 
5-star resort hotel set in a singular location in one of the most alluring 
destinations of the Mediterranean.  A special room rate has been 
negotiated for participants at 130 (single)/160 (double)  Euros/night. 
Advance booking is available through the conference website. High speed 
on-line Internet connection will be available to hotel guests.
Climate: In Rhodes, the Mediterranean summer heat is offset by a cooling, 
and sometimes strong, sea breeze, making it enjoyable even in July. 
Average conditions in July are:  water temperature 24°C (75°F), air 
temperature min: 22°C (72°F) max: 34°C  (93°F), 13 hours of sun per 
day, no rain fall.
Getting to Rhodes: There are international charter flights to and from 
most European cities, as well as to and from the rest of the world. 
Moreover, there are daily flights from Athens, Heraklion and Thessaloniki 
and less frequent connections with the neighboring islands of 
Kastellorizo, Karpathos and Kassos. As July is in the high season, 
reserving well in advance (at least 2 months) is highly recommended for 
cheaper fares and availability.
Sea Connections: There are regular ferry lines connecting Rhodes to Athens 
(Piraeus), Thessaloniki, Heraklion, Cyprus and Turkey. Rhodes is also 
connected with all neighboring islands through extensive boat and 
hydrofoil services.
