The First Announcement

In Nov. 2003, Taiwanese young astronomers organized East Asia Young
Astronomers Meeting 2003 (EAYAM 2003), and it was a great success. In
Feb. 2006, East Asia Young Astronomers Meeting 2006 (EAYAM 2006) was
held by Japanese young astronomers, and invited young astronomers in
four of the EAMA core regions, China, Japan, Korea and Taiwan. That
meeting encouraged the interaction among young astronomers of
neighboring regions, and provided an opportunity for future
international discussions and interactions.

Here, we are pleased to announce that the East Asian Young Astronomers
Meeting 2008 (EAYAM 2008) will be held in Jiayuguan of Gansu, China
from July 27 to August 1, 2008. We choose Jiayuguan as our meeting
place because a total solar eclipse will occur on August 1. The main
topic of the meeting is "From Stellar to Large-scale structure" and be
divided into following three components.

1. Star Formation and Evolution
2. Formation and Evolution of Galaxies
3. New Technology of Telescopes and Instruments

The talks related with Sun are also welcome. One or two famous
astronomers from each region will be invited for a talk.

The meeting is organized by Chinese young astronomers, and young
astronomers from four of the EAMA regions, China, Japan, Korea and
Taiwan are welcome.

Considering the funding for this meeting, about 20 participants from
each region will be allowed. Postdocs and graduate students are
encouraged to join. We will provide meals and accommodations during
the meeting. We could not provide the travel spending between your
home and China. After your arriving in China, you have some choices to
get to Jiayuguan, the details are presented in Location part of
website and the cost is not expensive.
