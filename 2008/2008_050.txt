                     Second Asian Radio Astronomy School
                       Aug 18-22, 2008 at ASIAA, Taipei

                             First Announcement

Dear colleagues,

	We are pleased to announce the Second Asian Radio Astronomy
  School to be held on August 18-22, 2008 at Academia Sinica, Institute
  of Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA) in Taipei, Taiwan.

	With the advance and growing number of both ground- and space-
  based interferometric array facilities at radio, millimeter, and
  submillimeter wavelengths, observational radio astronomy, particularly
  at high angular resolution, has become increasingly important.  
Sponsored
  by ASIAA, this school is intended for students and scientists with  
strong
  interests in carrying out research with radio interferometric  
facilities.
  Basic knowledge in radio astronomy is preferred but not required  
for the
  attendants. The program will include lectures on the fundamentals  
of radio
  interferometry and a number of selected facilities such as VERA,  
VSOP-2,
  SMA, and ALMA, as well as hands-on exercises with real observational
  data. All sessions will be conducted in English.

	Due to the lecture hall and lodging capacity, the number of
  attendant is limited to 100 people. Should there be too many  
applicants,
  priority will be given to applicants from Taiwan, Japan, and the East
  Asian region.

	ASIAA will provide shared accommodation for participants (except
  those from Taipei city/county) during the school period from Aug  
17th to
  Aug 22th. Lunches and a banquet will also be arranged. Overseas
  participants are expected to meet their own travel and other expenses.

	Related information can be found on the school web page at
  https://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/act/radio_school/2008/.
  Iquiries regarding the school can be made to the following e-mail
  address, radio_school@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw
	On-line registration will open on April 15th, 2007.

  Important Dates :

   March 26, 2007   : First Circular
   April 15, 2007   : Second Circular; Tentative lecture program;
                    : Online registration opens
   June 15, 2007    : Registration Deadline
   June 30, 2007    : Selection and announement of attendees (if  
necessary)
   August 01, 2007  : Final circular; Lecture material online
   August 18, 2007  : School begins

  Organizing Committee (in alphabetic order) :

   Vivien Chen (NTHU)
   Yoshiaki Hagiwara (Space VLBI, NAOJ)
   Tomoya Hirota (VERA, NAOJ)

Dear All,

We are going to have two talks (One about brown dwarfs and another about plasma) this Fri.  Anyone 
who is interested on talking with speakers can join our refreshment section (after 15.00) or lunch 
(say, 12.00 wait outside the elevators, 10 F).

*******************  Astronomy Colloquium  ************************
***************  Institute of Astronomy, NCU  ***********************  
03,28,2008 11:00-12:00 
Speaker: Dr. Chung-Sang Ng
The million-degree solar corona: How can it get so hot?		
S4-1013
The solar corona is basically the atmosphere of the sun, only that it is made out of plasma 
(hightemperature ionized gas). One of the greatest mysteries in solar physics is how the solar corona 
can be heated up to millions of degrees (Kelvins) while the photosphere (surface of the sun) is only 
about six thousands degrees. Since the photosphere is much denser than the corona, its fluid motion 
carries enough free energy to account for the heating rate. The problem becomes how to convert the 
free energy of the photosphere to heat the corona. Over the years, there have been many coronal 
heating theories. Many of them make use of the observed magnetic field as a medium for such 
energy conversion. In this talk, I will give a brief introduction of this problem, and describe some 
results from our theoretical investigation of this problem.

03,28,2008 14:00-15:00 
Speaker: Dr. Sujan Sengupta
Polarization probes the dusty atmosphere of brown dwarfs			
S4-1013
Brown dwarfs enhabits the realm intermediate to less massive stars and giant planets. Depending on 
their spectra, they are divided into two classes, the relatively hotter brown dwarfs belong to L dwarfs 
and the brown dwarfs with clear signature of methane belong to T dwarfs. Due to incomplete 
gravitational settling, the atmosphere of L dwarfs contains condensates of various species with grain 
size ranging from sub-micron to a few tens of micron. In the present talk, I'll discuss how scattering 
of radiation by dust particles gives rise to linear polarization in the optical and the observed 
polarization data constrains the physical properties of dust as well as the oblateness of the 
photosphere of L dwarfs.

              CFHT-Taiwan User's Meeting, 11 April 2008


Dear Taiwan CFHT Users,

Since 2004, Taiwan's access to the Canadian-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) has
been open to Taiwan's astronomical community.  Since then and up to the end of
2007, more than 60 proposals have been granted observing time, and a large
fraction of these proposals
successfully executed.  To date, there are only 2 publications based on these
observations with the CFHT.

To stimulate the community to first look at and then publish their data, and
to identify problems that may stand in the way of doing this, we are calling a
CFHT User's meeting on 11 April 2008, from 10 am to 12:30 pm (the time may be
adjusted slightly if necessary), in Room 718 (conference room) at the ASIAA. 
We anticipate that the format of this meeting will comprise primarily 15-20
min talks, followed by an open forum to discuss issues that Taiwan's CFHT
User's community would like to raise.

We strongly encourage all Taiwan astronomers with useful CFHT data to present
talks.  Even if the scientific interpretation is in its very early stages,
show your results and explain what else needs to be done.  Prompt analyses and
publication of previous CFHT observations is one criteria that the Taiwan CFHT
TAC will increasingly use to grant
observing time.  Please let Paul Hsieh (bchsieh@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw) known if
you would like to attend, and the title of your talk, by 5 pm on 3 April.

sincerely,
Jeremy Lim (PI, Taiwan CFHT Program)
Shiang-Yu Wang(co-PI, Taiwan CFHT Program)
Paul Bau-Ching Hsieh (Chair, Taiwan CFHT User's Committee)
