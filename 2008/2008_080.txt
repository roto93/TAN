Dear all,

This week (including next Wednesday) we have 1 regular and 2 special 
colloquium talks. Dr. Yoichi Ohyama is our long-term visiting scholar 
and this Friday (5/23) he is going to present a talk titled

"AKARI Mid-infrared Spectroscopic Views of Galaxies out to z~0.5".

Professor Frank Shu is paying a short visit to IAA between 5/20 and 5/28 
and this time he is going to present 2 special talks:

"Magnetized Star Formation: Disks, Jets, and Funnel Flows" (this 
Thursday 5/22 2:00 pm)

"The ISM of Nearby Galaxies and the Future of the SMA"  (next Wednesday 
5/28 1:30 pm)

Note that the talk on 5/28 is at 1:30 pm.  Please mark your calendar and 
remember to join the event.

Dear All,

The talk on this Friday is as following. Anyone who is interested on talking 
with speakers can join our refreshment section (after 15.00) or lunch (say, 
12.00 wait outside the elevators, 10 F).

Title:
Non-thermal emissions from Pulsar wind of PSR B1259-63 in binary system

Speaker:
Dr. Jumpei Takata
ASIAA/NTHU

Date:
05,23,2008
(month,day,year) 

Time:
14:00-15:00

Place: S4-1013

The pulsar wind nebula are still mystery in high-energy astrophysics. We have not understood the 
particle acceleration mechanism at the shock, where the pulsar wind interacts with the ambient, the 
energy conversion mechanism from the magnetic energy to kinetic energy (so called sigma paradox), 
and TeV emission mechanism. Binary system composed a young pulsar PSR B1259-63 and a Be star 
SS 2883 is another way to study the pulsar wind. From this system, non-pulsed and non-thermal 
emissions have been detected from radio to TeV bands. We discuss the implication of the recent 
observations with a theoretical model, which invokes the non-thermal emissions from pulsar wind 
particles interacting with stellar wind.

Dear all, 

Dr. Fumi Yoshida and Prof. Takashi Ito will visit Institute of Astronomy, NCU 
this week. During their stay, they are kind to promise to give us talks about 
their research at our group meeting (small body club). Basically, these talks 
will be started on 16:00, May 27 at room s4-901-1 (Science Building IV, 9th 
floor, Planetary Science Lab). Each talk will be about 30 minutes. We are 
pleased to welcome anyone who interests in their topics to join. 

The titles of their topics are: 

"Asymmetric impacts of near-Earth asteroids on the Moon"
by Prof. Takashi Ito
Assistant Professor, National Astronomical Observatory of Japan 

"An insight into the solar system history through the size distribution of 
Jupiter's Trojans" 
by Dr. Fumi Yoshida 
Postdoc, National Astronomical Observatory of Japan 

Thanks, 

Hsiang-Fu Huang
Research Assistant, Institute of Astronomy, NCU
