Dear Prof. Kuan, 

Would you please circulate this information?  Thanks in advance.

Lulin One-meter Telescope (LOT) !X Call for Observing Proposals for 2009A 

Proposal Deadline !X December 31st, 2008 

The Lulin One-meter Telescope (LOT) solicits observing proposals for the 
semester of 2009A.  *** The new semester begins on February 1st, 2009 and 
ends on July 31st ,2009. *** 

Those who are interested in applying for observing time can download the 
proposal form from the web page: 

http://www.lulin.ncu.edu.tw/lot/lot_apply.doc 

and submit the proposal to the following email address: 
(*** PLEASE USE THE KEYWORD "LOT-2009A-YOUR_NAME" IN YOUR E-MAIL SUBJECT 
LINE ***) 

tac_lulin@astro.ncu.edu.tw 

with a copy to the TAC chair to avoid occasional erroneous delivery: 

yichou@astro.ncu.edu.tw 

by midnight, December 31st, 2008, Taiwan time (UT+8).  The allocation of 
observing time will be announced before January 20th, 2009.  In addition to 
the research proposals, we will also consider educational projects for 
advanced astronomical observation courses. 

Instruments Available: 

There are two instruments available, the Lulin CCD Imager (LCI) and the 
Lulin Compact Spectrograph (LCS).  The LCI is the major observing instrument 
using the PI-1300B CCD.  The technical information of LCI can be found in 
the following web page: 

http://www.lulin.ncu.edu.tw/lot/1300b.pdf 
http://www.lulin.ncu.edu.tw/Research/paper/pi1300b_chjaa_200505.pdf 

The second instrument, the LCS, has been tested and calibrated during the 
2008.  The calibration of this instrument has been improving but 
has not achieved its expected performance.  Thus observers using this 
instrument are on a shared risk basis.  Users are encouraged to keep in 
close contact with the technical team to receive the updated information.   
Below please find the specifications of LCS:

the sky with LOT optics): 8.5 arcmin Width of slit (projection onto the sky 
with LOT optics): 1.5 arcsec (fixed) Resolving power: 333 @ 500nm (300 
lines/mm) and 1333 @ 500nm (1200 lines/mm)
