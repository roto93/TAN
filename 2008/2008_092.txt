Dear people,

We will have three talks for this week. Anyone who like to have lunch with our speakers is very welcome.

This Wed 14.00: Dr. Sergei A. Levshakov----Some correction in my previous e-mail(see following)
This Thu  14.00: Prof. Sergei Gulyaev     -----I will send a new e-mail about his title and abstract. 
This Fri    14.00: ³¯¼z¯u Hui-Chen Chen-----I will send a new e-mail about her title and abstract. 

Cheers,
Yu-Huei
