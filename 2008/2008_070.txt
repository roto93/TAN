Dear All,

The talks on this Friday are as following. Anyone who is interested on talking 
with speakers can join our refreshment section (after 15.00) or lunch (say,
12.00 wait outside the elevators, 10 F).

*******************  Astronomy Colloquium  ************************
***************  Institute of Astronomy, NCU  ***********************

Title:
Asteroids, Comets and Meteoroids
 
Speaker:
Prof. Shinsuke Abe 阿部新助
IANCU
 
Date:
05,09,2008

Time:
14:00-15:00

Place:
S4-1013

Abstract:
It is of great importance to know evolution of solar system small bodies.
Asteroids that have survived since the early solar system (4.6 Gyr ago) have
experienced numerous collisions that influenced thermal histories and orbital
properties. Thus, the physical nature (size, shape, density, composition and
orbital distribution) of asteroids is fundamental to understanding how our
solar system has been evolved. Some asteroids are in fact either dead or
dormant cometary nuclei. Though an Earth impact of 1 km-size asteroid is
likely within a million years, frequent meteor fireballs or meteorite falls on
Earth are indications of collision (ejection) events. Asteroidal particles
have been proposed as a source of some meteor showers. However, their parent
bodies and dynamical evolution of meteoroids are still subject to debate. In
my talk, I'd like to present topics about Potentially Hazardous Asteroid
Itokawa explored by Japanese spacecraft HAYABUSA, asteroidal Earth-grazing
fireball, cometary/asteroidal meteor spectroscopy and meteoroid's Lunar impact
flush. The Panoramic Survey Telescope And Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS)
project will give us quantitative understanding of the connection among small
bodies and their association with meteoroids that generates new insights of
our solar system.
