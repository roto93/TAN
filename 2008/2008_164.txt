Title:
  Dust in Planetary Systems: the Sun and  Pictoris

Abstract:

Vega-like systems or dust debris disks are characterized by a small amount 
of circumstellar gas, the presence of planetary objects and dust. The 
small solar system objects (trans-Neptunian objects, asteroids, comets, 
and meteoroids) and the interplanetary dust cloud also form a planetary 
debris disk, although the solar system dust density is much lower than for 
the debris disks that are observed around other stars. A large amount of 
observational data, though of different kind, exist for the solar system 
and the Pictoris system. After discussing our basic knowledge of planetary 
disk evolution, this presentation will address the existence of a 
second-generation gas component and the existence of amorphous and 
crystalline silicates in the solar system and around Pictoris.

   The small solar system objects (trans-Neptunian objects, asteroids,

   lower than for the debris disks that are observed around other stars. A

First announcement

The 6th joint meeting of Chinese physicists worldwide (OCPA6) -
International Conference on Physics Education and Frontier
Physics Research


The 6th joint meeting of Chinese physicists worldwide (OCPA6)-
International Conference on Physics Education and Frontier Physics
Research will be organized by the Institute of Modern Physics of the
Chinese Academy of Science, Lanzhou University, and the Overseas
Chinese Physics Association (OCPA) on August 3-7, 2009 in Lanzhou,
China.

The conference continues a series held previously in Shantou (1994),
Taipei (1997), Hong Kong (2000), Shanghai (2004) and Taipei (2006).

The scientific program will feature invited talks in plenary sessions,
invited and contributed talks in parallel sessions. Scientific topics will
cover the latest experimental and theoretical developments in all subareas
of physics. The educational program will cover new progress in
physics education, public outreach, mentoring of undergraduate
students, graduate students and postdoctoral researchers.

The conference will be held on the site of Lanzhou University, located
in the heart of the city of Lanzhou in Gansu province. It is within
walking distance to the famed Yellow River bank.

A website has been set up for the conference and will be updated with
detailed information as it becomes available. The URL is
http://snst.lzu.edu.cn/web1/index.html

Title: X-ray Cooling Flows

Abstract:

Rich clusters of galaxies are immersed in X-ray emitting gas (which 
originated from the Cosmic Web and/or are stripped from infalling gas-rich 
galaxies).  In the absence of strong reheating, the X-ray gas around the 
cluster core should cool on timescales much shorter than the Hubble time, 
and flow towards the center in a phenomenon known as an X-ray cooling 
flow. Although predicted about 40 years ago, subsequent searches for the 
resultant cool gas or its products (stars) have failed to find material at 
quantities anywhere near the predicted levels.  Observations this decade 
show that the X-ray gas around the cluster center is strongly reheated by 
the AGN in the central cD galaxy, and that any X-ray cooling flow is 
weaker than can be currently detected in X-rays.

Nevertheless, an increasing number of central cD galaxies in putative 
X-ray cooling-flow clusters have been found to contain large amounts of 
relatively cool gas, the dominant component of which constitutes cool 
molecular gas traced in CO.  Here, I report our observations of CO in 
Perseus A, the central cD galaxy in the Perseus Cluster, which is one of 
the closest rich galaxy clusters and the X-ray-brightest cluster in the 
sky.  I show that the properties of the cool molecular gas traced in CO is 
consistent with predictions for a X-ray cooling flow, thus providing the 
most direct evidence yet for the existence of a X-ray cooling flow in any 
cluster.  I also describe the relationship between the cool molecular gas 
and other gas components at higher temperatures, and examine the possible 
fate of this gas.

Astronomy Colloquium

Date: Nov 7 (Friday)
Time: 1:30pm
Venue: NTHU Physics Building R620

Speaker: Dr. I-Chun Shih (NTHU)
Title: X-ray binaries in globular clusters
Abstract:
In this talk, I will briefly introduce X-ray binaries in globular
clusters. Globular cluster is a sphere, dense region containing large
number of old population stars, and it has long been considered as an
ideal environment of X-ray binary formation. In the era of Chandra and
XMM-Newton X-ray telescopes, astronomers not only can study galactic
globular clusters X-ray binaries with greater details, but also can
resolve luminous X-ray emitters, most of them are believed to be X-ray
binaries, from nearby galaxies. They probably provide important
knowledge about the evolution of binaries stars, globular clusters, or
even galaxies.

Speaker: Dr. Jason Pun (University of Hong Kong)
Title: Cosmic Explosions: Understanding and Utilizing Supernovae
Abstract:
Supernovae are stellar explosions that occurred during the final
stages of stellar evolution. Supernovae are important objects in the
astronomical world: they create almost all the elements in the
universe, energize the interstellar medium, and serve as yardsticks
for measuring cosmological distances. Our understanding of supernovae
has greatly benefited from both large scale surveys and intensive
studies of a few nearby samples. In this talk, I will introduce the
observational diversity of supernovae and provide some updated results
on Supernova 1987A, the closest supernova observed in 400 years.
