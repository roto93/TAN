The third China-Japan-Korea Hadron and Nuclear Physics 2008 Symposium will be
held from June 23 to 27, 2008 at Institute of Modern Physics (IMP), CAS, in
Lanzhou. This symposium will follow the style of the last two held in Nara,
Japan and Pusan, Korea respectively to provide a forum for physicists of these
countries to discuss the new development on nuclear and hadron physics, aimed
to enhance the collaborations among China, Japan and Korea nuclear physics
community.

The following topics will be focused in this workshop:
(1). Nuclei structure and hypernulcei
(2). Superheavy nuclei
(3). Heavy ion physics
(4). Symmetries in hadronic and nuclear physics
(5). Hadron structure and hadron interactions, exotic hadrons
(6). Hadronic and nuclear astrophysics
(7). Hadronic and quark matter
(8). New facilities and experimental techniques for nuclear and hadronic physics

Please fill out the registration form in the next page and return it to
zhpm@impcas.ac.cn, the dealine for registration is May 10, 2008.

Looking forward to welcoming you in Lanzhou.
