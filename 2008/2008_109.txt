> Subject: [Fwd: [tennet:5983] Subaru Asian Winter School -- 1st circular]]

Dear Yi-Jehng,

I received below the announcement on the opening of
"Subaru Asian Winter School" in Japan organized by
NAOJ/Subaru (December 1-5, 2008).

Could you help to circulate this information over TAN? - Thanks.

This will be an excellent opportunity for young astronomers
to learn data reduction techniques and scientific results
relevant to Subaru.
Their targeted participants are mainly graduate students
from universities/institutes in Asian countries - 20 from Japan
and another 20 from other Asian countries (Taiwan, Korea, China, ..).

The opening for applications will start from August 5.

regards,
Keiichi

                              and
            The Graduate University for Advanced Studies

                       December 1-5, 2008
      National Astronomical Observatory, Mitaka, Tokyo, Japan

[Purposes]

It is our great honor that Subaru Telescope located at the summit of
Mauna Kea in Hawaii (http://subarutelescope.org/index.html) has been
in steady operation for 10 years and continuously producing cutting-
edge results in modern observational astronomy of various areas.

We are pleased to announce here that Subaru Telescope at National
Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ) is going to organize a winter
school that provides graduate students and young astronomers with
an opportunity to learn data analyses and of the scientific results
obtained with Subaru.  The main purpose of this school inviting
students from outside Japan is to promote the use of Subaru Telescope
by wider astronomical community and expect to build up international
collaborations.  Exchange of young students will also form the basis
of our partnership in the future astronomy in Asia.

This winter school is co-sponsord by the Graduate University for
Advanced Studies (GUAS) in which NAOJ is participating for education.
GUAS has been sponsoring Asian Winter Schools for various branches
of science since 2004, and this year, Subaru/NAOJ and GUAS will
jointly host this winter school specifically on optical and
near-infrared astronomy with Subaru.

[Application]

The winter school will offer a series of lectures, experience with
Subaru data, and a half-day trip to the space agency JAXA/ISAS at
Sagamihara, Kanagawa (http://www.isas.ac.jp/e/).
Details of the winter school including the application procedure
will be announced in the second circular scheduled to be sent in
early August.

Supposed participants are mainly graduate students from universities
and institutes in Asian countries, but we hope not to discourage
graduate students and young post-docs working at other areas to
participate as well.  Participants are expected to have some
knowledge and experience of UNIX.  A written reference by his/her
supervisor is mandatory for an application by a graduate student.

The number of participants will be limited to ~20 from abroad and
~20 from Japan at most, and the selection will be made by the
organizers based on the submitted applications if the applications
exceed the above limitations.  Limited travel fund will be available.

[Schedule]

Dec 1 (Mon) open at 13:00, lectures (telescope, instruments), reception
Dec 2 (Tue) lectures (data archives/analysis), data analysis
Dec 3 (Wed) science lectures, excursion to JAXA/ISAS (afternoon)
Dec 4 (Thu) data analysis, banquet
Dec 5 (Fri) data analysis, close at 12:00

*In the data analysis sessions, each participant is supposed to choose
one of the following Subaru instruments: Suprime-Cam, FOCAS, HDS, or IRCS.

[Important Dates] -- provisional!

July 10      : 1st circular (an announcement of the opening of the school)
August 5     : 2nd circular (open for application)
September 15 : deadline for application
September 30 : selection of participants
October 31   : final circular (textbooks/documents distribution)
