Hi Yi-Jehng,

Wednesday and Thursday were our university sports days.  Amid various 
events, I decided to give myself some extra exercise, and came up with the 
following report on the paper statistics of our community, which I thought 
should be interesting to some of the TAN subscribers,

   http://www.astro.ncu.edu.tw/~wchen/pubtaiwan.pdf

Please circulate it.  Thanks.

      		First Announcement on
    "Japan-Taiwan Subaru-HSC Science/Survey Mini Workshop"
                       22 December, 2008
                            Room 716
    Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Taiwan

Dear Colleagues,

ASIAA will host a one-day mini science workshop on the planned large
sky survey with the "Hyper Suprime-Cam" (HSC), which is a next
generation wide-field (1.5deg FoV) prime-focus camera for the Japanese
8.2m Subaru Telescope at the summit of Mauna Kea, Hawaii. Development of
the camera started in 2007 and is planned to be completed in 2012.
ASIAA is an international partner of the Subaru HSC project. All Taiwanese
astronomers are welcome to bring your ideas for the survey and join the survey.
This mini workshop is a pre-meeting for the coming HSC Science/Survey Workshop
jointly held at NAOJ by Japan and Princeton on January 17-20.

This WS will provide an overview and status of the instrument and survey
designs/strategies (wide, deep, ultra-deep) proposed by astronomers in
Japan/Taiwan for different science drivers. The goal of this WS is to put together
ideas of the survey and integrate the different scientific interests into the survey.
Following the presentation sessions, a discussion session will be held to discuss
possible scientific contributions from the Taiwan side, in particular in software
(e.g., analysis pipelines) development. It will also provide the chance to form subgroups
of the survey by both Taiwanese and Japanese astronomers.

A preliminary list of invited speakers is attached below. Everyone is
welcome to attend the WS - please register from our WS website below.
It is also encouraged to talk about the new ideas for the survey. A few slots will be given
for the contributed talks on the new ideas. Please contact Keiichi Umetsu (keiichi@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw)
for this by ** December 7 **.

> Subject: Lulin One-meter Telescope (LOT): Call for Observing Proposals for 2009A 

Dear Prof. Kuan, 

Would you please circulate this information?  Thanks in advance. 

Regards, 
Hung-Chin Lin   

---------------------------------- 

Lulin One-meter Telescope (LOT) !X Call for Observing Proposals for 2009A 

Proposal Deadline !X December 31st, 2008 

The Lulin One-meter Telescope (LOT) solicits observing proposals for the 
semester of 2009A.  *** The new semester begins on February 1st, 2009 and 
ends on July 31st ,2009. *** 

Those who are interested in applying for observing time can download the 
proposal form from the web page: 

http://www.lulin.ncu.edu.tw/lot/lot_apply.doc 

and submit the proposal to the following email address: 
(*** PLEASE USE THE KEYWORD "LOT-2009A-YOUR_NAME" IN YOUR E-MAIL SUBJECT 
LINE ***) 

tac_lulin@astro.ncu.edu.tw 

with a copy to the TAC chair to avoid occasional erroneous delivery: 

yichou@astro.ncu.edu.tw 

by midnight, December 31st, 2008, Taiwan time (UT+8).  The allocation of 
observing time will be announced before January 20th, 2009.  In addition to 
the research proposals, we will also consider educational projects for 
advanced astronomical observation courses. 

Instruments Available: 

There are two instruments available, the Lulin CCD Imager (LCI) and the 
Lulin Compact Spectrograph (LCS).  The LCI is the major observing instrument 
using the PI-1300B CCD.  The technical information of LCI can be found in 
the following web page: 

http://www.lulin.ncu.edu.tw/lot/1300b.pdf 
http://www.lulin.ncu.edu.tw/Research/paper/pi1300b_chjaa_200505.pdf 

The second instrument, the LCS, has been tested and calibrated during the 
2008.  The calibration of this instrument has been improving but 
has not achieved its expected performance.  Thus observers using this 
instrument are on a shared risk basis.  Users are encouraged to keep in 
close contact with the technical team to receive the updated information.   
Below please find the specifications of LCS: 

Lulin Compact Spectrograph (LCS) 

Dispersion element: 2 gratings (300 lines/mm and 1200 lines/mm) 
Detector: Apogee AP-8 (SITE chip, 1K!N1K) Length of slit (projection onto 
the sky with LOT optics): 8.5 arcmin Width of slit (projection onto the sky 
with LOT optics): 1.5 arcsec (fixed) Resolving power: 333 @ 500nm (300 
lines/mm) and 1333 @ 500nm (1200 lines/mm) 
Wavelength coverage: 380-760nm, and 500-900nm (300 lines/mm)
