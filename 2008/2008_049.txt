              CFHT-Taiwan User's Meeting, 11 April 2008


Dear Taiwan CFHT Users,

Since 2004, Taiwan's access to the Canadian-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) has
been open to Taiwan's astronomical community.  Since then and up to the end of
2007, more than 60 proposals have been granted observing time, and a large
fraction of these proposals
successfully executed.  To date, there are only 2 publications based on these
observations with the CFHT.

To stimulate the community to first look at and then publish their data, and
to identify problems that may stand in the way of doing this, we are calling a
CFHT User's meeting on 11 April 2008, from 10 am to 12:30 pm (the time may be
adjusted slightly if necessary), in Room 718 (conference room) at the ASIAA. 
We anticipate that the format of this meeting will comprise primarily 15-20
min talks, followed by an open forum to discuss issues that Taiwan's CFHT
User's community would like to raise.

We strongly encourage all Taiwan astronomers with useful CFHT data to present
talks.  Even if the scientific interpretation is in its very early stages,
show your results and explain what else needs to be done.  Prompt analyses and
publication of previous CFHT observations is one criteria that the Taiwan CFHT
TAC will increasingly use to grant
observing time.  Please let Paul Hsieh (bchsieh@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw) known if
you would like to attend, and the title of your talk, by 5 pm on 3 April.

sincerely,
Jeremy Lim (PI, Taiwan CFHT Program)
Shiang-Yu Wang(co-PI, Taiwan CFHT Program)
Paul Bau-Ching Hsieh (Chair, Taiwan CFHT User's Committee)
