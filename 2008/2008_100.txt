Hi YJ,

CAST received a porforlio detailing the Shaw Laureates in 2008.  The 
award, as announced in June 10 in a press conference in Hong Kong, in 
Astronomy went to Professor Reinhard Genzel (the director of MPE) for
"his outstanding contributions in demonstrating that the Milky Way
contains a supermassive black hole at its centre."

I thought this news would be interested to our community.  Please include 
it in the next issue of TAN.  Thanks.

Wen Ping
