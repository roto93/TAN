                 3rd Biennial Leopoldina Conference on

                            "DARK ENERGY"

                        October 7 - 11, 2008
            Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich, Germany

       website: http://www.mpe.mpg.de/events/dark-energy-2008/

A conference of the German Academy of Sciences 'Leopoldina' and the DFG
Transregional Research Center TR33 'The Dark Universe', with support from
the Munich Excellence Cluster 'Origin and Structure of the Universe'

***************************************************************************

Dear Colleagues,

during the last decade a consistent quantitative picture of the universe
has emerged from a wide range of observations, including the microwave
background, distant supernovae and the large-scale distribution of
galaxies. In this standard model of the universe, normal baryonic matter
contributes only 4% to the overall density, 96% are dark components in the
form of dark matter (26%) and dark energy (70%). Particularly, the
existence and amount of dark energy is completely unexpected and raises
fundamental questions about the foundations of modern physics. Is dark
energy merely a cosmological constant, is it a new kind of particle field
that evolves dynamically with the expansion of the universe, or is a new
law of gravity needed? Observers are intensely analysing current surveys
or design new ones that will illucidate the properties of Dark Energy. At
the same time, theoreticians are producing new ideas about its nature and
possible origin. The conference aims to bring together observers, modelers
and theoreticians from particle physics and astrophysics to present and
discuss latest results and explore possible routes for future research.

The conference website:

http://www.mpe.mpg.de/events/dark-energy-2008/

has just been opened for registration and abstract submission. There you
can also find further information on the program, speakers, conference
venue, travel information etc. We are looking forward to welcome you in
Munich this fall.

For the SOC and LOC,

Ralf Bender, Christof Wetterich and Stefanie Phleps
