Dear all,

Next Monday (1/28) there is an ASIAA/LeCosPA joint colloquium talk by 
Prof. Alan Watson of School of Physics and Astronomy, University of 
Leeds, UK. Alan Watson FRS has been Professor of Physics in Leeds since 
1984. His research interests are in high energy cosmic rays. He has been 
involved in field station experiments in Yorkshire and at the South 
Pole. Currently, he leads an international team in collaboration with 
the Nobel Prize Winner, Professor James Cronin (of the University of 
Chicago and an Honorary Leeds Graduate), which is constructing, in 
Argentina, the largest cosmic ray experiment ever built. When completed 
it will cover an area the size of Lancashire and will detect the highest 
energy particles in Nature, which are almost certainly of extragalactic 
origin. Professor Watson was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society in 
2000 and is currently a PPARC Senior Research Fellow. Below is the 
detail of his talk:

Title :
Recent Results by Pierre Auger Observatory
Abstract:
In 1938, Pierre Auger and colleagues in Paris discovered that showers of 
cosmic rays can extend over wide areas when they recorded simultaneous 
events in
detectors placed about 30 m apart. Nearly 70 years later, on the pampas 
of western Argentina, a cosmic-ray observatory bearing Auger's name is 
studying
extensive air showers over a much wider area, many times the size of 
Paris itself. These showers are generated by particles with far higher 
energies than any man-made accelerator can reach, and they continue to 
challenge our understanding.

In the talk I will briefly describe the motivation for the construction 
of the Pierre Auger Observatory and discuss the latest results on the 
energy spectrum and on the arrival direction distribution at the highest 
energies. some implications for particle physics beyond the LHC will be 
mentioned.
