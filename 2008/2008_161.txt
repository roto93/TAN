Dear Pauchy,

Will you be kind enough to forward the 1st announcement of OCPA6
(attached) to physics colleagues in Taiwan, perhaps through the society
email mailing list if possible?

Thank you very much!

Haiyan

First announcement

The 6th joint meeting of Chinese physicists worldwide (OCPA6) -
International Conference on Physics Education and Frontier
Physics Research


The 6th joint meeting of Chinese physicists worldwide (OCPA6)-
International Conference on Physics Education and Frontier Physics
Research will be organized by the Institute of Modern Physics of the
Chinese Academy of Science, Lanzhou University, and the Overseas
Chinese Physics Association (OCPA) on August 3-7, 2009 in Lanzhou,
China.

The conference continues a series held previously in Shantou (1994),
Taipei (1997), Hong Kong (2000), Shanghai (2004) and Taipei (2006).

The scientific program will feature invited talks in plenary sessions,
invited and contributed talks in parallel sessions. Scientific topics will
cover the latest experimental and theoretical developments in all subareas
of physics. The educational program will cover new progress in
physics education, public outreach, mentoring of undergraduate
students, graduate students and postdoctoral researchers.

The conference will be held on the site of Lanzhou University, located
in the heart of the city of Lanzhou in Gansu province. It is within
walking distance to the famed Yellow River bank.

A website has been set up for the conference and will be updated with
detailed information as it becomes available. The URL is
