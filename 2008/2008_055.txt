Dear All,

We are going to have two talks this week. Anyone who is interested on talking with speakers can join 
our refreshment section (after 15.00) or lunch (say, 12.00 wait outside the elevators, 10 F).

The role of relativistic pair plasmas in high-energy astrophysics	
Dr. HIROTANI Kouichi	

Electron-positron pair plasmas offer the key to an understanding of various energetic phenomena 
associated with galactic and extra-galactic compact objects. In this talk, I will pick up two of my 
recent researches in this field: Active galactic nucleus (AGN) jets and gamma-ray pulsars. In the first 
half, I will introduce my new method how to discriminate the matter composition of AGN jets --- do 
they consist of electron-positron pair plasmas or electron-proton normal plasmas? ---, using Very 
Long Baseline Interferometric technique. In the second half, I will turn to my studies on pulsars and 
demonstrate that their high-energy emissions can be uniquely predicted from the first principles 
without any artificial assumptions, if we specify only the following four parameters: neutron star 
rotational period, period derivative, magnetic inclination angle, and the stellar surface temperature.

Quasi-local mass in the Newtonian space time	
吳育慧 Dr. Yu-Huei Wu	

In general relativity, quasi-local energy-momentum expressions have been constructed from various 
formulae. However, Newtonian theory of gravity gives a well known and an unique quasi-local mass 
expression (surface integration). Since geometrical formulation of Newtonian gravity has been 
established in the covariant Newtonian space-time, it provides a covariant approximation from 
relativistic to Newtonian theories. By using this approximation, we calculate Komar integral, Brown-
York quasi-local energy and Dougan-Mason quasi-local mass in the covariant Newtonian space-
time. It turns out that Komar integral naturally gives the Newtonian quasi-local mass expression, 
however, further conditions (spherical symmetry) need to be made for Brown-York and Dougan-
Mason expressions. http://arxiv.org/abs/0803.2194

Accretion-powered Millisecond Pulsars -- Anomalous Pulse Phase Variations and Energy Dependent 
Phase Lag	
周翊 教授 Prof. Yi Chou	

Low Mass X-ray Binaries (LMXBs) are considered to be the progenitor of the millisecond pulsars 
detected in the radio band. However, the attempts to measure coherent millisecond pulsation from 
an LMXB, which provides a direct evolutionary link between radio millisecond pulsar and LMXB, were 
unsuccessful until the discovery of the first accretion-powered millisecond pulsar SAX 1808.4-3658 
in 1998. To date, coherent millisecond pulsations have been detected in ten LMXBs with spin periods 
ranging from 1.67 ms to 5.5 ms. Although the material accreting onto the neutron star through the 
magnetic field lines is from the inner part of the disk, unlike the regular accreting pulsar (hundreds 
of millisecond to several second), their fast rotation speeds and the low magnetic fields (108-109G) 
imply that their radii of the inner disk edges are only several factors larger than the neutron star. 
This different type of accretion can further improve our knowledge for X-ray binaries, as well as the 
nature of the neutron star. In this talk, I will introduce interesting discoveries from our studies for 
several of these accretion-powered millisecond pulsars, including the anomalous pulse phase 
variations and the implication from the abnormal energy dependent phase lag.

Dear all,

This Friday we will have a colloquium talk presented by Dr. Jiwoo Nam, 
who is currently a visiting scholar of CosPA at NTU. Dr. Nam has been 
involved with Antarctic Impulsive Transient Antenna (ANITA), a 
balloon-borne neutrino telescope search for high energy neutrinos 
created by collisions between cosmic rays and the the cosmic microwave 
photons that pervade the Universe. And the title of his talk on 4/11 is

"Neutrino hunting with ANITA experiment"

Please mark your calendar and remember to join the event!

Speaker  : Dr. Jiwoo Nam
Title        : Neutrino hunting with ANITA experiment
Time       : 4/11 (Friday) 2:00 pm
Location : Room 716
