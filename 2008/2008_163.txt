Hi,

Would you please circulate the following information through the TAN? Thanks.

Cheers,
Albert

Astronomy Colloquium
Institute of Astronomy, National Tsing Hua University

Date: Nov 7 (Friday)
Time: 1:30pm
Venue: NTHU Physics Building R620

Speaker: Dr. I-Chun Shih (NTHU)
Title: X-ray binaries in globular clusters
Abstract:
In this talk, I will briefly introduce X-ray binaries in globular
clusters. Globular cluster is a sphere, dense region containing large
number of old population stars, and it has long been considered as an
ideal environment of X-ray binary formation. In the era of Chandra and
XMM-Newton X-ray telescopes, astronomers not only can study galactic
globular clusters X-ray binaries with greater details, but also can
resolve luminous X-ray emitters, most of them are believed to be X-ray
binaries, from nearby galaxies. They probably provide important
knowledge about the evolution of binaries stars, globular clusters, or
even galaxies.

Time: 12:10pm
Venue: NTHU Physics Building R701

Title: Cosmic Explosions: Understanding and Utilizing Supernovae
Abstract:
Supernovae are stellar explosions that occurred during the final
stages of stellar evolution. Supernovae are important objects in the
astronomical world: they create almost all the elements in the
universe, energize the interstellar medium, and serve as yardsticks
for measuring cosmological distances. Our understanding of supernovae
has greatly benefited from both large scale surveys and intensive
studies of a few nearby samples. In this talk, I will introduce the
observational diversity of supernovae and provide some updated results
on Supernova 1987A, the closest supernova observed in 400 years.
