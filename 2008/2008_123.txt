Postdocs and PhD students wanted in the UltraPhot project

The High Energy Astrophysics Group in the Institute of Astronomy, National
Tsing Hua University, is seeking two postdocs and two PhD students to
participate in the UltraPhot project. The UltraPhot project is an NSC-funded
collaboration between NTHU and Paris Observatory to build a multi-fiber fast
(100 Hz) photometer to mount on ESO's VLT UT2. Scientific subjects of this
project include TNO occultation, optical variation of X-ray binaries, white
dwarf oscillation, short-time-scale variation of YSOs, exoplanets, etc.
Two of the postdocs and PhD students will be stationed in Paris for one or
two years during 2009-2011 to join the design, manufacturing, assembling,
and testing of the whole instrument as well as data pipeline construction
and fiber position controller coding.

Those who are interested are welcome to contact Prof. H.-K. Chang at
hkchang@phys.nthu.edu.tw as early as possible.
