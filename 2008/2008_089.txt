simulating galaxy interactions and mergers. On Wednesday (6/4) he is 
going to present a talk titled

"Identikit 1: A Modeling Tool for Interacting Disk Galaxies"

Dr. Youhei Masada is our new post-doctoral research fellow. His main 
research interest includes MHD phenomena in compact objects and solar 
and stellar interior. On Friday (6/6) he is going to talk about
