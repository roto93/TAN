Call for SMA proposals for 2008A

Dear Colleagues,

Proposals are solicited for the ASIAA time of the Submillimeter
Array (SMA) for the period from May 16th, 2008, to November 15th,
2008.  Those who are affiliated to a Taiwanese university or a
Taiwanese research institute are eligible to apply for the ASIAA
SMA time as a principal investigator (PI).

The deadline for proposal submission for the ASIAA SMA time
for the next semester is March 14 (Friday), 2008, 4AM in the
morning (Taiwan time).  [The deadline corresponds to March 13
(Thursday), 2008, 10AM HST in Hawaii, USA.]

All Taiwanese SMA proposals must be submitted through the SMA
submission facility (http://sma1.sma.hawaii.edu/proposing.html,
then click "SMA Project Account").
New proposers in particular need to get registered (through the
submission web site) before submitting a proposal.  All potential
proposers are encouraged to visit the submission facility well
in advance.

When submitting your proposal, please make sure to select
"ASIAA" as your destination TAC in the submission web page.
Please submit your proposal early.  If you encounter any technical
problem with the submission facility, please contact TATSUHIKO
HASEGAWA (hasegawa@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw).

For technical information on the SMA, please visit
    http://sma1.sma.hawaii.edu/proposing.html .
For Taiwan and ASIAA specific aspects (including the ASIAA
proposal selection process and the amount of available
observing time), please visit
    http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/~SMART/ .

The SMA is a complex instrument.  Consultation or collaboration
with those who are familiar with the SMA is highly recommended.
Contact points for consultations are also found in the ASIAA
web page listed above.

Additional messages from the ASIAA SMA TAC :

Subcompact configuration, in addition to the usual Compact, Extented,
and Very-Extended configurations, will be available.  High spectral
resolution (25kHz) will be available.  In addition, 400 GHz
receivers will be available on four or more antennas.  If you would
like to use the 400 GHz receivers, please state so (and justify)
in the proposal.

The PI of a successful proposal will be encouraged to provide an
observer at the summit of Mauna Kea.  For more detail, please
consult the ASIAA web page listed above.

In order to encourage PhD students to use the SMA, the ASIAA SMA TAC
will make some considerations to proposals for PhD thesis projects.
Please visit the ASIAA web site for details.

In order to make efficient use of SMA data, the ASIAA SMA TAC will expect
Co-Is to follow up the analysis and publication of already executed or
allocated projects under a PI who becomes unable to do the work for
various reasons.  Potential co-investigators should be aware of their
possible responsibilities or obligations.  PIs should make best efforts
to obtain a consent before putting someone's name on a proposal as a
Co-I.

Sincerely,

Tatsuhiko Hasegawa
ASIAA SMA TAC Chair

Attention: Yi-Jehng Kuan, Professor and Chair
---------------------------------------------------

The Department of Earth Sciences of National Taiwan Normal University invites
applications for two faculty positions in observational astronomy starting in
fall 2008. Candidates in all areas of astronomy and astrophysics will be
considered, with the emphasis on observational astronomy. The positions are
expected to be at the Assistant Professor level, but a higher level
appointment may be considered for exceptionally qualified candidates.

We seek astronomers who have ample experience in centimeter, millimeter,
submillimeter and/or infrared observational astronomy. Applicants who are
familiar with interferometric array and can initiate research programs in
current and future facilities such as SMA and ALMA are favored and encouraged
to apply. The Astronomy group of the department has a close research tie with
Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA). NTNU
astronomy faculty currently has access to the SMA, SMT, KP12M and CFHT,
through the ASIAA TAC. The appointees should have a demonstrated record in
research and a commitment to excellence in undergraduate and graduate teaching.
Preference will be given to individuals whose interests, abilities, and
experience benefit our existing programs. Candidates should have a Ph.D. in
Astronomy, Astrophysics, Planetary Sciences, Physics or a closely related
field, and preferably have post-doctoral experience.

Applicants should submit a cover letter, a current CV, a publication list, a
description of how your future research and teaching will contribute to the
overall goals of the School, a photocopy of doctorate diploma, and arrange
three letters of reference sent to Dr. Yi-Jehng Kuan directly at the above
address.  Complete applications should be received by March 15, 2008 for full
consideration.

FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT

Protostellar Jets in Context
7-11 July 2008, island of Rhodes, Greece.

Protostellar Jets in Context is an international astrophysics conference 
organized  at the initiative of the JETSET  European Research and 
Training Network (RTN) (www.jetsets.org).  It will take place from July 
7-11, 2008 inclusive on the island of Rhodes, Greece. The main goal is to 
review the recent contributions of theoretical and computational 
modelling, high-resolution observations, and laboratory experiments to our 
understanding of jets and outflows from young stars. The connection with 
accretion disks and the similarities with outflow phenomena in other 
astrophysical contexts will also be explored. Members of the European RTN 
Molecular Universe and Constellation are also welcome to participate with 
their coordinators serving as members of the Scientific Organising 
Committee.

Topics to be discussed include:

The jet/wind-launching region: Theories, observations, and numerical 
simula-tions that address the origin of atomic and molecular jets and 
winds in young stars, the physics of the star/disk interaction zone, the 
connectiion with accre-tion disks and the role of jets in removing angular 
momentum.
The propagation, cooling, stability, and environmental impact of jets on 
scales from the stellar envelope to the parent cloud. Large-scale 
numerical simula-tions of collimated outflows including AMR  codes and 
cluster/grid technolo-gies. Observations and models of bipolar outflows, 
from the X-ray to the submm regime. The origin of knots in jets.  
Laboratory experiments that  reproduce, in a scaled manner, key aspects 
of the dynamics of astrophysical jets relevant to their formation, 
collimation and interaction with the interstellar medium.  Experimental 
benchmarks for HD and MHD codes and radiative transfer in jets.
Similarities and differences between protostellar jets and their 
astrophysical siblings, for example coronal jets, outflows in planetary 
nebulae, pulsar jets, jets from symbiotic stars and compact binaries, as 
well as the collimated large-scale relativistic outflows associated with 
AGNs and GRBs.
The conference aims to bring together scientists working in these various 
fields to stimulate cross-disciplinary exchange. It will contain both 
invited and contributed talks, as well as poster sessions. Proceedings 
will be published.

Conference Venue and Accomodation:
The conference will take place in the grounds of the international 
convention center of the Rodos Palace http://www.rodos-palace.gr/, a 
5-star resort hotel set in a singular location in one of the most alluring 
destinations of the Mediterranean.  A special room rate has been 
negotiated for participants at 130 (single)/160 (double)  Euros/night. 
Advance booking is available through the conference website. High speed 
on-line Internet connection will be available to hotel guests.
Climate: In Rhodes, the Mediterranean summer heat is offset by a cooling, 
and sometimes strong, sea breeze, making it enjoyable even in July. 
Average conditions in July are:  water temperature 24°C (75°F), air 
temperature min: 22°C (72°F) max: 34°C  (93°F), 13 hours of sun per 
day, no rain fall.
Getting to Rhodes: There are international charter flights to and from 
most European cities, as well as to and from the rest of the world. 
Moreover, there are daily flights from Athens, Heraklion and Thessaloniki 
and less frequent connections with the neighboring islands of 
Kastellorizo, Karpathos and Kassos. As July is in the high season, 
reserving well in advance (at least 2 months) is highly recommended for 
cheaper fares and availability.
Sea Connections: There are regular ferry lines connecting Rhodes to Athens 
(Piraeus), Thessaloniki, Heraklion, Cyprus and Turkey. Rhodes is also 
connected with all neighboring islands through extensive boat and 
hydrofoil services.
