Dear Colleagues, 
    As mentioned in the last Call for CFHT-Taiwan Proposals, the CFHT-Taiwan 
Time Assignment Committee (TAC) will be giving increasing weight to the status 
of previously executed projects in allocation of future observing time on the 
telescope.  Prompt publication of already executed projects is vital for the 
scientific health of our community, and necessary to secure future funding to 
support our use of the CFHT. 
    To help the PIs, TAC, and entire Taiwan community keep track of the status 
of individual projects, a WEB page has been created to allow individual PIs to 
record the current status of their projects.  Please do so before 27 Oct 2008, 
the date of the next CFHT-T User's Meeting.  Note also that the next CFHT-T 
TAC meeting is anticipated for 3 November 2008. 

    If you are a member of the ASIAA, you can access the WEB page by following 
the instructions below. 

IAA home page -> OIR -> CFHT observations -> Semester (ie. 2008A) -> Project 
Status 
-> Status of CFHT Projects for ASIAA Users 

or use the link: 

https://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/Internal/cfht_project/ListStatus.php 

Please update your personal project status and here we explained the meaning 
of selected fields. 

Processing : the date your data are processed. 
Stacking   : the date your data are stacked. 
Delivery   : the date you get your data (by FTP or tape). 
Analyzed   : the date you (expect to) finish the data analysis. 

Paper Status: 
   Please fill in the paper status by selecting the stage you are right now. If
you are going to merge different project(s) to publish a paper or publish 
another paper(s) with this dataset, please write down your comment in the 
field "Note".

Dear Yi-Jehng

Please circulate the NCU colloquium this Friday.  Thanks.

Title: Results from The First Two-Year Data of the TAOS Project

Abstract:

The Taiwanese-American Occultation Survey (TAOS) aims to search for stellar 
occultation by small (> 1 km) Kuiper-belt objects (KBOs) by collecting huge 
amount of stellar photometric measurements (~10^9) with 3 telescopes.  The 
photometric data produced by a custom aperture photometry are analysed by a 
statistical method which is efficient to detect brief occultation events in 
multi-telescope data.  No statistically significant events were found in the 
first two years of data.  However, the null detection allows us to set a 
stringent upper bound to the size distribution of KBOs.  In this talk, the 
aperture photometry and event detection algorithm will be shown and a detection 
efficiency test and a estimation of the upper bound will be described.

Dear all,

Professor Laird Thompson of UIUC is going to visit IAA on 9/29 and 30. Professor
Thompson's research work has spanned from extragalactic astronomy in early years,
particularly in clusters of galaxies, galaxy morphology and galaxy redshift surveys, to
instrumentation. Since 1990 he has been working in adaptive optics. Next Tuesday (9/30)
he is going to present a talk titled 

"Detecting the Atmospheres of Extrasolar Planets"

Please mark your calendar and remember to join the event.
