Title: Grand Challenges of the 21st Century: Global Change and the Energy Crisis

Abstract:

We discuss the pros and cons of biofuels, photovoltaics, wind, ocean 
currents, ocean waves, geothermal heat, tides, hydroelectric generation, 
nuclear fusion, and nuclear fission as alternative energy sources to fossil 
fuels. Photovoltaics hold promise as a long-term resource if costs can be 
driven down enough so that their installation on a large scale does not eat 
up half of worldwide GDP. However, reliability as the base load dictates 
nuclear power to be the only viable, carbon-friendly, choice possible for 
Taiwan.  Only an aggressive expansion of nuclear power plants can meet, and 
even exceed, the G8 goal of halving the human emission of CO2 by 2050. A 
switch from a plutonium to a thorium economy via molten salt reactors can 
address legitimate concerns about the cost, safety, waste, and potential for 
weapons proliferation of nuclear power. A coherent energy strategy exists 
that can appeal to both developed and developing nations, but nuclear 
activists and environmentalists need to work together to achieve a safer and 
healthier world.
