Dear people,

Sorry to get things online late. Since we have many talks this week, we will have two talks this week 
and move one talk (陳慧真 Hui-Chen Chen)  to the next week. Anyone who'd like to have lunch with 
our speakers is very welcome.

 This week / (1)  6/11(Wed) 14.00: Dr. Sergei A. Levshakov ----See previous e-mail.
                    \ (2)  6/12(Thu)  14.00: Prof. Sergei Gulyaev     ----- See his title and talk as following.
    

 Next week
/   (1) 6/20(Fri)  14.00-15.00: 李昫岱 Dr. Lee, Hsu-Tai 
\   (2) 6/20(Fri)  15.00-16.00: 陳慧真 Hui-Chen Chen-----
           See her title and talk as following.

Astronomy Colloquium 
Institute of Astronomy, NCU

Title:
The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) project: scientific, technical and geopolitical challenges

Speaker:
Prof. Sergei Gulyaev 
New Zealand SKA Project Leader, Director of Institute for Radiophysics and Space Research, School of 
Computing and Mathematical Sciences, Auckland University of Technology

Date:
06,12,2008(Thu)
(month,day,year) 

Time:
14:00-15:00

Place:
S4-1013

The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) represents the next major, and natural, step in radio astronomical 
facilities, providing two orders of magnitude increase in collecting area over existing telescopes. In 
this talk I will outline the key science projects for the SKA and briefly discuss main engineering and 
computational problems. I will also discuss the current status of the SKA and its geopolitical 
challenges.

Astronomy Colloquium Institute of Astronomy, NCU

Title:
Survivability of a star cluster in a dispersing molecular cloud

Speaker:
陳慧真 Hui-Chen Chen
NCU

Date:

(month,day,year) 

Time:
15:00-16:00

Place:
S4-1013

Star clusters are believed to from in molecular clouds. By estimating the ratio of optical clusters to 
embedded cluster, people argued that most of them could not survive for a long time. Dispersion of 
the parent molecular clouds by stellar winds, UV radiation and/or supernova explosions might be the 
main mechanism in this short timescale. In this work we study the effect of the dispersion of 
molecular clouds by N-body simulations. A large set of runs are carried out to investigate the 
parameter space. The ending time of simulations are set as 30 Myr in every case since the lifetime of 
molecular clouds is usually from 10 to 30 Myr. In our results, the survivability of a star cluster is 
related to the mass ratio of the cluster to the entire system ( the cluster and the cloud) in a certain 
region ( radius). Different dispersion rates are compared to different radii. An embedded cluster 
seems not easy to disrupt if the parent cloud is less massive or more extensive. By the robust result 
in our study, the survivability could be predict if the initial conditions of the cluster and the cloud are 
known.

Dear all,

This week some of us are going to enjoy the outing, but most are surely 
going to work hard! For Friday's colloquium we have Dr. Sergei Levshakov 
from  Ioffe Physico-Technical Institute of Russia, who is currently 
visiting Academia Sinica. The title of his talk is

"QSO spectra in cosmological tests"

Please mark your calendar and remember to join the event.
