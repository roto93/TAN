Dear all,

This Friday 8/8 2pm Professor Frank Shu (UC San Diego) is to give a joint NTU
Physics/ASIAA talk on

"Global Change and Energy Crisis: Analyses and Solutions".

Professor Shu is a renowned astrophysicist world wide. His outstanding academic and
research record has won him numerous awards and honors. He is also a fellow of National
Academy of Science of the US and Academia Sinica of Taiwan. This Friday he will give his
insight into the issue facing this generation of mankind. So please mark your calendar
and remember to join the event!

Also note that the colloquium talk will be held in Room 104 of NTU Physics Department,
not the usual Room 716.

-------Joint NTU Physics/ASIAA Colloquium---------------
Title: Global Change and Energy Crisis: Analyses and Solutions
Speaker: Professor Frank Shu (UC San Diego)
Time : 8/8 Friday 2pm
Location: NTU Physics Building Room 104
Broadcast: NOT available
Abstract: 
We analyze the implications of the recent G8 targets on the reductions in
carbon dioxide emissions for 2050 in terms of the changes needed in global and local
energy usage. We then review in a first principles manner the physics behind biofuels,
photovoltaics, wind, surf, geothermal, tides, hydroelectric, nuclear fission, and
nuclear fusion as alternative energy sources to fossil fuels. We demonstrate why only
an aggressive expansion of nuclear power plants can meet the 2050 G8 goal, although
photovoltaics holds promise as a long-term resource if costs can be driven down enough
so that their installation on a large scale does not eat up almost half of worldwide
GDP. Even if cost were not a factor, land use dictates that nuclear power is the only
viable, carbon-friendly, choice possible for Taiwan. We analyze the plan put forward
by Greenpeace and the European Renewable Energy Council and show that the use of only
renewable energy sources to meet the G8 goal would cause massive harm to the natural
environment and still be unresponsive to the economic aspirations of developing
nations. We present new ideas in nuclear power technology that can address legitimate
concerns about its cost, safety, waste, and potential for weapons proliferation. We
summarize by giving a coherent energy strategy that can appeal to developed and
developing nations alike, but that requires environmentalists and nuclear activists to
work together for a safer and healthier world.
