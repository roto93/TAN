Title: Periodicity Search for Possible Counterparts to Radio-quiet
        Gamma-ray Pulsar

Abstract:

Periodicity search in gamma-ray data is usually difficult because of the 
small number of detected photons. A periodicity in the timing signal of 
other energy bands from the counterpart of the gamma-ray source may help 
to establish the periodicity in the gamma-ray emission and therefore 
strengthen the identification of the source in different energy bands. It 
may, however, still be difficult to find the period directly from X-ray 
data such as the case of radio-quiet gamma-ray pulsars. We develop a 
procedure, by cross-checking at least two X-ray data sets, to find 
candidate periods for some specified sources. To avoid a blind search with 
a huge number of trials, these candidate periods can serve as the target 
periods for future search when new data become available. We present some 
example results of this method, which are helpful for finding the next 
radio-quiet gamma-ray pulsars. Several X-ray counterparts to GeV sources 
were studied in this work. Based on the results of our timing analysis, 
inferred physical properties of these possible radio-quiet gamma-ray 
pulsars are compared with the existing gamma-ray pulsars. We suggest that 
the cause of Geminga being radio-quiet is geometric, instead of intrinsic.
