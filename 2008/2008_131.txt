Reminder: Closing date for SMA proposal submission for 2008B

Dear Colleagues,

This is a reminder that the closing date and time for SMA proposals
is September 12 (Friday), 2008, 4AM (Taiwan time) in the morning for the
2008B semester.  [The closing date corresponds to September 11 (Thursday),
10AM Hawaii time.]  Those who are affiliated to a Taiwanese university
or a Taiwanese research institute are eligible to apply for the ASIAA
SMA time as a principal investigator (PI).

All Taiwanese SMA proposals must be submitted through the SMA
submission facility (http://sma1.sma.hawaii.edu/proposing.html,
then click "SMA Project Account").
New proposers in particular need to get registered (through the
submission web site) before submitting a proposal.  All potential
proposers are encouraged to visit the submission facility well
in advance.

When submitting your proposal, please make sure to select
"ASIAA" as your destination TAC in the submission web page.
Please submit your proposal early.  If you encounter any technical
problem with the submission facility, please contact TATSUHIKO
HASEGAWA (hasegawa@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw).

For technical information on the SMA, please visit

For Taiwan and ASIAA specific aspects (including the ASIAA

The SMA is a complex instrument.  Consultation or collaboration
with those who are familiar with the SMA is highly recommended.
Contact points for consultations are also found in the ASIAA
web page listed above.

The ASIAA SMA TAC is offering to help SMA users improve their
SMA proposals.  If you would like to get advices on your proposal,
please send your draft (before submission) to

Sincerely,

Tatsuhiko Hasegawa
