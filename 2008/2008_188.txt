Title: Star Formations in Interacting Galaxy Pairs

Abstract: Interacting galaxy pair is one of the most fundamental brick to 
explore the formation and evolution of galaxies.  We have obtained Spitzer 
IRAC (3.6-8 um) and MIPS (24, 70, 160um) maps for a K-band selected sample 
of close major-merger pairs of galaxies from the joint 2MASS/SDSS 
database.  This is to provide a local benchmark for studies of evolution 
of major-merger galaxies. The parent sample (46 pairs) is complete, 
consisting of all physical pairs (in 3000 deg2) with the primary brighter 
than K = 12.5, projected separations of 5 < r < 20 h-1kpc and stellar mass 
ratios < 2.5 (major-mergers).  We also have Ha/Hb observations as another 
star formation indicator by Palamar 200 inch Hale Telescope.  We use 
Stellar Synthesis Model to fit the star formation history and dust 
extinction.  Preliminary result would be presented in this talk.
