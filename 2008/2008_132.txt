ARO: Call for Proposals (Fall 2008)
------------------------------------

Dear all,

ASIAA's ARO proposal deadline for Fall 2008 (October 01 - January 31)
is set on September 16, 2008 (Tuesday).

The Arizona Radio Observatory operates the Sub-Millimeter Telescope (SMT)
and the Kitt Peak 12 Meter.  The SMT currently supports a dual-polarization,
ALMA Band-6 1 mm receiver, a dual-polarization 0.8 mm receiver, and a new
ALMA Band-9 (602-720 GHz) dual-polarization receiver.   The 12 m supports
2 mm and 3 mm (65-176 GHz) dual-polarization receivers.  A new ALMA Band-3
receiver will be available at the 12 m for the 85-116 GHz band (3 mm HI),
also dual-polarization. Remote observing is available at both ARO telescopes.

Please refer to http://aro.as.arizona.edu/ for more information on
observations and for the latest system status of the telescopes.
People are required to use the KP12M and SMT proposal cover/summary
sheets for their proposals:
(under "Proposal Submission Information" at
  http://aro.as.arizona.edu/proposal_submission_information.htm
for the SMT -
  http://aro.as.arizona.edu/proposals/smt_prop_sub.htm
and for the 12m -
  http://aro.as.arizona.edu/proposals/12m_prop_sub.htm )

Proposals should consist of the standard proposal cover sheet and
a scientific and technical justification. The justification may be
up to two pages of text, and should not exceed three pages including
tables, figures and references.  For electronic submission, ASIAA
only accepts proposals in either PS or PDF format.

Please submit your proposals by 24:00 midnight September 16, 2008 to
kuan@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw ; no late proposals will be accepted.


Kind regards,
Yi-Jehng Kuan
on behalf of the ASIAA ARO TAC

Reminder: Closing date for SMA proposal submission for 2008B

Dear Colleagues,

This is a reminder that the closing date and time for SMA proposals
is September 12 (Friday), 2008, 4AM (Taiwan time) in the morning for the
2008B semester.  [The closing date corresponds to September 11 (Thursday),
10AM Hawaii time.]  Those who are affiliated to a Taiwanese university
or a Taiwanese research institute are eligible to apply for the ASIAA
SMA time as a principal investigator (PI).

All Taiwanese SMA proposals must be submitted through the SMA
submission facility (http://sma1.sma.hawaii.edu/proposing.html,
then click "SMA Project Account").
New proposers in particular need to get registered (through the
submission web site) before submitting a proposal.  All potential
proposers are encouraged to visit the submission facility well
in advance.

When submitting your proposal, please make sure to select
"ASIAA" as your destination TAC in the submission web page.
Please submit your proposal early.  If you encounter any technical
problem with the submission facility, please contact TATSUHIKO
HASEGAWA (hasegawa@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw).

For technical information on the SMA, please visit
    http://sma1.sma.hawaii.edu/proposing.html .
For Taiwan and ASIAA specific aspects (including the ASIAA
proposal selection process and the amount of available
observing time), please visit
    http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/~SMART/ .

The SMA is a complex instrument.  Consultation or collaboration
with those who are familiar with the SMA is highly recommended.
Contact points for consultations are also found in the ASIAA
web page listed above.

The ASIAA SMA TAC is offering to help SMA users improve their
SMA proposals.  If you would like to get advices on your proposal,
please send your draft (before submission) to
  hasegawa@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw .

Sincerely,

Tatsuhiko Hasegawa
ASIAA SMA TAC Chair
