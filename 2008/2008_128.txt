Dear Prof. Kuan, 

I am Chien-Chang Yen. I worked with prof. Yuan in ASIAA. Could you help us 
distribute the following message EANAM meeting to TANet? Please see the 
following detail. 

Sincerely yours

>                Second Announcement 
> 
> The third East-Asia Numerical Astrophysics Meeting (EANAM2008) will 
> held at Nanjing International Conference Hotel 
> (http://www.nic-hotel.com/) from the 10th to 13th of November, 2008. 
> 
> Program: The participants are advised to arrive at the hotel on 
> November 9 and leave on November 14. The preliminary program will 
> available at the conference website 
> http://cosmology.pmo.ac.cn/eanam2008/ after Sept.16; 
> 
> Registeration: The registeration is open until September 15, 2008. A 
> later registeration is possible, but we can not guarantee the 
> reservation of a room for you in the above hotel. 
> 
> Contributed talks: there are some slots left for contributed 
> talks. Please go to the conference website to submit your talks 
> before Sept.15. 
> 
> Transportation: You can reach Nanjing by flights to Nanjing 
> International Airport. In case you find that the flights to Nanjing 
> are not as frequent and inexpensive as those to Shanghai 
> International Airports (Pudong or Hongqiao), you may choose a flight 
> to Shanghai. If you fly to Shanghai, you can take a fast train to 
> Nanjing for about 2 hours 20 minutes. The train departs from 
> Shanghai about every 30-60 minutes. More detailed directions will be 
> given in the final announcement before the meeting. 
> 
> Information for Visa: Non-Chinese nationals are usually required to 
> have a valid visa to enter into China. Up to now, we know that people 
> with a valid Japanese passport can stay in China for less than 15 
> days without a visa. Please inquire the information in a Chinese consult 
> near to your residence. To apply for a short-term business trip visa, 
> you need an official invitation letter.  If you need this document, 
> please send an email to shao973@shao.ac.cn. We expect to send out the 
> invitation letter on Sept. 15. 
> 
> Conference Website: http://cosmology.pmo.ac.cn/eanam2008/. We found 
> the website was frequently down because of the newwork problem at 
> PMO. In case you want to contact us, please send an email to 
> shao973@shao.ac.cn.

> You can find complementary information about the meeting in the first

>                  The first announcement 
> 
> With the rapid development of astronomical observations, 
> sophisticated numerical modeling is becoming a necessary tool in 
> order to deeply understand fundamental physical processes operating 
> in the Universe. There are now growing interests in the astronomical 
> community of East Asia region to develop numerical astrophysics 
> research. To exchange the new research results and to increase the 
> cooperation in this dynamic research field among the scientists in 
> the region, the biennial EAST-ASIA NUMERICAL ASTROPHYSICS MEETING 
> (EANAM), was set up in December, 2003 in Taipei. The first two 
> meetings were held in Tokyo, Japan (Nov. 2004) and in Daejong, Korea 
> (Nov. 2006) respectively. The current meeting is the third of the series. 
> 
> The meeting will cover research topics from the numerical simulations 
> of stars and planets to those of large scale structures of the 
> Universe. It will also focus on the computer sciences: numerical 
> methods, methods of simulation, special-purpose computers and their 
> development, optimization to use large-scale cluster, and so on. The 
> program will consist of invited talks, contributed talks and 
> posters. There will be fairly large amount of time allocated for 
> contributed talks, so young participants are especially encouraged to 
> contribute.  The meeting will organize a half-day guided tour in 
> Nanjing city and leave another half-day to the participants for their 
> self-exploration around the city. 
> 
> A registration fee of 150 USD will be charged to each 
> participant. However, a fairly large amount of grants has been 
> allocated to provide support for the registration, travel and living 
> expenses of young researchers and graduate students from Asian 
> countries. We hope that finance is not an issue for those actively 
> working in the field to attend the meeting. In order to determine how 
> much support is needed, an early registration is requested. Those who 
> ask for the travel support from the meeting must register at the 
> website http://cosmology.pmo.ac.cn/eanam2008/ before May 30, 2008. We 
> will notify the applicants about the financial support before June 
> 30, 2008.
