Hi Yi-Jehng,

Wednesday and Thursday were our university sports days.  Amid various 
events, I decided to give myself some extra exercise, and came up with the 
following report on the paper statistics of our community, which I thought 
should be interesting to some of the TAN subscribers,

Please circulate it.  Thanks.
