> CARMA Call for Proposals, Semester 2008B
> Deadline: 13 March 2008
> Proposals for observations using CARMA during the period 1 July to  
> 31 December 2008 are due on 13 March 2008. CARMA comprises 15  
> antennas operating at 1mm and 3mm on a 2200m elevation site, Cedar  
> Flat, in the Inyo Mountains of California. Proposals will be  
> accepted for the B, C, D, and E antenna configurations. These  
> configurations have resolution 0.35", 0.8", 2", 5" at 230 GHz.
>
> CARMA is operated by the Universities of California (Berkeley),  
> Illinois, and Maryland, and the California Institute of Technology,  
> under a cooperative agreement with the University Radio Observatory  
> program of the National Science Foundation. Approximately 30% of  
> the observing time will be awarded to PIs outside the partner  
> universities.
>
> Proposals should be submitted using the electronic form at http:// 
> carma.astro.uiuc.edu/proposals/ before 17:00 CDT 13 March, 2008.  
> Detailed information, including sensitivities and proposal  
> submission instructions, are available at http://www.mmarray.org .  
> Questions may also be addressed to Dr. Nikolaus Volgenau (volgenau  
> @ mmarray.org).
>
> Note: Several CARMA system enhancements are underway. From time to  
> time during this period, system upgrades may impact our ability to  
> schedule all advertised combinations of wavelength and array  
> configurations.

> What's new for 2008B
>
> - New 3mm receivers are being installed on all antennas. These have  
> wider a IF range and will permit simultaneous observation of new  
> combinations of spectral lines such as 12CO and 13CO (see the  
> correlator configuration tool for semester 2008B).
>
> - The compact E configuration will be offered for the first time  
> (see CARMA memo 20).
>
> - The sensitivity calculator now estimates track lengths in the  
> same way they will typically be scheduled.
