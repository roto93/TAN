Subject: #2 A message from Prof. Chi Yuan (forwarded)

People suggested me to post the following message from Chi to TAN and
share the joy to all TANists.  I think that's a wonderful idea.
Sorry, Chi.  Hope you don't mind:-)  The email was sent on Sept 5th originally.

Dear Colleagues: 
    
    This is the second time in the last 5 days I managed to get on 
computer terminals which can transfer data by e-mail. I haven't figured
out how to connect my home computer to our school of science's server.  
This is why I haven't written anything until today.  

I want to thank all of you for the wonderful party you gave me. The 
gifts, the picture composed by Philippe, the portray created by Typhoon,
the spiral galaxy by a real artist, the food, the drinks, the balloons,
the decoration, ...... I was totally overwhelmed I did not know how to 
react and what to say. Please forgive me if I behaved over-excitedly. 
What a great party, what a great company! 


     The tea garden in "Space Cat" is something else. I enjoyed every
bit of it, except the tea and the food. I knew that some of you wanted 
to see me being "by ping" (drunk). You have missed a good chance, 
because I had only 5 hour sleep in the previous night. With a whole day
working and going to the party, I was already disoriented even before 
my first glass of beer. Thanks to Tim, I-nan and J.C. plus a lot of 
other big beer champions for not forcing me to go for the second 
go-around bottom ups.  Otherwise, I would have collapsed by gravity 
under the beer instability to form a lot of stars in my eyes.

     Too bad we did not go a real bar to get resonantly excited 
afterwards. It would have devastating effects on me, maybe I 
would change myself to become an observer, or an experimentalist.
Who knows! 

     Anyway, I really appreciate what you have done to me. It makes me
sad to leave you at this moment. There is no doubt in my mind that 
IAA will have a great future. You people have made a great choice to
contribute your talents. Hopefully, I will join you soon.

     With wram regards,                  Chi Yuan
