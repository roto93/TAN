Dear Colleagues,
I would like to invite you to give talks in the Intitute of Astromony 
and Astrophysics, Academia Sinica. Currently, there is only one talk 
scheduled in 12/7/96. We have plenty of time for you to present
your research progress and results, and this is also a very good occasion
for you to express yourself and communicate with others. Please don't miss 
this chance, and we will all appreciate your effort to fill one more blank
in our research calender.
If you are interested, please contact me @ (02)652-2020 x229,
or mchen@biaa.sinica.edu.tw. Thanks for your patience.
Cordially,
ming-tang chen
