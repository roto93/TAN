Dear BATC Members and fellow colleagues,  

After a series consultation and discussion with BATC Members, we are finally
able to confirm our meeting dates and place for the 3rd BATC Workshop: 

Time : January 6-8 (Mon-Wed), 1997
Place: Institute of Astronomy, Science IV Building, National Central Univ

According to the agreement of BATC meetings, local host (NCU) will provide
room and board to the meeting participants.  Extended stay after the meeting
for futher discussion can also be arranged.  Expected attendance as of today 
is as follows: 

Mainland: a group of ~12, lead by Prof Chen Jian-Sheng
US      : Burstein, Fang, Lu, Windhorst (?), and Hester (?) 
Taiwan  : NCU - 8 faculty members plus ~25 RA's and grad students 
          Academia Sinica - TBD
          NTHU - TBD 
          NCKU - TBD 
          Normal Univ - TBD 

Please provide us with suggestions and comments on the meeting agenda at 
your early convenience.  We have to form a preliminary agenda soon for the 
application of funding support. 

We will mail out forms to the Mainland passport holders in the coming week. 
Prompt reply will be appreciated since the entry processes usually take more
time then expected.  

Local fellow astronomers are all very welcome.  Please contact Wei-Hsin Sun
for further information.  

Best regards,   Wei-Hsin Sun
