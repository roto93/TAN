Dear TANists,

I am sorry that if you had difficulties in sending messages to TAN in 
the past week.  The host machine of TAN, biaa17, had experienced
two consecutive disk failures (one internal and one external:-) in the 
past 7 days.  Hope the machine will be stablized very soon.  Sorry again.

Subject: #1 Farewell Parties to Chi

We had two WONDERFUL farewell parties for Dr. Chi Yuan, the former 
director of ASIAA, on the 26th last month.

The more formal party was held at the Institute in the afternoon.
President Yuan Lee of Academia Sinica also attended this party.
Dr. Typhoon Lee presented a 'synthesized image' of Chi.  
For those curious minds, you can find it at ASIAA's web site very soon:-)
An oil painting of spiral galaxies was dedicated to Chi
to thank for Chi's great contribution to ASIAA.  The painting is now
hung on the wall in the conference room of ASIAA.

In the evening, a wilder party was held at a tea house on a hillside near
MaoKun.  On average, more than two bottles of Taiwan beers were consumed
per person that night.  Chi almost failed our drinking test as we had 
many more (wo)man power than ever before (even though Chi claimed his
drinking speed is 13.5 glasses/hr ~ 13.5 km/s of the pattern speed of
spiral arms:-).  The party lasted till midnight.

Subject: #2 Video Taped Colloquia from Berkeley, Illinois and Maryland

As mentioned in the last issue, astronomers in Taiwan often feel isolated
from outside world.  It was first suggested by Dr. Typhoon Lee; an effort 
to overcome such isolation has been made, through the support of Drs. Frank 
Shu at Berkeley, Fred Lo at Illinois and Stuart Vogel at Maryland.
Very soon we will be receiving video tapes of weekly colloquia given at
these three schools regularly.  A tentative plan is to show these tapes 
on every Saturday at ASIAA (however, this can be changed according to
you people's feedback). All astronomers in Taiwan are welcome. The 
exact titles of the talks will be announced in advance.

We should all appreciate the invaluable help provided from the 3 
BIMA fellows, Shang Hsien, Lai Shih-Ping and Lee Chin-Fei, at Berkeley, 
Illinois and Maryland, respectively.  Thank you all!

Subject: #3 Technology transfer
 
I came across an article on YSN regarding technology transfer and feel 
it might interest some of you (SMART and TOT people in particular:-).
Here is an excerpt from it.
 
Y-J
-----------
... technology transfer between universities and industry.
 
Astronomy had a need for large format detectors at both the visible and
infrared wavelengths.  The visible end developed largely (I think) because
of video cameras used for surveilance, making TV shows, and the home
video useages.  The IR end was really only for military uses and those
devices were not particularly suited for astronomy because the conditions
under which they would be operated was very different.  So, the astronomy
community took their requirements to various IR array manufacturers and
asked if they could meet them.  The result today is reasonably large format
IR array detectors.  Now, a collaborative project is underway between
industry and universities (with some government help) to develop even
bigger devices.  There are two such projects going on with the two main
IR array providers to Astronomy: Santa Barbara Research Center (a branch
of Hughes) and Rockwell.  A good chunk of the money was put up by research
grants since the applications of these devices would be more or less
limited to astronomy, though some of the things they learn would obviously
be applicable to their other projects.
 
That's at least one example of technology transfer.  Having not been
directly involved in any of it, I can only say that I *believe* the format
of these particular interactions has been that the scientists have provided
the specs and have provided some of the manpower to test the devices while
the industrial partner has provided all the actual manufacture and research
associated with it. ...

Martin V. Zombeck's "Handbook of Space Astronomy & Astrophysics" is
on-line. Published by Cambridge University Press, this handbook has 
become a significant reference for space astronomy and astrophysics
(selected by Heidi Hammel as one of the astronomy books she would
want with her, if stranded on a desert island - Sky & Tel September 1996) 
The complete 2nd edition is available at your electronic desktop.
 
Many chapters now have links to related WWW resources containing extensive
tabulations, images, interactive programs, etc.. Look for the link at the top of the table of
contents for the given chapter.
