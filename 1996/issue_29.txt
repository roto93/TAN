 Radio Emission from Galactic and Extragalactic Compact Sources

         P R E L I M I N A R Y   R E G I S T R A T I O N


This Colloquium will mark the 30th anniversary of the first successful
experiments in Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI).  This
technique has developed at a rapid pace, and produced spectacular
results in a variety of astronomical research areas by steadily
advancing towards higher resolution, sensitivity, and image quality.
Several regional arrays and the global VLBI array are routinely
available, and the first fully dedicated VLBI array, the Very Long
Baseline Array, is now operating with great success.  The first space
VLBI mission (VSOP) is underway and expected to begin scientific
operation in early 1997.  New VLBI antennas, advanced recording
systems, and new correlators are under construction around the world,
and new methods for data processing and analysis are being developed.

This meeting will bring together researchers primarily interested in
the astronomical use of VLBI.  The meeting will provide a forum for
the discussion of research results from VLBI, and for the formation of
new technical and scientific ideas that will shape future developments
in VLBI.  About two thirds of the meeting will be devoted to the
discussion of recent astronomical results, while about one third will
focus on software and hardware developments.  There will be invited
review papers, contributed papers, and posters.  Specialized sessions
may also be arranged, subject to demand (e.g., discussions of specific
software or hardware issues).

SPONSORS: The meeting is co-sponsored by Commissions 28 (Galaxies) and
40 (Radio Astronomy) of the International Astronomical Union, by
Commission J (Radio Astronomy) of the Union Radio-Scientifique
Internationale, by the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology
(NMIMT), and by Associated Universities, Inc.

VENUE: The National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) will host the
meeting, which will be held in Socorro, 21-26 April 1997, at NMIMT's
Macey Center.  The Macey Center is adjacent to the NRAO's Array
Operations Center (AOC).
