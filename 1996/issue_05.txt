Dear TANists,

Below I will forward an email exchange between me and Prof. Rue-Ron Hsu
(with his permission) in regard to the issue of Taiwan's investment on
science.  The discussion was motivated by a Special Talk on the 
AMS Project (Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer) given by Dr. Samuel C.C. Ting
last Friday.  AMS project is an international research project on antimatter
and dark matter which involves 8 countries (including Taiwan) and some
37 universities.

This is an intriguing topic for all of us to think about.

Cheers,
Yi-Jehng

Dear Dr. Kuan;

I do not against any international project in Taiwan.
I do know the importance of the big science, and I also do
understand that the international projects are very important
for Taiwan if we want to have good performance in the physics
community of the world.
However, un-limited expansion will make some trouble in the
future such as the economic policy of all in all
underdeveloped country.
According my understanding, I think that Taiwan have manpower
problem if Taiwan join CERN, Fermi Lab, KEK, SMART and AMS at
same time. I think that Taiwan shall give them some order.
Concentrate our manpower in some projects and do them well is
the most important thing.
Reserch funding is limited, we shall not jion those projects
in which we just contribute money without any feedback in
training our young scientist.

I am noboby, so my opinion is nothing. I believe that the
limited developement is importance, we shall not exhaust all
the resource of the next generation. Science environment is
similar to live environment, we shall think about it more
carefully.

Yeh, I spent too much time in this mail, I shall spend my
time in my research. See you.

Best regards;
Rue-Ron
