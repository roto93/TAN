The General Catalogue of Trigonometric Parallaxes, Fourth Edition, 1995.  
	W. F. van Altena, J. T. Lee and E. D. Hoffleit, 
		Yale University Observatory

Cost: $75.00 + $5.00 Domestic S&H or $7.85 Foreign S&H for the two-volume set.

	The Yale University Observatory announces the publication of a
completely revised and enlarged two-volume edition of the General Catalogue
of Trigonometric Stellar Parallaxes containing 15,994 parallaxes for 8,112
stars published before the end of 1995.  In this Fourth Edition, 1,722
(27%) new stars have been added to those contained in the previous edition
by Jenkins (1963).  The mode of the parallax accuracy for the newly added
stars (0.004" s.e.) is considerably better than in the previous editions
(about 0.016"). Approximately half of the newly added stars are fainter
than the Hipparcos Astrometric Satellite's magnitude limit of 13.0. 

	For each star we list a reference to the source of publication of
the individual parallax, the equatorial coordinates in the system of the
FK4 for 1900 and the secular variation for 100 years to aid in quickly
transferring from 1900 to 2000. Transit tables are provided to assist the
user in locating stars with coordinates at the equinox of 1950 or 2000. The
1900 equinox has been maintained to avoid assigning yet another star number
and avoid potential errors, since the 1900 based numbers have been used in
the Notes and elsewhere in the Catalogue. Auxilliary information is listed,
including UBV photometry, MK spectral types, cross identifications with
other catalogues, data on the variability and binary nature of the stars,
orbits when available, and miscellaneous information to aid in determining
the reliability of the data. 

	The relative parallaxes are corrected to absolute parallax using
newly computed corrections that are based on an improved model of the
Galaxy.  In the Introduction to the Catalogue, an analysis of the resulting
absolute parallaxes is summarized to determine the accidental and
systematic errors of the parallaxes. Those results provide a "system" for
the Catalogue which then yields weighted absolute parallaxes for each star.

	Printed copies of the Two-volume General Catalogue are available
from the Yale University Observatory, while the computer readable version
will be available soon from the Astronomical Data Center (ADC) at Goddard
Space Flight Center and from the Strasbourg Stellar Data Center (CDS) in
France. A CD ROM disk was issued by the ADC in 1991 which contained a
preliminary version of the YPC. In this final version we have revised the
weighting system, and included newly published parallaxes, photometry and
spectral types for most of the stars. The weighted mean parallaxes of many
stars will be found to differ from those in the preliminary version due to
changes in the weighting system and revisions to the default reference star
magnitudes.
