Business is surely slow in the summer. Most people must be on vacation:-)

Ok, here are my 2 cents regarding Taiwan's science investment.
As stated in Hsu's email:

Yes, I agree that any Taiwan's investment on science should include
training of new generation of scientists. I don't know about other 
big projects, however, I do know that Taiwan's students have been 
sent to graduate programs in astronomy at Berkeley, Illinois, and 
Maryland under SMART/BIMA projects.

  I don't understand your research objectives at all.
What's your conclusions any way ? The birthdays seem 
randomly distributed among the 12 months, which has
nothing to do with astrology.

  I am sorry to say that your manuscript cannot be
accepted for publication in the astrological journal.

Dear Editor,

For your respectable journal, I think 1 sigma confidence level
is good enough.
