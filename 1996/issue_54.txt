Dear Fellow Stargazers,

      Mars has day-night and seasons similar to the Earth.  In earler times, it 
also had rivers on the surface as well as an atmosphere resembling that of the 
young Earth.  No wonder human beings have been hoping to find life on this cold 
and dusty planet.  NASA recently announced the astonishing discovery of possible 
evidence for Martian life in a meteorite found in Antarctica.  How do we know 
that the meteorite originated from Mars?  How strong was the evidence for life?  
Are we no longer alone in the universe?  If you or your friends are interested 
in these questions please join me in a popular science talk (at Scientific 
American level) next Wednesday (Dec. 11) at 15:00 in the lecture hall on the 
first floor of the Institute of Physics, Academia Sinica.
      
      Sincerely yours,
      
      
      Typhoon Lee
      Acting director
