Subject: #1 A suggestion to TAN


That sounds like a good idea, but I would like the messages 
be organized and edited somewhat.  I much rather prefer to
get something like newsletter, once a week or something,
instead of getting e-mails from random people several times 
a day.  What do you think?

Dear You-Hua,

Yeah, that's really a good suggestion.  Then TAN will serve more like a
newsgroup instead of an email network.  It can also prevent the foreseeable
annoying junk mails (I suspect I myself have been contributing some kind of
'junks' these days:-).  That's also the reason why I have been very careful
in announcing the existence of TAN to only selected groups in order to
eliminate possible chaos.   At the moment, there are only 50 some
subscribers and the traffic is really slow (I guess partly because this is
a 'static' society in Taiwan and partly because it is the summer vacation
time:-).  My feeling is that it will not make too much difference in either
way at present but what you suggested is certainly the way to go when there
are more subscribers and more traffic (e.g., more than 2 emails per day 
on average).

However, then it would need an editor to moderate the traffic and it will
touch the sensitive issue of censorship unavoidably. Surely it would 
requires a little bit more effort than what is now:-).

Cheers,
Yi-Jehng

Subject: #3 Web sites and HST proposal


Yi-Jehng,

I tried TAN's web page.  The connection is extremely slow.  I got
connected, but couldn't get the archives.  I ran out of patience.

(Sorry, IAA's NFS server was not stable this early morning.  YJK)

By the way, my web page is  http://www.astro.uiuc.edu/~chu/.
Please check it out.  You can also find information on Magellanic 
Clouds and all back issues of the Magellanic Cloud Newsletter.

One thing good about TAN is that sometimes people in Taiwan may need 
some help in research.  If we know one another better, collaborations
can be established.  For example, I do not think anybody in Taiwan
has submitted HST proposals, but HST is open to astronomers
worldwide.  Why not take the advantage?  If anybody needs help,
I'll be happy to provide some assistance.

Back to work.

You-Hua

Subject: #4 HST Cycle 7 Call For Proposals Mailing
Reply-To: newprop@stsci.edu
 
 
Dear Colleague:
 
We have just mailed you the Hubble Space Telescope Cycle 7 Call for
Proposals, which invites and supports participation by the
international astronomical community in the HST General Observer and
Archival Research programs.  The proposal submission process and
requirements are almost identical to those for Cycle 6, and are
significantly simplified from early cycles.
 
This document merges what were in previous cycles a separate Call for
Proposals and Phase I Proposal Instructions.  The Instrument Handbooks
and Archive Manual are being mailed to institutions and libraries but
in an effort to reduce costs are not being sent automatically to individuals.
The Call for Proposals and technical documents will be available on-line on
the STScI Proposer Web page (http://www.stsci.edu/proposer), or can be
ordered using the STScI On-Line Documentation Web Page
(http://www.stsci.edu/proposer/documents.html) or by contacting the
STScI Help desk (help@stsci.edu, 1-800-544-8125 or 410-338-1082).
The Phase I templates can be retrieved by sending email after June 15, 1996
to newprop@stsci.edu, with subject line "request templates".
 
The second HST servicing mission (SM97) is currently scheduled for
February 13, 1997 and will involve several changes relevant for Cycle
7 proposers. Two new science instruments, the Space Telescope Imaging
Spectrograph (STIS), and Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object
Spectrometer (NICMOS), will replace the Goddard High Resolution
Spectrograph (GHRS) and the Faint Object Spectrograph (FOS),
respectively. These two new instruments promise new observational
capabilities in Cycle 7, and hence we encourage you to take advantage
of the new scientific opportunities and the continued exciting
possibilities of the WFPC2, FOC, and FGS instruments.
 
The deadline for electronically submitted proposals is Friday,
September 13, 1996 (earlier for paper-only submissions, which are
restricted in any case; see Call for Proposals for details).  Results
of the TAC evaluations will be sent out in December 1996, and we are
looking forward to a very scientifically productive program for this
cycle.
 
 
                                Sincerely,
 
 
                                Robert E. Williams

Subject: #5  Ph.D. programs in the US 


I was asked about the ranks of Ph.D. programs in the US. I think such
information might be helpful for some young TAN subscribers too. 

You can find the necessary information from the NRC (National 
Research Council; http://www.nas.edu/) Report 
(http://www.nas.edu/nap/online/researchdoc/, or, 
http://www.nas.edu/nap/online/researchdoc/researchdoc_tables.html)
which came out last October.  The NRC report rated 3,634 Ph.D.programs
in 41 fields at 274 institutions in the U.S..  For instance,
in physical sciences and mathematics, the Report contains 
fields in Astrophysics/Astronomy, Chemistry, Computer Science, Geosciences, 
Mathematics, Oceanography, Physics, and Statistics/Biostatistics.

Hope this would help.  Good luck.

Subject: #6  Welcome a new member

Now we add one more astronomer in Taiwan:-)

ASIAA has just got one new staff member Dr. Hwang, Chorng-Yuan.
Dr. Hwang got his BS and MS degree from National Taiwan Univ. and Ph.D. 
from UC-Berkeley.  He has been working with the EUV group at Berkeley.

Welcome on board!
