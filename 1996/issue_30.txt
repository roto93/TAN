                    Remainder of the Empire

There is a constitutional crisis in my alma mater in Hong Kong, Queen's
College, the oldest and arguably the most prestigious high school there
("college" is a fancy name for high school, which is really 5 years
of junior high and high school, plus 2 years of ordinary and advanced levels,
the last year being equivalent to college freshman year in America).

Well, the problem is in the name "Queen", because after 1 July 1997, there
will be no "Queen".  Last year, the Royal Jockey Club faced this difficult
problem and found a simple solution by deleting the word "Royal".  All the
horses and the gambling are the same this year under the new Jockey Club.
Unfortunately, this obvious solution does not work for my alma mater.  There
is no obvious word that is close to "Queen", while maintaining the
prestige and dignity of the "college".

While the school authorities and the loyal alumni (some distinguished ones
have even achieved knighthood under the crown) are engaged in finding a new
name for the school, rumor has reached me that the "default" option from
Beijing is to replace "Queen" by "Chairman Mao".

So, unless a truly imaginative solution is found between now and
July 1, I will become a former graduate of the Chairman Mao's College of
Hong Kong.  There must be a word that sounds like Queen, meaning something
dignified, and acceptable to Beijing.  What is that word ???

Found in 1754 "Columbia" used to be called King's College.  After the
Revolution (1776), this name was no longer appropriate.  It was eventually
changed to Columbia.

why not just "Leader's College" or even "State College" (short
for Head of State, of course!).

How about "National College" or "Hong Kong Most Excellent College" or
"Great-Wall-of-China College" or ...

I suppose "Imperial College" would not be acceptable to Beijing, despite a
lengthy imperial Chinese history? Not "politically correct" by Chinese
standards.
