Dear Fellow Stargazers:

      Dr. Ron Ekers, director of Australian Telescope National facility (ATNF),
member of Australian Academy of Sciences, and ex-director of (US)NRAO's VLA, 
is coming for a visit under the sponsorship of NSC's distinguished visitors
program at the invitation of ASIAA.  Ron is an internationally famous 
radio astronomer and the leader of Australia's radio astronomy.  He has worked
on diverse subjects from star formation to cosmic background including galactic
center and AGNs.  He is spearheading, in the astrophysics front, Australian's 
effort to nuture relations with Pacific rim countries: Taiwan, Japan, China, and
Korea.  His observatory in fact belongs to an industrial research organization:
CSIRO, thus traditionally very strong in interacting with engineering community.
Zhao Jun-Hui was his Ph.D. student.

Dr. Ekers' schedule is as follows:

10/20 evening to 10/23 morning, at ASIAA, giving one talk: 
      

1. 10/21 10:00: Cosmic Ray Induced Star Formation (biochem. bldg. room 428)

(***** followed by Frank Shu's talk at 11:00 on: Proto-stellar Cosmic 
           Ray and Extinct Radioactivities ******************)

10/23 afternoon visits Central Univ., astronomy, remote sensing, HEMT lab.
        giving one talk.

2. 10/23 15:30 : Radio Astronomy with ATNF (4th science bldg., room 914 )

10/24 morning visit Tsing-Hua Univ., afternoon Chiao-Tung Univ. giving one talk

3. 10/24 14:00 Chiao-Tung Univ.: Radio Astronomy as a Technology Driver
    (1st science bldg. room 321)    - the Australian Experience.

10/25  ASIAA, (perhaps Palace Museum), departure in the evening.

  
You are cordially invited to attend the talks.  If you are interested in meeting
Dr. Ekers in person, please contact Ms. Tseng Cheng at (02)652-2020x215

Sincerely,


Typhoon Lee, acting director, ASIAA

p.s. Frank Shu and Fred Lo will also be visiting ASIAA between 10/21 - 10/26
      by coincidence thus making it a week of astronomy heavy-weights.
