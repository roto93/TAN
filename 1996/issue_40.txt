Dear TANists,
 
By the time you see this mail, the 3rd GC meeting announcement probably 
is engraved on your heart already.  Here I apologize to you all for what
had happened this noon.  I was away at Normal teaching while it occured.
 
What had happened (the worst nightmare of mine:-) can be best described 
as a chain reaction or "TAN is playing ping pong with Central" 
(Chi's comment:-).  It should be preventable and TAN had been working as
expected UNTIL today.
 
I guess I had fixed the problem now (TAN still has problem dealing with
some machine's vacation program; but it's minor compared to what we had
today).  If there is no objection, I will give TAN another chance and 
leave it as is for now.  However, if such runaway situation does happen
again, I will then turn off TAN's active mailing function and begin to 
monitor/moderate the traffic (see Issue 16 for details).
 
Sorry again and hope it won't happen again.
 
Yi-Jehng
 
ps: By the way, please avoid sending the same message to TAN more than once.
pps: Has anyone read October issue of Physics Today? Check pages 61 to 63.
     TON (Taiwan Oscillation Network) was mentioned in the story (including
     a picture).
