APPLY FOR THE 1997 ASIAA-BIMA FELLOWSHIP NOW! 
A GREAT way to enter ASTRONOMY Ph. D. programs at Berkely, 
Illinois, or Maryland with FINANCIAL SUPPORT!

Academia Sinica's Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics 
(ASIAA) is looking for outstanding students to recommend to its 
three partner uniersities in the BIMA collaboration.  As a part of 
the agreement between ASIAA and BIMA to share the operating 
cost and the observation time of this world class mm-wave 
interferometer array telescope, BIMA every year offers financial 
assistance to support one graduate student from Taiwan to pursue  
graduate study leading to a Ph. D. degree in astronomy at 
U.California at Berkeley, U. Illinois at Champaign Urbana, or U. 
Maryland at College Park.  The past ASIAA-BIMA fellowship 
recipents for 1994, 1995, and 1996 were: Hsien Shang (Berkeley), 
Chin-Fei Lee (Maryland) and Shi-Ping Lai (Illinois), respectively.  
Applicants should apply to and satisfy the admission requirements of 
the three respective astronomy departments.  They should also 
send to ASIAA (Miss Ya-Ling Cheng, Box 1-87, Nankang, Taipei, 
Tel. 02-6522020x211) their curriculum vitae, transcripts, statement 
of research interest, and three recommendation letters before Dec. 
25, 1996.  We expect to interview the finalists in early January and 
notify the BIMA universities by January 15, 1997 in support of the 
application of the selected student.  Information brochures about 
ASIAA and its BIMA collaboration are available upon request. 
ASIAA's website address is: "biaa1.biaa.sinica.edu.tw".
