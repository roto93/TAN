             1996 Brouwer Award

	DDA BROUWER AWARD FOR 1996 GOES TO FRANK SHU

        Dr. Frank Shu of the University of California at Berkeley was
announced at the winner of the 1996 Dirk Brouwer Award of the Division
on Dynamical Astronomy for superb scholarship and powerful insight in
his contributions to galactic and stellar dynamics, star formation,
and the dynamics of planetary rings.  Shu has authored books on
astronomy and astrophysics.  His public service contributions include
committee work for the National Academy of Sciences and the American
Astronomical Society.  Professional offices include President of the
American Astronomical Society (1994-1996).

	On the dynamical structure of disk galaxies, Shu (with the
early collaboration of C. C. Lin) developed the density wave theory
for spiral galaxies.  He showed that gas flow in disk galaxies is
unstable against Parker's instability in the presence of an
interstellar magnetic field.

Shu has studied mass exchange in interacting binaries.  He has also
investigated the existence and growth of gravitational instabilities
in nearly Keplerian disks and postulated that they lead to binary
formation.

	Shu is the theoretical driving force in the theory of star
formation.  He has studied the formation of protostellar disks from
the gravitational collapse of cores of slowly rotating isothermal gas
clouds, photoevaporation of protostellar disks around massive stars,
and the outflow from rapidly rotating magnetic protostars. His
investigations of gravitational collapse of stellar systems have
implications for both stellar clusters and galaxies.

	The wealth of ring data from the Voyager spacecraft motivated
studies of wave propagation in planetary rings by Shu and others. This
includes bending waves in Saturn's rings, a nonlinear spiral density
wave theory, and viscous damping.

	Books written by Shu include "The physical universe: an
introduction to astronomy", "The Physics of Astrophysics, I:
Radiation" and "The Physics of Astrophysics, II: Gas Dynamics."

	In the area of public service Shu has served on numerous
committees of the American Astronomical Society and National Academy
of Sciences.  He was chair of the Astronomy Department at Berkeley
(1984-1988).  From 1994-1996 he was President of the American
Astronomical Society.
