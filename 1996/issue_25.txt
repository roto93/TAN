Dear fellow astronomers in Taiwan,

In the last IAU Regional Meeting held in Pusan, Korea, there was a small
session for the 'Radio Frequency Allocation in Asian-Pacific Region'.
In this meeting, we discussed about how to keep the sky radio-quiet
so that radio astronomers can keep working in the future.
I think this issue is of interest not only for radio astronomers
but also astronomers in other fields, so I will make a brief summary
of the meeting.

* Radio Frequency Allocation
   - Why:      for safety, for better propagation,
               to prevent crowding, and to prevent interference.
   - Problems: national sovereignty - radio signal does not stop at the border.
               economic value - industry people want it to make money.
   - Users:    AM, FM, TV (VHF, UHF, satellite, ...), cellular phone, pager,
               radar, satellite navigation system, etc.
               adn radio astronomers (they only listen).

* Problems to Radio Astronomy
   Serious problems to radio astronomy seems to come from global broadcasting
   systems such as navigation systems. For example:
   - For long wavelength astronomy, there is a Soviet satellite
     broadcasting signals at around 1600 MHz, which is very close to OH band.
     After this satellite started operation, OH observations became very
     difficult.
   - In the near future, Motorolar plans to launch 66 satellites
     broadcasting at around 1630 MHz. It will be very difficult to avoid
     66 satellites buzzing around the sky!
   - Short wavelength astronomy is not safe either, there are plans
     of satellites using frequency of about 100 GHz.

* Management Organizations
   - International level: ITU (International Telecommunication Union)
   - Regional level: CEPT, etc.
   - Frequency allocation table is managed in 3 regions over the world:
        N-S America, Europe-Africa, and Asia-Pacific.
   - In the global level, Radio astronomer's interest may be represented
     by IUCAF (Inter-Union Committee on Allocation of Frequency).
     In the regional level, N-S America and Europe-Africa regions have
     their own organizations working to protect frequency bands important
     to radio astronomy, but we, Asia-Pacific region, do not.
   - So we would like to know if astronomers in this region want to make one.
     For now, let's call this as PACRAF (Pacific-Asia Committee on Radio
     Astronomy Frequency).
     Questions we want to ask astronomers:
        + Is this a good idea?
        + How to make it?
        + When/how to meet?
        + How to give input to national governments?
        + Should we ask support from bigger organizations such as APEC?

* What can we do in the meanwhile?
   - Tell other astronomers about the importance of protecting radio frequency.
   - Tell scientists in other fields. They are relatively easier to persuade.
   - Tell other people (including people in commercial industry)
     that we are doing something important though we don't make money
     out of radio frequency spectrum.

* If you have suggestions/comments/questions/ideas, send it to
     Dr. R. Marcus Price at CSIRO, ATNF, Parkes Observatory, Australia:
                            rmprice@atnf.csiro.au
  He have a mailing list of people concerned about this issue.

Best wishes.
