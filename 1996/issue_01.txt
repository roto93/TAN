Dear Astronomers and Astrophysicists,
 
 
I am setting up an email network of all professional astronomers/
astrophysicists in Taiwan.  The aim of this network is to increase 
the communication among us (not too many tho:-) in an informal way.
Your messages will be distributed to all subscribers AUTOMATICALLY.
This acts just like a real-time open forum.


As mentioned, this is not an official network, so feel free to bring 
up anything you think is relevant to astronomy in Taiwan.  An example
of the usuage of this mail service is information exchange, such as 
the announcement of a scheduled talk.
 
 
If you are interested in subscribing it, please email
 
        kuan@sinica.edu.tw
 
for details.  Please give a short description of your professional
background.  Graduate students in astronomy/astrophysics/physics
programs are also welcome.

 
Comment?  Suggestion?  Hope I can hear from you very soon.
 
Please GIVE IT A TRY!
 
 
Sincerely Yours,
Yi-Jehng Kuan
