Dear Colleague,

As one of the activities of "World Year of Physics 2005" in Taiwan, the 
world-famous scientist, Professor John D. Barrow from University of 
Cambridge and Gresham College (United Kingdom), will give two lectures at 
National Taiwan University on September 5th (Monday) and September 6th 
(Tuesday).  In addition to serving in Department of Applied Mathematics 
and Theoretical Physics at University of Cambridge, Prof. Barrow is 
currently serving as Gresham Professor of Astronomy at Gresham College in 
London.  You are welcome to participate these exciting events.

Dear all,

Next Thursday (Sep. 8), Dr. Josh Eisner from UC Berkeley will give a 
colloquium
talk entitled "Probing Sub-AU Radii of Protoplanetary Disks: 
Observations with
the Keck and Palomar Testbed Interferometers".

Please notice the special time of the talk. Mark your calendar and 
remember to join!

Regards,
Naomi


TIARA-ASIAA Colloquium
=============================================

Date & Time: Sep. 8 (Thu.) 2:00 P.M.
Place: ASIAA conference room, R716

Title: Probing Sub-AU Radii of Protoplanetary Disks:
Observations with the Keck and Palomar Testbed Interferometers

Speaker: Josh Eisner (UC Berkeley)

Abstract:
The structure of young circumstellar disks, and in particular of
regions within 1 AU of the central star,
has important implications for disk accretion and planet formation.
We have observed a sample of T Tauri and Herbig Ae/Be stars with the
Keck and Palomar Testbed Interferometers, and we supplement these
interferometric data with echelle spectroscopy and optical through 
near-IR photometry.  With these data, we constrain the geometries and
temperatures of inner circumstellar dust disks, and compare
our measurements with the predictions of physical disk models.
Analyzing our measured inner disk properties with those expected for
magnetospheric accretion models, we find evidence that gaseous disk
material extends further in toward the star than dust.
We discuss implications for terrestrial planet formation and the
migration of giant planets.
