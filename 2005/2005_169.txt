Abstract
========
 In the earliest stages of stellar evolution a newly formed massive 
star, surrounded by a dense gas envelope, is deeply embedded in its natal 
molecular cloud. Outflows and high energy photons from the newly formed 
young stellar object(YSO) can strongly affect both the physical and 
chemical structure of the surrounding gas cloud. Observational studies of 
massive YSO environments reveal rich molecular spectra with a large variety 
of species.  Chemistry may be a unique diagnostic of the relative 
importance of different physical processes that occur within the YSO 
envelope, and a good understanding of chemistry is therefore crucial to 
comprehend the birth and evolution of massive stars.
