Dear Colleagues,
  Registration for the Subaru East Asia Youth Seminar is now open.  We
anticipate that 10 people from Taiwan will be selected to attend this seminar,
with priority given to postdocs, and then graduate students, who are most
likely to use SUBARU in the immediate future.  At the present time, SUBARU
will be able to provide airfares for two people and local support for all
attendees (up to 10 people).  Please register if you are interested in attending.

sincerely,
Jeremy Lim
