Subject: SMA Call for Proposals (fwd)

Dear Yi-Jehng,

The email on the SMA proposal, which I just forwarded,
had the deadliine in the USA time. The deadline is
Sep 14, 2005 in Taiwan time. The following is the updated
call for proposal. Please put the following information at TAN
instead of the previous email.

Thanks,

Dear Colleagues,

Proposals for Submillimeter Array (SMA) observations for the semester
November 2005 through April 2006 are due on Wednesday, September 14, 2005
in Taiwan time (Tuesday, September 13, 2005 in the US).
The SMA is the first facility for subarcsecond imaging observations at
submillimeter wavelengths, operating in partly transparent atmospheric
windows from 1.4 to 0.4 millimeters, as a collaborative project between
the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO) and the Academia
Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA).

As some of you know, the time allocation process for the SMA observations is 
under change. We are trying to have one unified
Time Allocation Committee (TAC) with the SAO side, but we are not
still sure whether we can start it from this cycle or next.
Meantime, please refer the following web page:

   http://sma1.sma.hawaii.edu/

for instructions and tools for proposal preparation, and
for detailed information about SMA capabilities.
As soon as we have updated information on the proposal submission
procedure and the time allocation process, we will let you know.

The SMA is a powerful but complex instrument; prospective first time
users are encouraged to consult an experienced SMA staff member
for advice in advance of the deadline via smaprop@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw.

Nagayoshi Ohashi
