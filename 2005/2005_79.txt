> The final deadline for registration and abstract submission for this Symposium
> is June 30.  Thank you to all those who have registered - we have an excellent

>
> The LOC takes this chance to highlight a few issues:
>
> 1. You can submit an abstract or modify your registration information froma
>    'View Participants' on the Symposium homepage. Simply click on your namea
>    and for the sake of security, you will be required to enter the same emaila
>    address provided on your registration. We have improved the registrationa
>    webpage so that two abstracts (one poster, one oral) can be submitteda
>    through the symposium webpage.  You can also take this chance to modify
>    your registration information, for example, arrival and departure details
>    which will be helpful for the LOC. Thank you.
>
> 2. Prof Dick Manchester has kindly accepted an invitation from the LOC to
>    present a one-day Pulsar Workshop on August 1st. The purpose of this is to
>    give a brief introduction about pulsars to students and those who have just
>    entered this subject.
>            Venue: Urumqi Observatory
>            When:  10:30am-1:00pm
>                    3:30pm-6:30pm
>
> 3. The LOC has provided new maps for Urumqi and Xinjiang, please click on
>    "Useful Information" on our symposium webpage and download the maps. For
>    the non-Chinese speakers, we also put an English-Chinese translation in
>    this area, which includes several frequently used sentences. We hope this
>    will be useful for you.
>
> 4. The climate in different areas of Xinjiang is variable over a wide range.
>    The weather in Urumqi in August is pleasant most of the time, but in Turfan
>    it could go up to more than 45C although you may not feel so bad due to the
>    dry climate. Lake Hanas is situated in the cool temperature zone. In August
>    the mean temperature is around 16C, with relative humidity of 63%.
>    Night-time temperatures could be approximately as low as 0C occasionally.
>    The LOC suggests you bring enough suitable clothes with you.
>
> 5. Please don't arrive later than August 2nd as we depart for Hanas early on
>    the morning of August 3rd. We come back to Urumqi on the evening of August
>    8th. On August 9, there is an optional visit to Nanshan Observatory, about
>    1.5 hour's drive from Urumqi.
>
> 6. The scientific program will be available in early July after the abstract
>    deadline.
>
> 7. We will provide both multimedia projector and transparency projector for
>    the oral presentations. Use of Powerpoint files is encouraged.

>    Service (CITS XINJIANG, see  http://www.xinjiangtour.com/). We recommend
>    you contact CITS if you want to organise private travel outside the
>    symposium although the LOC will always be ready to provide help and advice
>    if necessary. The contact details for CITS are:
