Dear Astronomers in Taiwan,
 

You probably have known that the 2005 Annual Meeting of the Chinese
Astronomical Society (CAST 2005) will be held in National Central University
on 3-4 June 2005.  We would like to show our sincere appreciation for your
participations. There are about 100 participators have been registered on
line and more 40 contributed talks, as well as ~50 posters, from various
areas will be presented during the meeting.  The program of the meeting is
ready, please check  <http://www.cast.org.tw/cas94/>
http://www.cast.org.tw/cas94/ for details.  For the ones miss the change to
register on line but still are interested in the program, you may as well do
it directly during the meeting.

On the other hand, in addition to the talk for the CAST2005, one of our
invited speakers, Prof. Alex Filippenko, will give a talk entitled " Dark
Energy and the Runaway Universe" for the general public on June 2 (Thu)
19:00 at Room 209 Science Building IV, National Central University.  Prof.
Filippenko played as a important role in the breakthrough of the cosmology
in 1998.  It is a great chance to know about the modern cosmology, such as
"dark energy", "cosmic antigravity" etc.  For more information, please check
