Subject: [Colloquium] Special ASIAA Colloquium (08/15 Monday)

  Dear all,

        Dr. Michael Liu from Institute for Astronomy at U. of Hawaii will
  be visiting early next week. Dr. Liu has been working on a variety of
  astrophysical topics from observational perspectives, such as galaxy
  evolution, star and planet formation, brown dwarfs, etc. On Monday, he
  will present a colloquium talk related to his recent work, titled
  "Young Circumstellar Disks: Substellar and Debris".

        Please notice the special time of the talk. Mark your calendar
  and remember to join!

  Regards,

  sheng-yuan

   Speaker : Dr. Dr. Michael Liu (Institute for Astronomy, U. of Hawaii)
   Title   : Young Circumstellar Disks: Substellar and Debris
   Time    : 08/15 (Mon) 2:00 PM
   Location: ASIAA Room 716
   Abstract: We discuss two emerging areas which are furthering our
             understanding of disk evolution and its connection to the
             plausible diversity of planetary systems. (1) Disks around
             young brown dwarfs are now known to be as common as disks
             around young stars. We discuss the characteristics of these
             "circum-substellar" disks, including their potential for
             planet formation, and implications for the origins of brown
             dwarfs. (2) The transition from primordial disks to debris
             disks is intimately associated with the formation of
             planetesimals and planets. We present results from sub-mm
             and IR studies during the crucial 10-100 Myr epoch. We
             highlight the newly discovered disk around the nearby M star
             AU Mic, the first large scattered-light disk discovered in
             20 years and the first debris disk found around a low-mass star.
             We discuss connections between AU Mic and other known young
             debris disk systems, including the long-studied archetype
             beta Pictoris. These two systems likely represent a key phase
             in disk evolution, between the primordial disks around
             pre-main sequence stars and the very tenuous debris disks
             around old field stars.
