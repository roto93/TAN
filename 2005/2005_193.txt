Dear Prof. Chi Yuan

Thanking you for your kind assistance during staying Taiwan.

I was requested by Prof. Hanawa (Chiba Univ.) about 
informing you of ``Winter School.'' This is the school 
intended for the student and Postdoc. In this school, 
it is focused especially on numerical MHD simulations 
methods. Could you inform your students of this school?
When your students attend this school, the travel and 
living expenses are supported.

Sincerely,

Masahiro Machida

Sokendai Asia Winter School 2005

Dear Colleagues,

This is a notice of a winter school on numerical astrophysics, which is held 
in March, 2006.  It is focused especially on numerical MHD simulations and 
covers subjects from physical characteristics of MHD equations to numerical 
calculations and their visualizations.  This is a joint program of School 
of Physical Sciences, Graduate University of Advanced Studies (SOKENDAI), 
National Astronomical Observatory of Japan, and School of Science and Technology,
Chiba University.  

DATE: March 13 (Monday) - 17 (Friday), 2006
PLACE: Chiba University (Lecture begins 11AM of March 13.)
 
Lectures will be given on (a) hydrodynamics, (b) finite-difference 
scheme, and (c) upwind schemes all of which cover magnetohydrodynamics.  
These are coupled with laboratory works in which students will be asked 
to write a code and analyze or visualize numerical data.  Lecturers/instructors
will be Tomoyuki Hanawa (Chiba U.), Ryoji Matsumoto (Chiba U.), 
Kazunari Shibata (Kyoto U.), Takaaki Yokoyama (U. Tokyo), D.-S. Ryu 
(Chungnam Nat. U.), and Kohji Tomisaka (NAOJ).  Beside the above fundamental 
lectures, there are topical lectures on the present status of the numerical 
astrophysics and numerical computational methods.  

Prerequisite for students is a basic knowledge of fluid dynamics.  
Knowledges of basic unix commands is preferable and students should be familiar
with at least one of the computer languages, fortran or c.  

If you are interested in attending the winter school, send 
(1) an application form attached to this notice 
and (if you are a graduate student or postdoc) 
(2) a recommendation letter from your adviser. 
These must be reached no later than January 10, 2006 by
astro_school@th.nao.ac.jp. 

We encourage attendance from outside of Japan.  A number of such students 
can be supported for travel and living expenses in Japan.  However,
due to the condition of our budget, I would like to remind you this must be 
limited.

We are going to book hotel rooms for attendants from abroad. 
The rate will be 6000 yen / night for a single room.
 
Please check whether you need a visa to enter Japan or not.
Ask your nearest Japanese diplomatic mission.  Homepage of Ministry of Foreign
Affairs of Japan is found from http://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/index.html.
