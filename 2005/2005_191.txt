  Dear all,

        This Friday we will have a colloquium talk presented by Dr.
  Jennifer Karr. Dr. Karr joined IAA just two months ago. She has been
  involved in various projects with the Spitzer Space Telescope. On
  Friday, she will discuss the SED of young stellar objects viewed by
  Spitzer.

        Please mark your calendar and remember to join!

  Regards,
  sheng-yuan

   Speaker : Dr. Jennifer Karr (ASIAA)
   Title   : Interpreting Spitzer Colours of Young Stellar Objects
   Time    : 12/23 (Fri) 2:00 PM
   Location: ASIAA Room 716
   Abstract:
             The Spitzer Space telescope is providing an unprecedented
             opportunity for the study of young stars. I will discussing
             the observational properties of YSOs at Spitzer wavelengths,
             and the interpretation of their colours and SEDs. In particular,
             archived data from the Infrared Space Observatory has been
             used to provide a comparison sample of colours and SEDs of
             YSOs of known type. These data are then compared with the
             properties of catalogues derived from the Spitzer Galactic
             First Look Survey.
