Title: The nature of (25143) Itokawa, a target asteroid of "HAYABUSA"
       sample-return mission

Abstract:

Near-erath asteroid (25143) Itokawa is a target body of Japanese sample 
return HAYABUSA mission. HAYABUSA was successfully launched by Japanese 
M-V-5 rocket on May 19, 2003. This asteroid was discovered on September 26, 
1998 by the Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research program as 1998 SF36, and 
closed approach to the earth in 2001 and 2004. The observing campaign for 
this asteroid was performed during this period. The kinds of observations 
were visible to near infrared spectroscopy, visible to thermal infrared 
colorimetry, light variation, and radar observation. The obtained 
information about the physical property of this asteroid is taxonomic type, 
size, shape, pole orientation, rotational period, optical and radar albedo, 
and so on. We can also estimate bulk mass and density, surface density and 
porosity, surface temperature and thermal inertia, surface gravity and so 
on. Here we review the physical property of asteroid Itokawa obtained by 
ground-based observation and estimate the nature of Itokawa. We also 
mention how these results feedback to the mission scenario.

I will also talk on HAYABUSA mission status and planning of the next 
generation sample-return mission, time permitting.
