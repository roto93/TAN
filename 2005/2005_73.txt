THE SUBMILLIMETER ARRAY: STUDYING THE PAST, PIONEERING THE FUTURE

Cambridge, MA- Astronomers are meeting this week in Cambridge, Mass., to
discuss recent advances generated by a new astronomical facility-the
Submillimeter Array (SMA) on Mauna Kea, Hawaii. A joint project of the
Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO) and the Academia Sinica
Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA), the SMA has opened a new
window onto the cosmos by observing radiation from some of the coldest,
dustiest, and most distant objects in the universe.

"The SMA is the latest in a long line of cutting-edge research facilities
developed by the Smithsonian," said Jim Moran, SMA director. "It
demonstrates the Smithsonian's commitment to remaining at the frontier of
scientific research."

This meeting is open to media representatives, who may attend for free. To
register and receive press credentials, contact one of the public
information officers listed above.

Atop the highest volcanic peak in the Hawaiian Island chain, the SMA
explores the universe by detecting light at wavelengths (or colors) that
are not visible to the human eye. It receives millimeter and submillimeter
radiation, so named because the wavelength ranges from 0.3 to 1.7
millimeters, or 0.01 to 0.07 inches. The SMA combines signals from eight
6-meter-diameter movable antennas to achieve very high resolution,
comparable to the best ground-based optical telescopes.

At submillimeter wavelengths, the SMA can peer into the most distant
reaches of the observable universe, studying objects whose light has taken
billions of years to reach the earth. In doing so, it sees those objects
as they existed billions of years ago, when the universe was a fraction of
its present age.

SMA observations have uncovered some surprises. For example, astronomers
recently focused on a class of objects called submillimeter galaxies,
which were discovered using the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope, also on
Mauna Kea. Hubble images were unable to discern the nature of these
primordial galaxies because they were too distant or too dusty.

The SMA has clarified the nature of these mystery objects, revealing that
many submillimeter galaxies are undergoing intense bursts of star
formation hidden behind massive amounts of dust.

"The SMA literally has seen what Hubble can't see," said astronomer
Daisuke Iono of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA).
"The unique capabilities of the SMA allow it to detect and make
high-resolution images of these young galaxies."

"With the SMA, we immediately pinpointed the exact location of two
galaxies that were actively forming stars at an exceptional rate more than
10 billion years ago," added astronomer Alison Peck (CfA).

SMA observations are expected to help clarify the nature of many cosmic
objects from distant galaxies to nearby star forming regions. It will
examine those objects at high angular resolution in preparation for more
detailed and more sensitive studies by its eventual successor, the Atacama
Large Millimeter Array (ALMA).

"SMA is blazing a path of discovery across northern skies that ALMA will
follow as it brings a depth of understanding to planet, star and galaxy
formation in the southern skies," said Al Wootten, ALMA project scientist.

Headquartered in Cambridge, Mass., the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for
Astrophysics (CfA) is a joint collaboration between the Smithsonian
Astrophysical Observatory and the Harvard College Observatory. CfA
scientists, organized into six research divisions, study the origin,
evolution and ultimate fate of the universe.

SMA CONFIRMS PROTOPLANETARY SYSTEMS ARE COMMON IN THE GALAXY

Cambridge, MA - Meeting this week in Cambridge, Mass., astronomers using
the Submillimeter Array (SMA) on Mauna Kea, Hawaii, confirmed, for the
first time, that many of the objects termed "proplyds" found in the Orion
Nebula do have sufficient material to form new planetary systems like our
own.

"The SMA is the only telescope that can measure the dust within the Orion
proplyds, and thereby assess their true potential for forming planets. This
is critical in our understanding of how solar systems form in hostile
regions of space," said Jonathan Williams of the University of Hawaii
Institute for Astronomy, lead author on a paper submitted to The
Astrophysical Journal.

Surviving in the chaotic regions within the Orion Nebula where stellar
winds can reach a staggering two million miles per hour and temperatures
exceed a searing 18,000 degrees Fahrenheit, the question remained - would
enough material endure to form a new solar system or would it be eroded
away into space like wind and sand eroding away desert cliffs? It now
appears that these protoplanetary disks are quite tenacious, bringing new
grounds for optimism in the search for planetary systems.

Imaged by the Hubble Space Telescope back in the early 1990s as misshapen
silhouettes against the nebular background, the most spectacular proplyds
appear bright. Their surrounding ionized cocoons glow due to their close
proximity to a nearby hot star formation called the Trapezium. The
Trapezium is a star cluster consisting of more than 1,000 young, hot stars
that are only 1 million years old. They condensed out of the original
cold, dark cloud of gas that now glows from their ionizing light. They are
crowded into a space about 4 light-years in diameter, the same as the
distance between the Sun and Proxima Centauri, the next closest star in
space.

Blasted by the solar winds of the Trapezium, the proplyds are the next
generation of smaller stars to arise in Orion, this time with visible discs
that may be forming planets. It has remained unclear, however, whether they
contained enough material to form stable planetary systems. Using the SMA,
astronomers now have been able to probe deep inside these disks to measure
their mass and to unravel the formation process presented by these
potential infant solar systems.

"While the Hubble pictures were spectacular, they revealed only disk-like
shapes that did not tell us the amount of material present," said David
Wilner, of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA).  Since
some of the discs appear to be comparable in size and mass to our own solar
system, this strengthens the connection between the Orion proplyds and our
origins.

Since most Sun-like stars in the Galaxy eventually form in environments
like the Orion Nebula, the SMA results suggest that the formation of solar
systems like our own is common and a continuing event in the Galaxy.

"The same cycle of birth, life and death we experience here on Earth is
repeated in the stars overhead. Now, the SMA provides us with a front-row
seat in unraveling the wonder of these cosmic events," reflected Wilner.

Astrophysics (CfA) is a joint collaboration between the Smithsonian
Astrophysical Observatory and the Harvard College Observatory. CfA

evolution and ultimate fate of the universe.
