TITLE:  In Search for Cosmic Dust 

SPEAKER: Prof. Sun Kwok (ASIAA)

Abstract
========
It has been 70 years since the discovery of dust in space.  With modern
observations from submm to x-ray, we can now detect dust from absorption,
scattering, emission, self absorption and polarization.  But how well do
we know the spatial distribution of dust?  This will be discussed with
some examples from new observations from space and on the ground.  In
particular, we will show some new, preliminary results from the Spitzer
galactic plane survey.
