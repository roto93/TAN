*********** FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT OF KAW4 ***********************************
Title: KASI-APCTP Joint Workshop:
       Origin, Propagation and Interaction of Energetic Particles
       (4th Korean Astrophysics Workshop)
When:  May 17-19 (Wednesday-Friday), 2006
Where: KASI (Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute)
       Daejeon, Korea
Homepage: http://sirius.cnu.ac.kr/kaw4/

Scientific Rationale:
   Among the Asian countries including China, India, Japan, Korea,
   Taiwan, there are growing common interests in the budding field of
   "cosmic particle physics", such as on the following subjects
   - Ultrahigh energy cosmic rays
   - Astrophysical sources of cosmic rays
   - Propagation of cosmic rays and high energy interactions
   - Observation of cosmic rays

   This workshop subsumes many of these questions under the heading
   "Origin, propagation and interaction of energetic particles".

   Researchers from the Asian countries as well as USA and Europe
   will discuss
   - how to learn more physics and take more initiatives in this field
     of modern physics, cosmic particle physics
   - how to improve the interactions between all of us.

Organizing Committee:
   Biermann, Peter L.(Max-Planck-Institute fur Radioastronomie, Germany)
   Gopal-Krishna (National Centre for Radio Astrophysics, India)
   Kang, Hyesung (Pusan National University, Korea)
   Kim, Jongsoo (Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute)
   Li, Ti-Pei (Tsinghua University, China)
   Protheroe, Raymond J. (University of Adelaide, Australia)
