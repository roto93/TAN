Atomic, Molecular, and Solid-State Radiation Processes in the 
Interstellar Medium

The recent development of observing capabilities in the x-ray, UV, 
infrared, and submillimeter parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, 
especially through observations from space, has identified many radiation 
processes not possible in the terrestrial environment.  The low density of 
interstellar space has allowed the emission of photons from metastable 
states of atoms and ions, as well as from unstable molecular species such 
as radicals.  There are also a number of unidentified features that may 
have their origin in nanoparticles.

In this talk, we will present an overview of modern astronomical 
observations from the radio to the x-ray, and discuss the implication 
these observations on physics and chemistry.
