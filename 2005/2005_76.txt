SMA STARES INTO THE THROAT OF A COSMIC JET

Cambridge, MA - Astronomers find jets everywhere when they look into space.
Small jets spout from newborn stars, while huge jets blast out of the
centers of galaxies. Yet despite their commonness, the processes that drive
them remain shrouded in mystery. Even relatively nearby stellar jets hide
their origins behind almost impenetrable clouds of dust. All stars,
including our sun, pass through a jet phase during their "childhood," so
astronomers are eager to understand how jets form and how they may
influence star and planet formation.

At this week's meeting on submillimeter astronomy in Cambridge, Mass.,
astronomers described the latest results from an international
collaboration using the Submillimeter Array (SMA) atop Mauna Kea, Hawaii.
The SMA has begun to peer through the dust and home in on the sources of
nearby stellar jets.

"Using the SMA, we can stare into the throat of the jet," said SMA project
scientist Paul Ho of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA).
"We're getting close to seeing its launching point."

Astronomer Hsien Shang of the Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and
Astrophysics (ASIAA) and her colleagues have created a model of jet
formation that calculates temperatures, densities and brightnesses within
stellar jets. SMA observations of a young star system prosaically named
Herbig-Haro (HH) 211 have confirmed the validity of the model.

"Our model predicts what we will see about 100 astronomical units from the
star," Shang said. (One astronomical unit is the average Earth-Sun distance
of 93 million miles.) "With the SMA, we can begin to look at the HH 211
system at the scale of the model and test those predictions. So far,
everything checks out."

HH 211 is located about 1,000 light-years away in the constellation
Perseus.  Astronomers estimate that the small protostar hidden within HH
211 is less than 1,000 years old-a mere baby by astronomical standards, so
young that it is still growing by accumulating matter from a surrounding
disk of gas and dust. The protostar eventually will become a low-mass star
similar to the sun.

Although most of the matter in the disk will flow onto the star, some must
be ejected outward to carry away excess angular momentum. Complex physical
processes funnel that ejected matter into dual jets that shoot outward in
opposite directions.

"Jets form very close to a protostar, within about 5 million miles of its
surface according to the model we applied" said researcher Naomi Hirano
(ASIAA). "The SMA can help test the jet model on the youngest protostars
using molecular tracers from within that innermost region."

SMA's successor, the planned ALMA project, should finally reveal the nature
of the engine powering these jets by peering into the core where they form.

"The SMA has brought us tantalizingly close to our goal-the answer to the
question of how jets form," said Ho. "ALMA will take us those final few
steps."

Headquartered in Cambridge, Mass., the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for
Astrophysics (CfA) is a joint collaboration between the Smithsonian
Astrophysical Observatory and the Harvard College Observatory. CfA
scientists, organized into six research divisions, study the origin,
evolution and ultimate fate of the universe.

OBSERVING THE SOLAR SYSTEM IN SUBMILLIMETER WAVELENGTHS

-- Getting Ready to Fingerprint a Comet --

The Submillimeter Array (SMA) will be ready and watching when NASA's Deep
Impact probe strikes the nucleus of Comet Tempel 1 on July 4th. The impact
is expected to excavate material from the comet's interior-material left
over from the earliest days of our solar system.

"The SMA will be the only operational millimeter or submillimeter array
observing Tempel 1 at the time of the impact" said astronomer Charlie Qi
of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA). "As such,
there's no telling what we may see!"

A few observatories can study comets in the same wavelength regime as the
SMA, but none match SMA's exquisite resolution.  "The SMA will be the only
submillimeter telescope in the world to make an image of the molecules
released by the impact," said astronomer Glen Petitpas (CfA).

By observing submillimeter radiation, the SMA can "fingerprint" comets and
determine their molecular composition. "SMA will observe mostly cool gas
and dust with relative chemical abundances that may or may not be typical
of other comets. We hope to see something NOT typical, because that would
be most exciting to us scientifically," said Qi.

In the 1950s, the late Dr. Fred Whipple (CfA) developed the famous "dirty
snowball" model for comets. Whipple hypothesized that comets consisted of
ice with some dirt and rock mixed in. Modern astronomers believe that
comets are better described as "icy dirtballs," containing more dirt and
less ice than previously thought.

Deep Impact's mission is to test these new models by excavating a crater
more than 80 feet deep and 300 feet in diameter, revealing the comet's
pristine interior. Scientists will compare the freshly excavated material
to the more easily visible cometary surface.

Ernst Tempel discovered Comet Tempel 1 in 1867. The comet has made many
passages through the inner solar system orbiting the Sun every 5.5 years.
This makes Tempel 1 a good target to study evolutionary change in the
mantle, or upper crust, of the comet.

While the impending SMA observations of Deep Impact were a hot topic of
discussion at this week's meeting on submillimeter astronomy held in
Cambridge, Mass., Comet Tempel 1 is only one of the solar system objects
that the SMA has studied.

-- Monitoring the Weather on Mars --

The planet Mars also has been a target of particular interest. As rovers
and orbiters study the Red Planet close-up, the SMA takes in the big
picture from a distance.

"Our research is very complementary to the spacecraft exploring Mars,"
said astronomer Mark Gurwell (CfA). "We get a large-scale picture in a
different way from the Mars Global Surveyor, for example."

While missions to Mars have focused mainly on the planet's surface, the
SMA is sensitive to conditions within the planet's atmosphere. As such, it
serves as an Earth-based weather station, able to monitor atmospheric
conditions on Mars from millions of miles away.

"The SMA enables us to study abundances of molecules and thus atmospheric
chemistry. We can study atmospheric dynamics of an entire hemisphere at a
time," said Gurwell. "Our measurements give us a 3-d map of atmospheric
temperatures to greater heights than any Mars-orbiting spacecraft can
measure. We can go higher, and we can monitor the planet throughout the
Martian day."

-- Investigating the Atmosphere of Titan --

Gurwell also uses the SMA to measure the upper atmospheric temperature of
Saturn's moon Titan. Before the Cassini spacecraft reached the Saturnian
system, Gurwell was studying Titan to learn more about this enigmatic
moon, whose surface is shrouded by its thick, hazy atmosphere.

"We saw large gradients of hydrogen cyanide and other chemicals between
the northern and southern hemispheres," said Gurwell. "These gradients
tell us about the climate and dynamics of the atmosphere. Plus, since
Titan is an analog to the early Earth, we can use our measurements of
Titan to start to extrapolate what conditions were like on the Earth four
billion years ago, just before life developed."

Continued SMA observations will provide useful information about seasonal
weather patterns on Titan, where a 'year' is nearly 30 Earth years long.

"If we develop an understanding of Titan's climate and seasonal changes,
we may be able to better understand how other atmospheres, including the
Earth's, are affected by changes in seasons," Gurwell explained. "This
could become very important when we begin to study planets around other
stars."
