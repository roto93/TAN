   Title   : Applying N-Body Simulations to Gravitational Lensing
   Time    : 03/04 (Friday) 2:00 PM

   Abstract: Calculating the properties of the low red-shift Universe
             requires us to follow the evolution of density perturbations
             of the early cosmos into the highly non-linear regime.  Such
             calculations currently require the use of computer simulations.
             On large cosmic scales, these simulations are best performed
             using N-Body codes.  The results of these calculations can
             then be tested against the observed Universe.

             Gravitational lensing is becoming an immensely powerful tool
             for probing the low red-shift Universe on many length scales.
             In this talk, I will discuss a number of ways that gravitational
             lensing can be used in conjunction with N-body simulations to
             further our understanding.  In particular, I will focus on
             strong lensing and weak lensing (cosmic shear), but the
             principles under discussion apply equally to other regimes,
             such as micro lensing.
