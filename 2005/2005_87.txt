Hi Yi-Jehng,

We might still have a few spots in our meeting, to be held 
in Lijiang in 3 weeks, for people interested in attending
and presenting results related to extreme starbursts.
Sorry for this very late notice. Please check the meeting
web site for details:

  http://sfig.pmo.ac.cn/   or  http://159.226.72.238/

I'm not sure how easy to get travel documents to come to 
mainland from Taiwan. If it still make sense, perhaps you
can post the meeting web site on TAN so that interested
party can think of coming over.

Thanks much  --Yu
