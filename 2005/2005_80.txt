  J. MAYO GREENBERG SCHOLARSHIP PRIZE


Leiden Observatory and the Leids Universiteitfonds have pleasure in inviting 
applications for the second J. Mayo Greenberg Scholarship Prize

Mrs. Naomi Greenberg and family members of the late Professor J. Mayo Greenberg,
the distinguished Leiden astrophysicist who died on 29 November 2001, have
generously provided funds for this scholarship in memory of Professor Greenberg.

The purpose of the funds is to provide an opportunity for a talented needy 
graduate student to come to Leiden for a period of about 3 months carrying out 
research and/or receiving education at Leiden in one or more of the following 
fields that were of interest to Professor Greenberg: Laboratory astrophysics, 
Comet formation, Interstellar dust and the Origin of life. Although applications 
will be considered from the whole world, preference will be given to applicants 
resident in Asia, Africa or South America.

For students from developing countries, the ICSC - World Laboratory will provide 
additional funding to extend the stay of the student for up to 6 months, making 
a total maximum period for the visit of 9 months.

Applications for the second prize (2006-07 time-frame) should be received before 
30 September 2005. They should include a curriculum vitae and a statement 
containing the purpose for which the grant is requested (including duration) and
