>    'View Participants' on the Symposium homepage. Simply click on your namea
>    and for the sake of security, you will be required to enter the same emaila
>    address provided on your registration. We have improved the registrationa
>    webpage so that two abstracts (one poster, one oral) can be submitteda
>    through the symposium webpage.  You can also take this chance to modify
>    your registration information, for example, arrival and departure details
>    which will be helpful for the LOC. Thank you.

> 2. Prof Dick Manchester has kindly accepted an invitation from the LOC to
>    present a one-day Pulsar Workshop on August 1st. The purpose of this is to
>    give a brief introduction about pulsars to students and those who have just
>    entered this subject.

> 3. The LOC has provided new maps for Urumqi and Xinjiang, please click on
>    "Useful Information" on our symposium webpage and download the maps. For
>    the non-Chinese speakers, we also put an English-Chinese translation in
>    this area, which includes several frequently used sentences. We hope this
>    will be useful for you.

> 4. The climate in different areas of Xinjiang is variable over a wide range.
>    The weather in Urumqi in August is pleasant most of the time, but in Turfan
>    it could go up to more than 45C although you may not feel so bad due to the
>    dry climate. Lake Hanas is situated in the cool temperature zone. In August
>    the mean temperature is around 16C, with relative humidity of 63%.

>    the morning of August 3rd. We come back to Urumqi on the evening of August
>    8th. On August 9, there is an optional visit to Nanshan Observatory, about
>    1.5 hour's drive from Urumqi.

>    deadline.
