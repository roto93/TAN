Subject: SMA Call for Proposals (fwd)

Dear Yi-Jehng,

The email on the SMA proposal, which I just forwarded,
had the deadliine in the USA time. The deadline is
Sep 14, 2005 in Taiwan time. The following is the updated
call for proposal. Please put the following information at TAN
instead of the previous email.

Thanks,
Nagayoshi

Dear Colleagues,

Proposals for Submillimeter Array (SMA) observations for the semester
November 2005 through April 2006 are due on Wednesday, September 14, 2005
in Taiwan time (Tuesday, September 13, 2005 in the US).
The SMA is the first facility for subarcsecond imaging observations at
submillimeter wavelengths, operating in partly transparent atmospheric
windows from 1.4 to 0.4 millimeters, as a collaborative project between
the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO) and the Academia
Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA).

As some of you know, the time allocation process for the SMA observations is 
under change. We are trying to have one unified
Time Allocation Committee (TAC) with the SAO side, but we are not
still sure whether we can start it from this cycle or next.
Meantime, please refer the following web page:

   http://sma1.sma.hawaii.edu/

for instructions and tools for proposal preparation, and
for detailed information about SMA capabilities.
As soon as we have updated information on the proposal submission
procedure and the time allocation process, we will let you know.

The SMA is a powerful but complex instrument; prospective first time
users are encouraged to consult an experienced SMA staff member
for advice in advance of the deadline via smaprop@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw.

Nagayoshi Ohashi

  Dear all,

	Dr. Michael Liu is kindly offering to give another presentation this 
afternoon at 2:00PM on the topic of laser guide star adaptive optics. 
The talk will give some background on the technique and showcase some 
early science results from the Keck LGS AO system.

	Anyone interested in this subject is very welcome to join at Rm 716 
this afternoon!

  best,

  sheng-yuan

   Title   : Early Results from Keck Laser Guide Star Adaptive Optics:
             An Observer's Report from the Front Lines
   Time    : 08/16 (Tue) 2:00 PM
   Location: ASIAA Room 716
   Abstract: LGS AO provides a powerful new instrumental capability for 
high angular resolution science from ground-based telescopes.  Unlike 
natural guide star AO systems, which are restricted to observations 
around bright stars, LGS AO opens up most of the sky to 
diffraction-limited imaging and spectroscopy at infrared wavelengths.  
In the near-future, LGS AO will be deployed on all large ground-based 
telescopes and will provide an enduring platform for high angular 
resolution science.  LGS AO is also a key component in designs of 
next-generation extremely large telescopes.

The Keck II Telescope commissioned the first laser guide star (LGS) 
adaptive optics system on an 8-10 meter class telescope last year.
The system has been carrying out science observations for several 
months now, achieving angular resolutions as good as 0.05" FWHM in the
near-IR, 3-4 time better than Hubble Space Telescope at similar 
wavelengths.  In this informal talk, I present a brief description of 
the
LGS system and its performance, some of the first science results, and 
some early impressions on its merits and weaknesses from the
perspective of one of the first scientific users.
