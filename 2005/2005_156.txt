Lulin One-meter Telescope (LOT): CALL FOR OBSERVING PROPOSALS 

The Lulin One-meter Telescope (LOT) calls for observing time requests for 
the 2006A semester which runs from January 1 to April 30. The semester is 
cut short because of the mirror recoating. In addition to the set of Bessell 
UBVRI filters, some specialized comet and nebulosity filters are also 
available.  A focal reducer to change from f/8 to f/4, thereby doubling the 
FOV, is ready for the semester. Aside from scientific programs, we may also 
consider  "education" projects for advanced observing classes.  The 
observing proposal form can be downloaded from the NCU/IA homepage 
(http://www.astro.ncu.edu.tw ,http://www.lulin.ncu.edu.tw/lot/lot_apply.doc).
The deadline is  December 1, 2005. 

PS. Dear 2005 LOT users, please give us a 1-2 pages report about your 
observing for the coming Lulin observatory annual report. Thank you very 
much for your cooperation.

Regards,

Dear Colleagues,
associated with the NSPO project "Compton Imaging Spectrometer" (CIS), 
we are going to hold the first of a series of annual workshops, the 
CIS workshop 2005, in NTHU, on Nov 15-17. The CIS project is a Taiwan-US
collaboration, whose major members on the Taiwan side (the CIS-Taiwan team)
are from NTU, NTNU, NCU, NTHU, NCTU, NSPO, NUU, and NCKU. On the US side, the
CIS-US team consists of members from UCB/SSL, LBNL, and LLNL.
Being at the beginning stage of this project, the CIS workshop 2005 will mostly
be discussion of technical and collaboration details, in addition to a few 
overview presentations. Nonetheless, all interested persons are welcome to 
freely attend all the sessions. Your potential participation in the CIS project
is also welcome. A preliminary agenda of the workshop is attached below. 
Regards,
