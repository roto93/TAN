Dear TAN subscribers,

Since September 04, the TAN account at ASIAA (astro@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw)
have not been able to receive any incoming emails.  So if you have sent
any message to TAN on/after September 04, i.e., without cc'ing it to me,
could you please send it again to me directly?

At the moment, it seems the problem will not get fixed in a reasonable
time scale due to the slow action of ASIAA's SAs, I have thus decided
to move TAN to a Shida's machine temporally until the sendmail problem
is fixed.  So from now on, please direct your messages to TAN to
`` astro@castor.scc.ntnu.edu.tw '' and better, also cc it to me.

Please accept my sincere apology if TAN has missed any timely messages
you sent because of this sendmail problem.  Sorry for the inconvenience
it may be caused.


Regards,
Yi-Jehng Kuan
TAN administrator
