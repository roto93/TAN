>              Submillimeter Astronomy: in the era of the SMA
>
>                             a conference at
>                    Harvard University, Cambridge, MA
>       Sponsored by the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics
>                             June 13-16, 2005

>* Now is the time to note the dates and to plan to attend.
>* Registration and abstract submission open January 15, deadline April 30.

>The submillimeter wavelength regime provides a unique window on emission
>from cold dust and highly excited lines from molecules, atoms, and ions.
>As the bulk of the visible universe is cold, the submillimeter atmospheric
>windows are as close as we can get to the radiation peak from the ground.
>With the introduction of large format array detectors, a range of
>interesting phenomena from debris disks to high-redshift galaxies have
>been detected and investigated. With the construction of the Submillimeter
>Array, angular resolution better than an arc second has been achieved.
>This meeting will focus on what has been learned, and where the future of
>the field lies, with an eye toward ALMA, the next generation world-wide
>submillimeter facility.
>
>1. Conference Organization
>
>The conference will consist of three and one-half days of sessions of
>Invited Talks (30 minutes) and Contributed Talks (15 minutes).  As time
>for talks is limited, posters will be an important part of the
>presentation. The tentative topics are: high redshift universe, local
>galaxies, star formation, evolved stars, chemistry, debris disks, solar
>system objects, and instrumentation.
>
>The conference web site contains all the current information and updates:
>  http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/smast05
>You can sign up on the web site to receive future announcements.
>
>There will be no formal proceedings volume, but we plan to make the
>presentations available on the conference website.
>
