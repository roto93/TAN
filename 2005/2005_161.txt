TIARA Winter School on Cosmology


sponsored by the Academia Sinica and National Science Council

National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan: February 13-17, 2006

The last decade has seen a transformation of cosmology from a qualitative
subject to a precision science. This winter school is aimed at graduate
students and advanced undergraduates to present an up-to-date background
and overview of observational and theoretical physical cosmology.
The lectures will cover basic background from relativistic cosmological
perturbation theory to current issues in dark matter and dark energy.
