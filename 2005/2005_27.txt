The 2005 Annual Meeting of the Chinese Astronomical Society (Taiwan)
will be held in National Central University on June 3-4, 2005. 
Papers in all fields of astronomy and astrophysics are solicited.
This is the annual meeting for astronomers and astrophysicists in Taiwan
to report their research and to exchange their ideas.
 
The two-day annual meeting will include plenary invited talks, parallel
scientific sessions, poster presentation, forum on astronomy education,
and business meetings. We are pleased to announce that two plenary 
invited talks will be given by Prof. Makishima from Tokyo University on
"A new X-ray window to be opened with Astro-E2" and by Prof. Filippenko from
UC Berkeley on "Evidence from Type Ia Supernovae for a Decelerating, then 
Accelerating Universe and Dark Energy". More details will be announced in 
the final circular.

Participants should register on-line at the CAST 2005 web site 
<http://www.cast.org.tw/> by April 30, 2005. 
A registration fee of NTD 500 should be paid on site, upon which the annual 
membership fee can be waived. Abstract submission should also be carried out 
via the meeting web site by April 30, 2005. The Program Committee will 
announce the final program by May 20, 2005.

The Program Committee and the Organizing Committee sincerely 
invite you to participate all these activities. For further details and

Subject: [Colloquium] ASIAA Colloquium This Friday (03/04)


  Dear all,

 	This Friday, we will have a colloquium talk presented by Dr. Adam
  Amara visiting from Institute of Astronomy at University of Cambridge.
  Dr. Amara will discuss his research in computational cosmology with a talk
  titled "Applying N-Body Simulations to Gravitational Lensing'.

 	Please mark your calendar and remember to join!

  Regards,

  sheng-yuan

  ------------------------ ASIAA Colloquium ------------------------
   Speaker : Dr. Adam Amara (IoA, University of Cambridge)
   Title   : Applying N-Body Simulations to Gravitational Lensing
   Time    : 03/04 (Friday) 2:00 PM
   Location: ASIAA Room 716
   URL     : http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/act/colloquium.php
   Abstract: Calculating the properties of the low red-shift Universe
             requires us to follow the evolution of density perturbations
             of the early cosmos into the highly non-linear regime.  Such
             calculations currently require the use of computer simulations.
             On large cosmic scales, these simulations are best performed
             using N-Body codes.  The results of these calculations can
             then be tested against the observed Universe.

             Gravitational lensing is becoming an immensely powerful tool
             for probing the low red-shift Universe on many length scales.
             In this talk, I will discuss a number of ways that gravitational
             lensing can be used in conjunction with N-body simulations to
             further our understanding.  In particular, I will focus on
             strong lensing and weak lensing (cosmic shear), but the
             principles under discussion apply equally to other regimes,
             such as micro lensing.
