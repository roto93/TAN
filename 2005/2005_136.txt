Dear people,

I would like to remind you that deadline of registration for the
East Asian Young Astronomers Meeting 2006 will come soon.
Organizers of this meeting say that only 4 people from Taiwan have
registered already and they are strongly encouraging Taiwanese young
astronomers to attend the meeting.
The meeting will be held in Kiyosato, where is one of nice
places to enjoy sky activity near Tokyo.

Cheers,
Satoko

> Dear colleage,
>
> In Nov. 2003, Taiwanese young astronomers organized East Asian Young
> Astronomers Meeting 2003 (EAYAM 2003), and it was a great success. In
> Oct. 2004, 6th East Asia Meeting for Astronomy (EAMA6) has settled a
> working group for EAYAM, and this working group encourages young
> astronomers to have EAYAM every 2-3 years so that all the PhD course
> students have a chance to attend it at least once during their course.
>
> Here, we are pleased to announce that the East Asian Young Astronomers
> Meeting 2006 (hereafter, EAYAM 2006) will be held in Kiyosato, Nagano,
> Japan from 13-18 Feb. 2006. The main topic of the invited reviews is
> ``Comprehensive Understanding of Star Formation and its Evolution'',
> and it is mainly divided into following three categories:
>
>   (1) Star Formation and Radio Astronomy,
>   (2) Evolution of Stars and Optical / Infrared Astronomy,
>   (3) Final Stage of Stellar Evolution and High Energy Astrophysics.
>
> The contributed talks, however, are not limited to these topics.
>
> This meeting is organized by Japanese young astronomers, and invites
> young astronomers in four of the EAMA core regions, China, Japan,
> Korea and Taiwan. We also certainly welcome contributions from young
> astronomers who are originally from one of these regions and are
> currently engaged in research activities abroad. The aim of the
> meeting is to encourage the interaction among young astronomers of
> neighboring regions, and thus, to provide an opportunity for future
> international collaborations. All the participants are expected to
> give both oral and poster presentation in order to stimulate
> discussions and interactions.
>
> The number of participants from each region will be approximately
> 12. Postdocs and graduate students are encouraged to participate. We
> will provide meals and accommodations during the meeting and
> transportation between Tokyo and Kiyosato. Due to the limited budget,
> we cannot cover your travel expense between your home institute and
> Tokyo.
>
> To register and submit an abstract, please visit following website:
>
>   http://th.nao.ac.jp/~eayam/

> The deadline is postponed from the initial date of 30 September
> 2005. New deadline of the abstract submission is 15 October 2005. If
> you have any question on EAYAM 2006, please contact to
> <eayam06_info@th.nao.ac.jp>.

> This meeting is supported by National Astronomical Observatory of
> Japan, RIKEN, Inoue Science Foundation, Foundation for Promotion of
> Astronomy, and individual astronomers in Japan.
