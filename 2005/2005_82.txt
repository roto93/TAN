Mrs. Naomi Greenberg and family members of the late Professor J. Mayo Greenberg,

Comet formation, Interstellar dust and the Origin of life. Although applications 
will be considered from the whole world, preference will be given to applicants 
resident in Asia, Africa or South America.

For students from developing countries, the ICSC - World Laboratory will provide 
additional funding to extend the stay of the student for up to 6 months, making 
a total maximum period for the visit of 9 months.
