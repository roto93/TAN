  Dear all,

        This Friday, we will have a colloquium presented by Dr. Je-An Gu
  from Department of Physics at National Taiwan University. Dr. Gu has been
  working on the topic of cosmic evolution. In Friday's talk, he will discuss
  his very recent research about the acceleration of a dust universe.

        Please mark your calendar and remember to join!

  Regards,

  sheng-yuan

   Speaker : Dr. Je-An Gu (National Taiwan University)
   Title   : Inhomogeneity-Induced Cosmic Acceleration in A Dust Universe
   Time    : 11/18 (Fri) 2:00 PM
   Location: ASIAA Room 716
   Abstract:
             It is the common intuition and consensus that the expansion
             of a universe always slows down if the gravitational force
             provided by the energy sources therein is attractive universally.
             To this consensus we find counter examples for a spherically
             symmetric dust universe described by the Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi
             solution. Thus, the validity of this naive intuition is indeed
             doubtful and the effects of inhomogeneities should be restudied.
             These examples open a new point of view for understanding
             the evolution of our universe.
