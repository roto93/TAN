This is an announcement of the Kobe International School of Planetary
Sciences 2005. This school aims to promote lively international
interaction in planetary science and to educate graduate students and
young researchers from all over the world. This international school
is held annually, and last year's topic was ``Diversity of the Planets''.

This year, the focus will be on the ``Origin of Planetary Systems'',
which will cover protoplanetary disks, brown dwarfs, gas giant
planets, terrestrial planets, planetesimals, extrasolar planets and
the dynamical evolution of planetary systems. The school will consist
of lectures by international experts on both observational and
theoretical aspects.

This school is supported by the 21st Century Center of Excellence
Program: ``Origin and Evolution of Planetary Systems'' at Kobe
University.

We look forward to receiving your application.
