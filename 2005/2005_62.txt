Dear all,

Due to some network problems of ASIAA occurred over last weekend
(May 21-23), mails sent to TAN account (astro@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw)
might have lost.  This incident could actually affect mails up to
today (May 27) as a result of file system reconfiguration.

If you did send in mails to TAN during this time, please send it
to TAN again.  Sorry for the inconvenience.

Regards,
Yi-Jehng Kuan
TAN administrator
