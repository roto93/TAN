Subject: ALMA-T meeting

Dear Colleagues,

  As you may know, the ASIAA has been negotiating with Japan to join the
ALMA project through ALMA-Japan (ALMA-J).  It is widely anticipated that
ALMA will complement and provide entirely new insights on a broad range
of topics in astronomical research, from the Solar System to the most
distant galaxies.  Our goal is to make possible and maximize the
opportunity to use ALMA to all Taiwan astronomers on an equal basis.
  We have been meeting regularly with ALMA-J representatives over the
last 2 years or so to explore ways in which we can participate in
ALMA-J. Our next meeting is scheduled for September 9, at which time we
plan to invite representatives outside ASIAA to join.  Before this
meeting, we would like to meet with the Taiwan astronomy community to
explain our plans, and most importantly to seek input from the
community.  We hope to hold the first of such meetings on September 6
(Tuesday) at National Central University.  The agenda and schedule of the
meeting is appended below.
  We look forward to seeing you all there.  It would help our local
organization if you could email Linda Shao at lshao@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw to
let us know if you can attend by 2 Sep.

sincerely,
Paul Ho
