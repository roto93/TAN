Dear colleagues,

This Friday we will have another colloquium presented
by Dr. Jumpei Takata, who is currently TIARA postdoctoral
fellow. Dr. J. Takata works mainly in pulsar and high
energy astrophysics. He will share with us his recent research
results on the particle acceleration in the magnetosphere of
pulsars. So please mark your calendar and join the talk to 
learn more about these exciting research results.

Speaker: Dr. Jumpei Takata (TIARA)

Title: Electrodynamical study on acceleration in pulsar magnetosphere

Date/time: 02:00 pm Friday, Sep. 30, 2005

Place: conference room, R.716

Summary:

Rapidly rotating young pulsars such as the Crab pulsar is one of the origins
of cosmic high energy gamma-rays and particles. The electrons and positrons
are accelerated to ~10TeV and emit the gamma-rays above 1GeV in the pulsar
magnetosphere. The particle acceleration mechanism in the pulsar magnetosphere
have been studied by many astronomers since discovery of the pulsar in 1969.
However, the problem is not conclusive up to now.

In resent work, we have developed the electrodynamical study on the particle
acceleration at the outer magnetosphere. We have self-consistently solved the
accelerating electric field, radiation process and pair-creation process with
the current in the meridional plane with a 2-dimensional model for the first
time. We find that the acceleration start point shifts toward the stellar
surface as the current increases. We demonstrate that the gamma-ray spectrum
hardness strongly depends on the current. We apply the model to the Vela
pulsar. We discuss the structure of the acceleration region of the Vela pulsar
by comparing the model spectrum with the observed one.

Best regards,

Trung

Dear Prof. Kuan,

Could you please distribute following announcement to TAN network?

Thank you,

Dear colleage,

We have decided to change the deadline of the submission of abstract
and registration because of following two reasons;

  (1) new semester in China and Taiwan has just started,
  (2) the annual meeting of the Astronomical Society of Japan is
      coming just after the current deadline (30/Sep/2005).

New deadline for submission of abstract is set to 15 October 2005.

                       First Announcement

      East Asian Young Astronomers Meeting 2006 (EAYAM 2006)
                     Kiyosato, Yamanashi, Japan
                       13-18 February 2006

                   http://th.nao.ac.jp/~eayam/


Dear colleage,

In Nov. 2003, Taiwanese young astronomers organized East Asian Young
Astronomers Meeting 2003 (EAYAM 2003), and it was a great success. In
Oct. 2004, 6th East Asia Meeting for Astronomy (EAMA6) has settled a
working group for EAYAM, and this working group encourages young
astronomers to have EAYAM every 2-3 years so that all the PhD course
students have a chance to attend it at least once during their course.

Here, we are pleased to announce that the East Asian Young Astronomers
Meeting 2006 (hereafter, EAYAM 2006) will be held in Kiyosato,
Yamanashi, Japan from 13-18 Feb. 2006. The main topic of the invited
reviews is ``Comprehensive Understanding of Star Formation and its
Evolution'', and it is mainly divided into following three categories:

  (1) Star Formation and Radio Astronomy,
  (2) Evolution of Stars and Optical / Infrared Astronomy,
  (3) Final Stage of Stellar Evolution and High Energy Astrophysics.

The contributed talks, however, are not limited to these topics.

This meeting is organized by Japanese young astronomers, and invites
young astronomers in four of the EAMA core regions, China, Japan,
Korea and Taiwan. We also certainly welcome contributions from young
astronomers who are originally from one of these regions and are
currently engaged in research activities abroad. The aim of the
meeting is to encourage the interaction among young astronomers of
neighboring regions, and thus, to provide an opportunity for future
international collaborations. All the participants are expected to
give both oral and poster presentation in order to stimulate
discussions and interactions.

The number of participants from each region will be approximately
12. Postdocs and graduate students are encouraged to participate. We
will provide meals and accommodations during the meeting and
transportation between Tokyo and Kiyosato. Due to the limited budget,
we cannot cover your travel expense between your home institute and
Tokyo.

To register and submit an abstract, please visit following website:

  http://th.nao.ac.jp/~eayam/

The deadline is postponed from the initial date of 30 September
2005. New deadline of the abstract submission is 15 October 2005. If
you have any question on EAYAM 2006, please contact to
<eayam06_info@th.nao.ac.jp>.

This meeting is supported by National Astronomical Observatory of
Japan, RIKEN, Inoue Science Foundation, Foundation for Promotion of
Astronomy, and individual astronomers in Japan.
