Lulin One-meter Telescope (LOT): CALL FOR OBSERVING PROPOSALS 

The Lulin One-meter Telescope (LOT) calls for observing time requests for 
the 2006A semester which runs from January 1 to April 30. The semester is 
cut short because of the mirror recoating. In addition to the set of Bessell 
UBVRI filters, some specialized comet and nebulosity filters are also 
available.  A focal reducer to change from f/8 to f/4, thereby doubling the 
FOV, is ready for the semester. Aside from scientific programs, we may also 
consider  "education" projects for advanced observing classes.  The 
observing proposal form can be downloaded from the NCU/IA homepage 
(http://www.astro.ncu.edu.tw ,http://www.lulin.ncu.edu.tw/lot/lot_apply.doc).
The deadline is  December 1, 2005. 

PS. Dear 2005 LOT users, please give us a 1-2 pages report about your 
observing for the coming Lulin observatory annual report. Thank you very 
much for your cooperation.

Regards,
