Dear colleagues,

This Friday we will have another colloquium presented
by Dr. Jumpei Takata, who is currently TIARA postdoctoral
fellow. Dr. J. Takata works mainly in pulsar and high
energy astrophysics. He will share with us his recent research
results on the particle acceleration in the magnetosphere of
pulsars. So please mark your calendar and join the talk to 
learn more about these exciting research results.

Speaker: Dr. Jumpei Takata (TIARA)

Title: Electrodynamical study on acceleration in pulsar magnetosphere

Date/time: 02:00 pm Friday, Sep. 30, 2005

Place: conference room, R.716

Summary:

Rapidly rotating young pulsars such as the Crab pulsar is one of the origins
of cosmic high energy gamma-rays and particles. The electrons and positrons
are accelerated to ~10TeV and emit the gamma-rays above 1GeV in the pulsar
magnetosphere. The particle acceleration mechanism in the pulsar magnetosphere
have been studied by many astronomers since discovery of the pulsar in 1969.
However, the problem is not conclusive up to now.

In resent work, we have developed the electrodynamical study on the particle
acceleration at the outer magnetosphere. We have self-consistently solved the
accelerating electric field, radiation process and pair-creation process with
the current in the meridional plane with a 2-dimensional model for the first
time. We find that the acceleration start point shifts toward the stellar
surface as the current increases. We demonstrate that the gamma-ray spectrum
hardness strongly depends on the current. We apply the model to the Vela
pulsar. We discuss the structure of the acceleration region of the Vela pulsar
by comparing the model spectrum with the observed one.

Best regards,

Trung
