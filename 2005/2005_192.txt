Dear Prof. Hsiang-Kuang Chang,

There is an important notice to all Suzaku proposers
on recent perfomance of Suzaku.
Please distribute this message to your colleagues.

Subject: low energy efficiency of Suzaku

 December 20, 2005

The good low energy response of the back illuminated (BI) CCD,
i.e. the high detection efficiency and the gaussian-like good energy
spread function, is an important unique feature of Suzaku. However, we
recently found evidence that the effective area below 1 keV of both
back- and front-illuminated sensors is decreasing with time (see
figures in the Suzaku web page,
http://www.astro.isas.jaxa.jp/suzaku/). On the average at 0.6 keV the
effective area is about 50% that just after launch. We are working
hard to understand the cause of decrease and to find possible recovery
methods.  The present best estimate of the e-folding time constant is
160 days at the OVII line (570 eV), but it can be shorter at lower
energies and is longer at higher energies.  However, at present we
cannot predict the future long-term behavior of efficiency
well. Because of this we will put the priority on the low energy
observations as soon as possible during AO1. And we will provide the
response functions (rmf files) of the XIS as of October 26, 2005 on
the suzaku web page soon.  Please note in your proposal which response
function is used to estimate the observation times.

Please note that the energy resolution has not changed.

  Dear all,

 	This Friday we will have a colloquium talk presented by Dr.
  Jennifer Karr. Dr. Karr joined IAA just two months ago. She has been
  involved in various projects with the Spitzer Space Telescope. On
  Friday, she will discuss the SED of young stellar objects viewed by
  Spitzer.

  	Please mark your calendar and remember to join!

  Regards,

  sheng-yuan

  ------------------------- ASIAA Colloquium -----------------------
   Speaker : Dr. Jennifer Karr (ASIAA)
   Title   : Interpreting Spitzer Colours of Young Stellar Objects
   Time    : 12/23 (Fri) 2:00 PM
   Location: ASIAA Room 716
   Abstract:
             The Spitzer Space telescope is providing an unprecedented
             opportunity for the study of young stars. I will discussing
             the observational properties of YSOs at Spitzer wavelengths,
             and the interpretation of their colours and SEDs. In particular,
             archived data from the Infrared Space Observatory has been
             used to provide a comparison sample of colours and SEDs of
             YSOs of known type. These data are then compared with the
             properties of catalogues derived from the Spitzer Galactic
             First Look Survey.
