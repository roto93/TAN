Subject: [Colloquium] ASIAA Colloquium (08/12 Friday)


  Dear all,

 	This Friday Mr. Danie Liang, once also a member of IAA, will
   present a colloquium talk titled "Production of Oxidants in the
   Atmosphere of a Snowball Earth: Implication for the Appearance of
   Oxygen Photosynthesis". Danie has been studying at Caltech and
   working with Prof. Yuk Yung on many key planeratry atmosphere
   problems. This time, he extends his touch to something related to
   biology.

 	Mark your calendar and remember to join this interesting talk!

  Regards,

  sheng-yuan

   Speaker : Mr. Danie Liang (California Institute of Technology)
   Title   : Production of Oxidants in the Atmosphere of a Snowball Earth:
                Implication for the Appearance of Oxygen Photosynthesis
   Time    : 08/12 (Fri) 2:00 PM
   Location: ASIAA Room 716
   Abstract: During Proterozoic time, Earth experienced two intervals with
             one or more episodes of low-latitude glaciation, which are
             probable 'Snowball Earth' events. Snowball conditions are
             associated with the nearly complete shutdown of the hydrological
             cycle and severe curtailment of biological activity. We show
             here that, during such long and severe glacial intervals, a
             weak hydrological cycle coupled with photochemical reactions
             involving water vapor would give rise to the sustained
             production and sequestration of hydrogen peroxide. This
             compound would be buried in the snow/ice and would accumulate
             over the lifetime of the Snowball. The accumulated oxidant
             would be released directly into the ocean upon melting and
             could explain the massive deposition of Mn oxides in post-glacial
             sediments such as those of the Kalahari Manganese Field in
             South Africa and the Urucum Formation in Brazil. Low levels of
             peroxides generated during Archean and earliest Proterozoic
             non-Snowball glacial intervals could have driven the evolution
             of oxygen-mediating enzymes and thereby paved the way for the
             eventual appearance of oxygenic photosynthesis.
