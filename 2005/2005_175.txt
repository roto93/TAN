Dear colleagues, 

The project PI and science PI of the Pan-STARRS project, Nick Kaiser and
Ken Chambers, are scheduled to visit us from December 19 to 22.  The main
purpose of their visit is to discuss about the planned collaboration, in
particular how the OIR astronomy community can contribute to, and take
advantage of, the unique PS dataset.  On December 22, Thursday, starting
at 10 am, there will be an open session for which the Hawaiian and
Taiwanese groups will present the project status and summarize the results 
of the negotiation/discussion of their visit.  All are welcomed to express 
your concerns and share your thought.

           Time: December 22, Thursday, 10 am
