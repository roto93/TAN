Hi all,

We are going to have a colloquium this Friday (Oct. 7).

------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

Date & Time     : Oct. 7 (Fri.), 14:00 - 15:00
Place:          : ASIAA conference room, R716
Speaker         : Dr. Michel Nuevo (NCU)
Topic           : Laboratory simulations of UV irradiation of interstellar
                  ice analogs

<< Abstract >>
rradiation of interstellar-like ices, i.e. containing molecules such as  
H2O, CO, CH4, CH3OH, or NH3 in laboratory using UV light leads to the  
production of complex molecules, some them having been identified in  
the interstellar medium (ISM), from infrared observations (space  
telescope ISO). If we keep on irradiating, more complex molecules,  
stable at room temperature, are formed. The so-obtained refractory  
residues can be analysed by chemical techniques such as  
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or gaz chromatography  
coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS). A great variety of organic  
molecules could be identified, among which amino acids such as glycine  
and alanine, likely to have played an important role in prebiotic  
chemistry on the primitive Earth. Another set of experiments, using the  
with circularly polarized UV synchrotron radiation of the SU5 beamline  
at LURE was also performed. The main goal was to quantify the  
enantiomeric excess (e.e.) for the amino acids formed, and to estimate  
the uncertainties and systematic effects on the measurements, appearing  
when using GC-MS. The results show that, in our experimental  
conditions, this effect is weak, i.e. the excess calculated for alanine  
and DAP, a non-proteinaceous amino acid, were found to be of the order  
of 1%, which is also the order of magnitude as the estimated detection  
limit. These results were compared with the e.e.s found in primitive  
meteorites such as Murchison, and discussed in the context of the  
photochemical processes present in the ISM.
