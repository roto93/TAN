Dear Yi Jehng:

I just returned from Poland this morning.  Can you distribute this notice 
through TAN?

Thanks,

Sun

The next evolved stars meeting will be held on July 7 (Thursday) at 2 pm in 
716.  The abstract of the talk is given below.

The present and future of evolved stars research at IAA

Sun Kwok

The late stages of stellar evolution provide the key to the solution of a 
number of fundamental topics of modern astrophysics and astrochemistry. The 
elements helium, carbon, and many heavy elements are synthesized during the 
AGB, and their abundance can be determined by absorption or emission 
spectroscopy for comparison with theories of nucleosynthesis. The basic 
structure of planetary nebulae (PN) of a torus plus bipolar lobes is similar to 
those of YSO and AGNs, and the development of an understanding of the shaping 
of PN will bear significant implications on these phenomena.  Although the 
basic 1-D structures such as shells, crowns and haloes can be understood by a 
self-consistent model of interacting winds and time-dependent photoionization, 
the discoveries of arcs, rings, FLIERS, point-symmetric and multi-polar 
structures of PN pose new challenges of our understanding of the dynamical 
processes.  AGB stars and PN represent a major source of interstellar grains of 
both inorganic and organic compositions and the detection of unidentified 
features such as the 21 and 30 micron features and the ERE suggest that our 
understanding of grain chemistry is still very primitive.

Current observational projects at IAA include (1) mid-infrared imaging and 
spectroscopy of dust emission in PN by the Gemini Telescopes; (2) optical and 
near-IR imaging with the ionized gas and H2 components of PN with HST, CFHT and 
other ground-based telescopes; (3) submillimeter imaging of the molecular gas 
and dust components by the SMA; (4) molecular spectroscopy of AGB stars and PN 
with the ARO 10m and 12m telescopes.  The abundance of s-process elements are 
being pursued through optical spectroscopy of PPN.  The distribution of 
aromatic species and ERE can be derived through infrared and optical imaging 
spectroscopy at Gemini.  The recent Spitzer IRAC survey of the galactic plane 
has discovered many new nebulae with extremely red colors and the follow up of 
these objects by ground-based imaging is underway.
