Subject: [Colloquium] ASIAA Colloquium (06/02 Thu)


  Dear all,

        This Thursday (06/02), we will have a colloquium presented by
  Dr. Eduardo Martin from IAC, Spain. Dr. Martin is an expert in various
  stellar astrophysics topics, brown dwarfs in particular. On Thursday,
  he will give a review talk on this subject.

        Please mark your calendar for this SPECIAL schedule and remember
  to join! You can go to "http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/act/colloquium.php"

   Speaker : Prof. Eduardo Martin (IAC, Spain)
   Title   : A Decade of Brown Dwarf Discoveries
   Time    : 06/02 (Thu) 2:00 PM
   Location: ASIAA Room 716
   Abstract: Indeed 10 years have passed since the first brown dwarfs
             were discovered (Gl 229B, PPl 15, and Teide 1). These objects
             paved the way for a rapid development of a new subfield in
             astrophysics which has led to finding many new ultracool dwarfs
             in the solar vicinity, and very low-mass objects in star-forming
             regions and open clusters down to a few Jupiter masses. The
             theory of atmospheres and evolution of brown dwarfs has developed
             considerably, and our understanding of brown dwarf formation
             has become a hot matter of debate. Two new spectral classes
             have been proposed to characterize the spectral properties of
             these objects: the L class for dusty dwarfs, and the T class
             for methane dwarfs. I will review the main highlights of these
             discoveries, and the overall properties of brown dwarfs, and
             their relationship to stars and planets. I will conclude
             discussing challenges for future research on brown dwarfs.
