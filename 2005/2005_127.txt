Subject: Colloquium this Thursday Sep. 28, 2005
Date: Sun, 25 Sep 2005 15:40:38 +0800

Dear colleagues,

This Thursday we will have a colloquium presented by 
Dr. Edith Falgarone from France, who is visiting us
for a few days.
She will talk about her exciting research on the turbulence in
ISM. So please mark your calendar and attend her talk.

Speaker: Dr. Edith Falgarone, 
LERMA/LRA, Ecole Normale Superieure & Observatoire de Paris, France

Title: Dissipative structures of the diffuse ISM: chemical and H2 line
excitation diagnostics 

Date/time: 02:00 pm, Thursday Sep. 29, 2005

Place: Our conference room R.716

Summary:
The non-thermal energy of turbulence in the cold diffuse medium exceeds by far
the gas thermal energy. Its dissipation is intermittent in space and time and
locally deposits large amounts of non-thermal energy in the gas, modifying its
subsequent thermal, chemical and dynamical evolution. Observations with the
IRAM-Plateau de Bure interferometer suggest that dissipation may occur at
scales ~700 AU or smaller. Recent attempts have been made at modelling the
coupled impulsive heating and chemical enrichment in dissipation bursts
followed by thermal and chemical relaxation of the gas. The signatures of such
processes, although occuring in only a few percents of the diffuse gas, may
have been observed in the excitation of the rotational levels of H2 molecule
and the detection of large abundances of molecules such as HCO+ and CH+, in
diffuse molecular gas.

 
Best regards,

Trung

Dear colleagues,

This Wednesday Sep. 28, 2005 we will have two special colloquia
presented by our visitors from Japan on shock-wave in
proto-planetary disks and the effect on chondrule formation. 
information on the talks are attached in the following. 
Please mark your calendar and come to the talks to learn more about 
these new research results.
