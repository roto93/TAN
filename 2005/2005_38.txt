Subject: [Colloquium] Special ASIAA Colloquia This Week (03/21 and 03/23)
 
  Dear all,
 
        In addition to the two lunch talks by Dr. Tanigawa and Dr. Tosaki,
  there will also be a number of special colloquium talks this coming week
  kindly offered by our advisory panel members. On Monday (03/21) afternoon
  at 3:30PM, Prof. Ronald Taam will talk about ultra compact low mass X-Ray
  binaries. On Wednesday (03/23) afternoon starting from 2:00PM, both Prof.
  You-Hua Chu and Prof. Erick Young will share with us their recent research
  results from the Spitzer Space Telescope.
 
        Please notice the special time of these talks and remember to join!
  You can go to "http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/act/colloquium.php" for more
  ASIAA colloquia info.
 
 
  Regards,

  ------------------------ ASIAA Colloquium ------------------------
   Speaker : Prof. Ronald Taam (Northwestern University)
   Title   : Ultra Compact Low mass X-Ray Binaries
   Time    : 03/21 (Mon) 3:30 PM
   Location: ASIAA Room 716
 
  ------------------------ ASIAA Colloquium ------------------------
   Speaker : Prof. You-Hua Chu (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign)
   Title   : Spitzer View of Star Formation in the Large Magellanic Cloud
   Time    : 03/23 (Wed) 2:00 PM
   Location: ASIAA Room 716
   Abstract: The Spitzer Space Telescope, having a high angular resolution
             at mid-IR wavelength range, is able to reveal protostars in
             the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) at 50 kpc away. We were awarded
             IRAC and MIPS observations of 7 LMC HII regions in Cycle 1.
             We have received IRAC images of six objects so far. A large
             number of embedded protostars are detected. Many of these are
             high-mass stars that have been difficult to identify in the
             Galaxy because of confusion and uncertain distances. Combined
             with multi-wavelength data, it is possible to clearly identify
             triggered star formation. Follow-up observations are planned to
             study star formation in the LMC both in physical details and on
             a global scale.
