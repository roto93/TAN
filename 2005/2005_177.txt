  ------------------------- ASIAA Colloquium -----------------------
   Speaker : Prof. K.L. Chan
             (Hong Kong University of Science and Technology)
   Title   : Dynamics of Atmospheres in the Solar System
   Time    : 12/09 (Fri) 2:00 PM
   Location: ASIAA Room 716
   Abstract:
             Our solar system hosts extreme conditions and a wide variety
             of atmospheric behavior. Exploration of the various atmospheres
             not only enhances our appreciation of the uniqueness and the
             fragility of our Earth's atmosphere, but is also a necessity
             for the preparation of human visits to other planets. I offer
             to accompany the audience through a hopping tour for interesting
             atmospheric phenomena in our solar system, with occasional simple
             explanations.
