Dear Colleagues,

I would like bring the upcoming cosmology winter school to your 
attention, and ask for your help to forward this information to 
interested students.

Best,

TIARA Winter School on Cosmology


sponsored by the Academia Sinica and National Science Council

National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan: February 13-17, 2006

The last decade has seen a transformation of cosmology from a qualitative
subject to a precision science. This winter school is aimed at graduate
students and advanced undergraduates to present an up-to-date background
and overview of observational and theoretical physical cosmology.
The lectures will cover basic background from relativistic cosmological
perturbation theory to current issues in dark matter and dark energy.

  Dear all,

 	This week, we will have TWO colloquia:
 	On Wednesday (11/23), our visitor, Dr. Dimitris Stamatellos from
  Cardiff University, will discuss with us about his reasearch on star
  forming cores in his talk titled "Observational Characteristics of
  Prestellar Cores and Very Young Protostars".
 	On Friday (11/25), Dr. Kazutaka Motoyama will come from TIARA to
  present his recent reasearch in the talk titled "Radiation Driven Implosion
  Model for High Accretion Rate of Protostar"

 	Please mark your calendar and remember to join!

  Regards,

  sheng-yuan
