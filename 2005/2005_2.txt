Dear colleagues,

The 11th Star and Telescope workshop (ST-11) will be held at the Department 
of Physics, National Cheng-Kung University on 18 Mar 2005, Friday.
This one-day workshop will focus on:

1. The scientific product of LOT programs;
2. The operation and management of LOT;
3. The prospect of OIR initiatives, including national observatory.

Since ST11 will be held in time between the Physics (February) and Astronomy 
(June) Society Annual meetings, those who miss the chance to talk in those
meetings are encouraged to present their research work at ST11. Specifically
we shall brainstorm on measures to make LOT scientifically productive.

For participants who want to arrive earlier and leave later, LOC can help to
reserve accomodations in NCKU Guesthouse. Due to the limited number of 
available rooms, please inform us as early as possible if you need a
reservation.
Any suggestions and comments are welcome and we hope to see you in ST11 in 
Tainan!


Regards,
Alfred Chen
