Dear Colleageus,

  As you may know, the ASIAA has been negotiating with Japan to join
the ALMA project through ALMA-Japan (ALMA-J).  It is widely anticipated
that ALMA will complement and provide entirely new insights on a broad
range of topics in astronomical research, from the Solar System to the
most distant galaxies.  Our goal is to make possible and maximize the
opportunity to use ALMA to all Taiwan astronomers on an equal basis.

  We have been meeting regularly with ALMA-J representatives over the
last 2 years or so to explore ways in which we can participate in ALMA-J.
Our next meeting is scheduled for September 9, at which time we plan to
invite representatives outside ASIAA to join.  Before this meeting, we
would like to meet with the Taiwan astronomy community to explain our
plans, and most importantly to seek input from the community.  We hope
to hold the first of such meetings on September 6 (Tuesday), at 9:30 am,
at National Central University.

  We look forward to seeing you all there.
