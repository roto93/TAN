Inaugural Japan-Taiwan ALMA Science Workshop


In September 2005, the Academia Sinica of the Republic of China (ROC) signed
an agreement with the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ) to
participate in the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) project through
ALMA-Japan (ALMA-J).  For the Taiwanese scientific community, this agreement
provides access to scientific observations with the ALMA on an equal basis
with the Japanese scientific community.  For the Japanese scientific
community, fruitful and extensive scientific collaborations can be possible
between Taiwan and Japan with this agreement.

Early scientific observations with the partially complete ALMA may be possible
as soon as 2007.  It is therefore timely and with some urgency that Japan
and Taiwan are planning the first of what is anticipated to be a series of
joint ALMA Japan-Taiwan (ALMA-JT) scientific workshops.  The inaugural
workshop is planned for 15-16 December 2005, in Taipei, to be hosted by the
ASIAA. The primary objectives of the first workshop are for the partners to
learn about each other's scientific interests in the hope of promoting
mutually beneficial collaborations, and move towards joint planning for 
early science with the ALMA.  It is proposed that such a workshop will be
held approximately twice a year alternatively in Japan and Taiwan.

The SOC is making final preparations for invited speakers.  In the meantime,
we invite both the Taiwan and Japan scientific community to register for the
workshop and provide a title and abstract of your suggested oral contribution
at http://alma.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/activities/workshop2005/.  We anticipate
that the scientific program will focus on the Solar System, Star Formation,
Evolved Stars, Interstellar Medium, Galaxies (near and far), and Cosmology,
but other topics are welcome.  We particularly encourage theoretical
astrophysicists and students to participate.  For Taiwan-based astronomers
living outside Taipei, we strongly encourage residence in Taipei during the
Workshop to continue interactions in the evenings.  The dateline for
registration is 13 November 2005.

sincerely,
Jeremy Lim (ASIAA), co-Chair SOC
Satoshi Yamomoto (University of Tokyo), co-Chair SOC
