Dear TAN subscribers,

This issue of TAN is a re-sent of the earlier issue (Dec 22-26)
because of a mail server problem occurred at ASIAA. I apologize
if you have already received this TAN message yesterday. Also,
if you had sent in emails to TAN for announcement on Dec 25-27
(Sunday-Tuesday), please resend it to TAN as they probably got
lost.  Sorry for the trouble.

Yi-Jehng Kuan
