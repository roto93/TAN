  Dear all,

        This week, Dr. Guo-Chin Liu will present a colloquium talk titled
  "CMB Induced Polarisation from Clusters and Filaments". Guo-Chin spent
  most of his time during the past year at Institut d'Astrophysique Spatiale.
  We will hear from him the exciting results and experiences from his long
  visit to France.

        Please mark your calendar and join the talk!

  Regards,

  sheng-yuan

>              Submillimeter Astronomy: in the era of the SMA
>
>                             a conference at
>                    Harvard University, Cambridge, MA
>       Sponsored by the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics
>                             June 13-16, 2005

>
>* Now is the time to note the dates and to plan to attend.
>* Registration and abstract submission open January 15, deadline April 30.
>
>The submillimeter wavelength regime provides a unique window on emission
>from cold dust and highly excited lines from molecules, atoms, and ions.
>As the bulk of the visible universe is cold, the submillimeter atmospheric
>windows are as close as we can get to the radiation peak from the ground.
>With the introduction of large format array detectors, a range of
>interesting phenomena from debris disks to high-redshift galaxies have
>been detected and investigated. With the construction of the Submillimeter
>Array, angular resolution better than an arc second has been achieved.
>This meeting will focus on what has been learned, and where the future of
>the field lies, with an eye toward ALMA, the next generation world-wide
>submillimeter facility.
>
>1. Conference Organization
>
>The conference will consist of three and one-half days of sessions of
>Invited Talks (30 minutes) and Contributed Talks (15 minutes).  As time
>for talks is limited, posters will be an important part of the
>presentation. The tentative topics are: high redshift universe, local
>galaxies, star formation, evolved stars, chemistry, debris disks, solar
>system objects, and instrumentation.
>
>The conference web site contains all the current information and updates:
>  http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/smast05
>You can sign up on the web site to receive future announcements.
>
>There will be no formal proceedings volume, but we plan to make the
>presentations available on the conference website.
>
>
