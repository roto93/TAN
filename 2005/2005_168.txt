Atomic, Molecular, and Solid-State Radiation Processes in the 
Interstellar Medium

Sun Kwok
Institute of Astronomy & Astrophysics, Academia Sinica

The recent development of observing capabilities in the x-ray, UV, 
infrared, and submillimeter parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, 
especially through observations from space, has identified many radiation 
processes not possible in the terrestrial environment.  The low density of 
interstellar space has allowed the emission of photons from metastable 
states of atoms and ions, as well as from unstable molecular species such 
as radicals.  There are also a number of unidentified features that may 
have their origin in nanoparticles.

In this talk, we will present an overview of modern astronomical 
observations from the radio to the x-ray, and discuss the implication 
these observations on physics and chemistry.

  Dear all,

 	This Friday, we will have a colloquium presented by Dr. Je-An Gu
  from Department of Physics at National Taiwan University. Dr. Gu has been
  working on the topic of cosmic evolution. In Friday's talk, he will discuss
  his very recent research about the acceleration of a dust universe.

 	Please mark your calendar and remember to join!

  Regards,

  sheng-yuan

   Speaker : Dr. Je-An Gu (National Taiwan University)
   Title   : Inhomogeneity-Induced Cosmic Acceleration in A Dust Universe
   Time    : 11/18 (Fri) 2:00 PM
   Location: ASIAA Room 716
   Abstract:
             It is the common intuition and consensus that the expansion
             of a universe always slows down if the gravitational force
             provided by the energy sources therein is attractive universally.
             To this consensus we find counter examples for a spherically
             symmetric dust universe described by the Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi
             solution. Thus, the validity of this naive intuition is indeed
             doubtful and the effects of inhomogeneities should be restudied.
             These examples open a new point of view for understanding
             the evolution of our universe.
