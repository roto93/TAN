       Chemistry in Photodissociation Regions

Abstract:  
The interface region between an HII region and a molecular
region consists of an ionization front and a photodissociation
region (PDR), where molecules (H2, CO, and others) are destroyed
by sub-Lyman UV radiation.   The Orion Bright Bar, M17SW, S140,
NGC7023 are well-known photodissociation regions.  Interestingly,
young planetary nebulae likely have photodissociation regions.
Molecular line observations of the young planetary nebula
NGC 7027 indicate the presence of a photodissocation region.
In order to confirm this idea, a chemical model has been
constructed, in which the abundances of 100 molecular species
have been calculated based on about 1000 chemical reactions.
Based on the chemistry simulation,  I will describe the
peculiar chemistry in the PDR of NGC 7027 (and in PDRs in
general).

Subject: CAST 2005 registration and abstract submission

Dear Colleagues,
due to some problems of access to the CAST web site, which have 
been fixed only recently, we decide to extend the deadline of 
the CAST 2005 registration and abstract submission to May 10.
Please visit the CAST web site at http://www.cast.org.tw/ to
register and submit your abstract.
Attached below is the 2nd circular of CAST 2005 (released March 1, 2005)
for your reference.
Thanks in advance for your participation.
Regards,

Second Circular

The 2005 Annual Meeting of the Chinese Astronomical Society (Taiwan)

National Central University, June 3-4 (Friday and Saturday), 2005
-------------------------------------------------------------

The 2005 Annual Meeting of the Chinese Astronomical Society (Taiwan)
will be held in National Central University on June 3-4, 2005. 
Papers in all fields of astronomy and astrophysics are solicited.
This is the annual meeting for astronomers and astrophysicists in Taiwan
to report their research and to exchange their ideas.
 
The two-day annual meeting will include plenary invited talks, parallel
scientific sessions, poster presentation, forum on astronomy education,
and business meetings. We are pleased to announce that two plenary 
invited talks will be given by Prof. Makishima from Tokyo University on
"A new X-ray window to be opened with Astro-E2" and by Prof. Filippenko from
UC Berkeley on "Evidence from Type Ia Supernovae for a Decelerating, then 
Accelerating Universe and Dark Energy". More details will be announced in 
the final circular.

Participants should register on-line at the CAST 2005 web site 
<http://www.cast.org.tw/> by April 30, 2005. 
A registration fee of NTD 500 should be paid on site, upon which the annual 
membership fee can be waived. Abstract submission should also be carried out 
via the meeting web site by April 30, 2005. The Program Committee will 
announce the final program by May 20, 2005.

The Program Committee and the Organizing Committee sincerely 
invite you to participate all these activities. For further details and
more updated information of the Annual Meeting, please visit the society 
web site at <http://www.cast.org.tw/>.
