Title :              Star Formation in the Spitzer GLIMPSE Survey and a
Radiation  Transfer Tool to Analyze the Data
       
Date    :          December 9th, 2005 (Friday)

Place   :        Room 1013, Science Building IV, NCU
 
Abstract
 
I will give a brief overview of some of the unanswered questions in 
star formation, show results from the GLIMPSE survey, discuss a tool 
we've developed to analyze the data, and then determine if we've 
 answered any of the questions yet (some, a little).  GLIMPSE is the 
Galactic Legacy Infrared Midplane Survey Extraordinaire, a legacy 
project on the Spitzer Space Telescope.  GLIMPSE is mapping the 
inner galactic plane, inside a longitude of l=65 on both sides, 
using the IRAC camera at 3.6-8 microns.  GLIMPSE sees further into 
the galaxy and with higher spatial resolution than previous surveys 
at these wavelengths.  We are seeing hundreds of previously unknown 
 star formation regions.
 
To analyze these data we have constructed a large grid of radiative 
transfer models of forming stars (surrounded by disks and envelopes) 
at various evolutionary states.  We use a linear regression fitter 
to find the best model from the grid to fit a given set of data 
(flux vs wavelength).  The fitter is very fast, and can model the 
entire GLIMPSE point source catalog in a few days.
