Hi all,

We are going to have a colloquium this Friday (Oct. 14).

-----------------------------------------------------

Date & Time	: Oct. 14 (Fri.), 14:00 - 15:00
Place:		: ASIAA conference room, R716
Speaker		: Dr. Phan Bao Ngoc (ASIAA)
Topic		: A new benchmark M9.5 dwarf and first detection of
                  magnetic field in a mid-M dwarf.

<< ABSTRACT >>

Nearby stars provide us benchmarks to study stellar physics, especially
for very faint objects such as ultracool and brown dwarfs (BDs).
In the last decade, a significant amount of ultracool and BDs has been  
found by the DENIS
and 2MASS survey. Delfosse et al. (2001) have reported an M9 at 5 pc,
at this distance an L6 was also found by Martin et al. (1999).
Based on the 2MASS survey, Burgasser et al. (2000) have discovered a T5  
dwarf at 10 pc,
and recently Teegarden et al. (2003) have also reported an M6.5 only at  
4 pc.
These ultracool and BDs are very close and therefore much brighter than
more distant objects and clearly easier to observe them.
In this talk, I present the detection of new nearby M9.5 dwarf within  
10 pc. The nearby
object offers us a new benchmark dwarf to study ultracool and BDs.

On the other hand, I also present the first detection of magnetic field  
in a mid-M dwarf
based on the spectropolarimetry obtained with the Espadons/CFHT  
instrument.
The M dwarf close to the transition where the stars become fully  
convective
is very interesting to study the magnetic dynamo in very cool stars.
This will open a new window to study magnetic field in early and mid M  
dwarfs
using the spectropolarimetric technique.

Thank you for your attention,

Naomi
