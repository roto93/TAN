==============================================================================

Dear TAN subscribers,

Thanks to ASIAA's SAs for their help in solving the sendmail problem,
now the TAN account is once again moved back to ASIAA 
(astro@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw).

I am sorry during the temporary relocation, a couple of messages sent
to TAN were missed and were unable to be forwarded in time.  Again,
sorry for the inconvenience it may have caused.


Regards,
Yi-Jehng Kuan
TAN administrator
