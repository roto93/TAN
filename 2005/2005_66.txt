Dear Yi-Jehng,
 
Could you distribute the following message to TAN ?
 
Thanks,

Dear Astronomers in Taiwan,
 

You probably have known that the 2005 Annual Meeting of the Chinese
Astronomical Society (CAST 2005) will be held in National Central University
on 3-4 June 2005.  We would like to show our sincere appreciation for your
participations. There are about 100 participators have been registered on
line and more 40 contributed talks, as well as ~50 posters, from various
areas will be presented during the meeting.  The program of the meeting is
ready, please check  <http://www.cast.org.tw/cas94/>
http://www.cast.org.tw/cas94/ for details.  For the ones miss the change to
register on line but still are interested in the program, you may as well do
it directly during the meeting.

On the other hand, in addition to the talk for the CAST2005, one of our
invited speakers, Prof. Alex Filippenko, will give a talk entitled " Dark
Energy and the Runaway Universe" for the general public on June 2 (Thu)
19:00 at Room 209 Science Building IV, National Central University.  Prof.
Filippenko played as a important role in the breakthrough of the cosmology
in 1998.  It is a great chance to know about the modern cosmology, such as
"dark energy", "cosmic antigravity" etc.  For more information, please check

Subject: [Colloquium] ASIAA Colloquium (06/02 Thu)


  Dear all,

 	This Thursday (06/02), we will have a colloquium presented by
  Dr. Eduardo Martin from IAC, Spain. Dr. Martin is an expert in various
  stellar astrophysics topics, brown dwarfs in particular. On Thursday,
  he will give a review talk on this subject.

  	Please mark your calendar for this SPECIAL schedule and remember
  to join! You can go to "http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/act/colloquium.php"
  for more ASIAA colloquia info.

  Regards,

  ------------------------ ASIAA Colloquium ------------------------
   Speaker : Prof. Eduardo Martin (IAC, Spain)
   Title   : A Decade of Brown Dwarf Discoveries
   Time    : 06/02 (Thu) 2:00 PM
   Location: ASIAA Room 716
   Abstract: Indeed 10 years have passed since the first brown dwarfs
             were discovered (Gl 229B, PPl 15, and Teide 1). These objects
             paved the way for a rapid development of a new subfield in
             astrophysics which has led to finding many new ultracool dwarfs
             in the solar vicinity, and very low-mass objects in star-forming
             regions and open clusters down to a few Jupiter masses. The
             theory of atmospheres and evolution of brown dwarfs has developed
             considerably, and our understanding of brown dwarf formation
             has become a hot matter of debate. Two new spectral classes
             have been proposed to characterize the spectral properties of
             these objects: the L class for dusty dwarfs, and the T class
             for methane dwarfs. I will review the main highlights of these
             discoveries, and the overall properties of brown dwarfs, and
             their relationship to stars and planets. I will conclude
             discussing challenges for future research on brown dwarfs.
