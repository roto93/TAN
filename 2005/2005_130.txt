Dear colleage,

We have decided to change the deadline of the submission of abstract
and registration because of following two reasons;

  (1) new semester in China and Taiwan has just started,
  (2) the annual meeting of the Astronomical Society of Japan is
      coming just after the current deadline (30/Sep/2005).

New deadline for submission of abstract is set to 15 October 2005.

                       First Announcement

      East Asian Young Astronomers Meeting 2006 (EAYAM 2006)
                     Kiyosato, Yamanashi, Japan
                       13-18 February 2006

Dear colleage,

In Nov. 2003, Taiwanese young astronomers organized East Asian Young
Astronomers Meeting 2003 (EAYAM 2003), and it was a great success. In
Oct. 2004, 6th East Asia Meeting for Astronomy (EAMA6) has settled a
working group for EAYAM, and this working group encourages young
astronomers to have EAYAM every 2-3 years so that all the PhD course
students have a chance to attend it at least once during their course.

Here, we are pleased to announce that the East Asian Young Astronomers
Meeting 2006 (hereafter, EAYAM 2006) will be held in Kiyosato,
Yamanashi, Japan from 13-18 Feb. 2006. The main topic of the invited
reviews is ``Comprehensive Understanding of Star Formation and its
Evolution'', and it is mainly divided into following three categories:

  (1) Star Formation and Radio Astronomy,
  (2) Evolution of Stars and Optical / Infrared Astronomy,
  (3) Final Stage of Stellar Evolution and High Energy Astrophysics.

The contributed talks, however, are not limited to these topics.

This meeting is organized by Japanese young astronomers, and invites
young astronomers in four of the EAMA core regions, China, Japan,
Korea and Taiwan. We also certainly welcome contributions from young
astronomers who are originally from one of these regions and are
currently engaged in research activities abroad. The aim of the
meeting is to encourage the interaction among young astronomers of
neighboring regions, and thus, to provide an opportunity for future
international collaborations. All the participants are expected to
give both oral and poster presentation in order to stimulate
discussions and interactions.

The number of participants from each region will be approximately
12. Postdocs and graduate students are encouraged to participate. We
will provide meals and accommodations during the meeting and
transportation between Tokyo and Kiyosato. Due to the limited budget,
we cannot cover your travel expense between your home institute and
Tokyo.

To register and submit an abstract, please visit following website:

The deadline is postponed from the initial date of 30 September
2005. New deadline of the abstract submission is 15 October 2005. If
you have any question on EAYAM 2006, please contact to
<eayam06_info@th.nao.ac.jp>.

This meeting is supported by National Astronomical Observatory of
Japan, RIKEN, Inoue Science Foundation, Foundation for Promotion of
Astronomy, and individual astronomers in Japan.
