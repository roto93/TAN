Subject: [Colloquium] ASIAA Colloquium This Thursday (01/27)


Dear all,

 	This week, we will have a colloquium talk on Thursday presented by
  Prof. Naoki Itoh visiting from Sophia University in Tokyo, Japan. Prof.
  Itoh has been working on various astrophysical topics including neutron
  stars, pulsars on the small scale as well as galaxy clusters on the large
  scale. He is co-organizing the workshop on "SZ and X-Ray Studies of
  Galaxy Clusters" soon to be held in his institute. On Thursday, he will
  give a talk with the following title, "Relativistic Corrections to the
  Sunyaev-Zeldovich Effect for Clusters of Galaxies"

 	Please notice the special time of the talk. Mark your calendar and
  remember to join!

  Regards,

  sheng-yuan
