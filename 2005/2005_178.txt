Title :              Star Formation in the Spitzer GLIMPSE Survey and a
Radiation  Transfer Tool to Analyze the Data
       
Date    :          December 9th, 2005 (Friday)

Time    :         02:00 pm

Place   :        Room 1013, Science Building IV, NCU
 
 
Abstract
 
I will give a brief overview of some of the unanswered questions in 
star formation, show results from the GLIMPSE survey, discuss a tool 
we've developed to analyze the data, and then determine if we've 
 answered any of the questions yet (some, a little).  GLIMPSE is the 
Galactic Legacy Infrared Midplane Survey Extraordinaire, a legacy 
project on the Spitzer Space Telescope.  GLIMPSE is mapping the 
inner galactic plane, inside a longitude of l=65 on both sides, 
using the IRAC camera at 3.6-8 microns.  GLIMPSE sees further into 
the galaxy and with higher spatial resolution than previous surveys 
at these wavelengths.  We are seeing hundreds of previously unknown 
 star formation regions.
 
To analyze these data we have constructed a large grid of radiative 
transfer models of forming stars (surrounded by disks and envelopes) 
at various evolutionary states.  We use a linear regression fitter 
to find the best model from the grid to fit a given set of data 
(flux vs wavelength).  The fitter is very fast, and can model the 
entire GLIMPSE point source catalog in a few days.

Dear colleagues, 

The project PI and science PI of the Pan-STARRS project, Nick Kaiser and
Ken Chambers, are scheduled to visit us from December 19 to 22.  The main
purpose of their visit is to discuss about the planned collaboration, in
particular how the OIR astronomy community can contribute to, and take
advantage of, the unique PS dataset.  On December 22, Thursday, starting
at 10 am, there will be an open session for which the Hawaiian and
Taiwanese groups will present the project status and summarize the results 
of the negotiation/discussion of their visit.  All are welcomed to express 
your concerns and share your thought.  

          ========= Pan-STARRS Presentations ============
           Time: December 22, Thursday, 10 am
           Place: Room 1013 S4, Astronomy Institute, NCU

If you have any questions regarding this event, please contact either 
Wen-Ping Chen (wchen@astro.ncu.edu.tw) or Ms Layla Ho 
(hyho@astro.ncu.edu.tw).

  Dear all,

 	We will have a colloquium talk this Friday presented by Prof. K.L.
  Chan from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. In the talk
  titled "Dynamics of Atmospheres in the Solar System", Prof. Chan will
  discuss the exploration of interesting atmospheric phenomena in our
  solar system.

 	Please mark your calendar and remember to join!

  Regards,

  sheng-yuan

  ------------------------- ASIAA Colloquium -----------------------
   Speaker : Prof. K.L. Chan
             (Hong Kong University of Science and Technology)
   Title   : Dynamics of Atmospheres in the Solar System
   Time    : 12/09 (Fri) 2:00 PM
   Location: ASIAA Room 716
   Abstract:
             Our solar system hosts extreme conditions and a wide variety
             of atmospheric behavior. Exploration of the various atmospheres
             not only enhances our appreciation of the uniqueness and the
             fragility of our Earth's atmosphere, but is also a necessity
             for the preparation of human visits to other planets. I offer
             to accompany the audience through a hopping tour for interesting
             atmospheric phenomena in our solar system, with occasional simple
             explanations.
