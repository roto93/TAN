Dear Colleagues,

You are cordially invited to attend the Joint Colloquium which will be held
on October 1.

The Joint Colloquium Series is organized by the NTU Physics Department,
Center for Condensed Matter Science (CCMS), Leung Center for Cosmology and
Particle Astrophysics (LeCosPA), Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and
Astrophysics (ASIAA), and the Institute of Atomic and Molecular Sciences
(IAMS).

The idea is to have excellent speakers to give inspiring, informative, but
non-technical talks on the frontiers of Sciences.

Enclosed below is the information of the Joint Colloquium on October 1.

Best regards,

Yen-Ting Lin (ASIAA)
Michitoshi Hayashi (CCMS)
Lain-Jong Li (IAMS)
Jiwoo Nam (LeCosPA)
Juinn-Wei Chen (NTU-Phys)

ASIAA/CCMS/IAMS/LeCosPA/NTU-Physics Joint Colloquium

Speaker: Deputy Director and Research Fellow Huang-Hsiung Hsu (=E8=A8=B1=E6=

Topic : Interpreting the Warming

Time  : 10/01 (Tue.) 14:20 - 15:10

Place : Room 104, CCMS-New Physics Building

Abstract:
    Global warming is one of the hottest environmental issues in recent
years, partly because of the observed warming trend since the early
20th century
and repeatedly occurring extreme events such heat waves and record-breaking
rainfall. Many of these phenomena have been attributed to the increasing
anthropogenic greenhouse effect since the Industrial Revolution. The
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in its Fourth Assessment Report
on Climate Change (2007) confirmed that =E2=80=9Cmost of the observed incre=
ase in
global average temperature since the mid-20th century is very likely due to
the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations=E2=80=
=9D and
projected further 1.8-4=C2=BAC warming by the end of the 21st century. On t=
he
other hand, there are continuing arguments and reports against the
attribution of the observed warming and increasing extreme events to the
anthropogenic greenhouse effect. How do we interpret the mixed information?
What are the scientific bases for the IPCC reports? How reliable is the
future climate projection? This talk will briefly summarize my person view
on these issues and the major scientific findings of the IPCC Fifth
Assessment Report scheduled to release on 27 September 2013.

Brief Bio:

Dr. Huang-Hsiung Hsu was an associate professor and professor at the
Department of Atmospheric Sciences, National Taiwan University from 1989 to
2011. He joined the Research Center for Environmental Changes, Academia
Sinica in August 2011. His research interest includes atmospheric general
circulation, Asian monsoon, climate variation and change, and climate
dynamics. He has been leading a 5=E2=80=93year NSC project =E2=80=9CConsort=
ium for Climate
Change Study=E2=80=9D since August 2011 to implement and develop an Earth S=
ystem
Modeling system in Taiwan. He is also a co-PI of the NSC =E2=80=9CTaiwan Cl=
imate
Change Information and Projection=E2=80=9D Project. Dr. Hsu was a lead auth=
or in
the following two NSC reports: Scientific Report on Typhoon Morakot (
