Dear Colleagues,

You are cordially invited to attend the Joint Colloquium which will be held
on October 8.

The Joint Colloquium Series is organized by the NTU Physics Department,
Center for Condensed Matter Science (CCMS), Leung Center for Cosmology and
Particle Astrophysics (LeCosPA), Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and
Astrophysics (ASIAA), and the Institute of Atomic and Molecular Sciences
(IAMS).

The idea is to have excellent speakers to give inspiring, informative, but
non-technical talks on the frontiers of Sciences.

Enclosed below is the information of the Joint Colloquium on October 8.

Best regards,

Yen-Ting Lin (ASIAA)
Michitoshi Hayashi (CCMS)
Lain-Jong Li (IAMS)
Jiwoo Nam (LeCosPA)
Juinn-Wei Chen (NTU-Phys)

ASIAA/CCMS/IAMS/LeCosPA/NTU-Physics Joint Colloquium

Speaker: Prof Gil Holder

        (Dept. of Physics, McGill University)

Topic : The Cosmic Microwave Background in High Definition

Time  : 10/08 (Tue.) 14:20 - 15:10

Place : Room 104, CCMS-New Physics Building

Abstract:
    High resolution studies of the cosmic microwave background provide new
views on neutrinos, dark energy, and cosmological structure formation. This
new information comes through an improved understanding of the primary
fluctuations imprinted in the early universe, as well as through
measurements of the effects of Compton scattering and gravitational lensing
by structure in the late universe. I'll report  results from the South Pole
Telescope, including a recent detection of the characteristic "B-mode"
pattern of polarized fluctuations that is caused by gravitational lensing.

Brief Bio:
    Dr Holder is the Canada Research Chair in Cosmological Astrophysics at
McGill University and a senior fellow in the Cosmology and Gravity program
of the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research. He obtained his PhD from
the University of Chicago and did postdoctoral research at the Institute
for Advanced Study. His research is at the interface of theory and
experiment in measuring large scale structure in the universe, developing
new techniques for cosmology.
