Dear Colleagues,

You are cordially invited to attend the Joint Colloquium which will be held on April 09.
The Joint Colloquium Series is organized by
the NTU Physics Department, Center for Condensed Matter Science (CCMS),
Leung Center for Cosmology and Particle Astrophysics (LeCosPA),
Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA),
and the Institute of Atomic and Molecular Sciences (IAMS).
The idea is to have excellent speakers to give inspiring, informative,
but non-technical talks on the frontiers of Sciences.

Enclosed below is the information of the Joint Colloquium on April 09.

Best regards,

Pisin Chen (LeCosPA)
Ting-Wai Chiu (NTU-Phys)
Michitoshi Hayashi (CCMS)
Lain-Jong Li (IAMS)
Michihiro Takami (ASIAA)

ASIAA/CCMS/IAMS/LeCosPA/NTU-Physics Joint Colloquium
Speaker: Professor  Yi-Wei Liu (¼B©Éºû ±Ð±Â)
        (Physics department of National Tsing Hau University)
Topic : The proton size puzzle(½è¤l¤j¤p¤§Á¼)
Time  : 04/09 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:10
Place : Room 104, CCMS-New Physics Building


Abstract :
    The precision laser spectroscopy of muonic hydrogen shows a large discrepancy with the current experiments and theory. The resulted charge radius of proton is 7 sigmas away from the previous measurement. In this talk, our experiment and the impact of its results will be discussed.

Brief Bio. :
    Yi-Wei Liu received the D.Phil. degree from Oxford University, Oxford, U.K. He is an Associate Professor with National Tsing-Hau University, Hsinchu, Taiwan. His researches are on the testing fundamental physics with precision laser spectroscopy and the ultracold molecule. He joined CREMA collaboration (Charge Radius Experiment with Muonic Atom ) since 2000.

First Announcement of the 4th Fermi Asian Network (FAN) Workshop
http://www.physics.hku.hk/~astro/FAN4/Index.htm
------------------------------
July 8-12, 2013
The University of Hong Kong

We are delighted to announce the 4th Fermi Asian Network (FAN)
workshop. The FAN collaboration consists of high-energy
astrophysicists mainly from Taiwan, Hong Kong and Korea, and we are
aiming to answer some of the major astrophysical problems by using
Fermi data. Over the last two years, we have published a series of
papers with a focus on compact objects. In order to review our effort
and expand our collaboration, we will hold the 4th workshop in Hong
Kong. The core topics of the workshop will cover

* AGN/Galactic Center
* Diffuse gamma-ray sources
* Fermi transients
* Gamma-ray bursts
* Gamma-ray binaries
* Magnetars
* Millisecond pulsars
* Rotation powered pulsars
* Supernova remnants and pulsar wind nebulae
* Unidentified Fermi objects

The emphasis of this workshop will be on both discussions and formal
presentations. We will also hold a mini hand-on training course to
help students and postdoc to analyze Fermi data.

Invited Speakers:
Andrea Belfiore (UCSC)
Roberto Mignani (UCL)
Paul Ray (NRL)  TBD
Paulo Saz Parkinson (UCSC)
Patrick Slane (CfA)
Diego Torres (IEEC-CSIC)

Registration:
Everyone is invited to participate in this workshop. The registration
fee is USD200 and it could be waived upon request. You are encouraged
to make a contributed talk related to the workshop. The registration
deadline is on May 26, 2013. Due to the limited space, priority will
be given to those with contributed talks. Please visit
http://www.physics.hku.hk/~astro/FAN4/Index.htm for registration and
local information.

Please contact  Prof. K.S. Cheng (hrspksc@hku.hk) for any questions
regarding this workshop.

*** Colloquium
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Matteo BarnabÃ¨ (Dark Cosmology Centre)
Topic:        The dark and luminous mass structure of lens galaxies
Time:        4/12 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
Understanding the formation and evolution processes of galaxies
remains among the most important unsolved problems in present-day
astrophysics and cosmology.
A reliable and detailed description of the mass-density profile and
structural properties of galaxies through cosmic time is a much-needed
step forward but â€“ whereas nearby systems have been thoroughly
analyzed â€“ painfully little is known about more distant objects, since
observational limitations make it difficult to employ the traditional
diagnostic tools.
During this talk I will describe a method to overcome these
difficulties based on combining in a self-consistent way the
information obtained from two independent and complementary
techniques: strong gravitational lensing and stellar dynamics. This
provides a robust way to conduct detailed studies of both elliptical
and disk galaxies beyond the local Universe.
I will then detail the results of the application of this method to
the analysis of a sample of 16 lens elliptical galaxies in the
redshift range z = 0.08 - 0.33, for which both HST imaging
observations and two-dimensional kinematic maps (obtained from VLT
VIMOS spectroscopical observations) are available.
I will also illustrate how this approach can be extended to study in
detail the dark and luminous mass structure of lens disk galaxies, and
to put firm constraints on the initial mass function of massive
galaxies.


*** Special Seminar
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Fred K. Y. Lo (NRAO)
Topic:        Mega-maser Cosmology Project
Time:        4/8 (Monday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
Better measurements of H0 - the current expansion rate of the Universe, provide critical independent constraints on dark energy, spatial curvature of the Universe, neutrino physics, and validity of general relativity. The Mega-maser Cosmology Project (MCP) aims to determine the Hubble Constant at high accuracy by measuring the angular-diameter distance to galaxies in the Hubble Flow. The MCP has discovered 9 new mega-maser disks in Sy2 nuclei suitable for distance determination. A geometric distance measurement to a galaxy at 140 Mpc, via micro- arc-second astrometry of its circum-nuclear mega-maser disk, has been demonstrated. The current status of the MCP measurements of Ho, and future prospects, will be described.

The MCP also enables accurate determination of the central black-hole mass in mega-maser galaxies.    The large intrinsic scatter of BH masses in a narrow range of the velocity dispersion in the mega-maser galaxy bulges raise questions about the validity of the well-known M-Ïƒ relation of BH mass and the spherical component of galaxies. The relationship of the thin Keplerian accretion disks delineated by the mega-masers with the obscuring material of the AGN will also be briefly discussed.

Timing permitting, other key projects at the NRAO will be also described.
