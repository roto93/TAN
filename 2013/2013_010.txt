*** Colloquium
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Lucio Piccirillo (University of Manchester)
Topic:        Next generation of CMB B-modes coherent instruments to reach r<0.01
Time:        1/11 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
I will present the status of our research at JBCA concerning the development of ultra low-noise
cryogenic LNAs and a novel interferometer scheme that can be used for CMB B-modes research. 

The majority of cryogenic HEMT amplifiers are usually cooled at physical temperatures of the order of 15 - 20K 
mostly because it is believed that the noise reduction with temperature is negligible with further reduction of the
temperature. We built a test cryostat equipped with our own design 1K fridge to characterise Ka-band amplifiers in the 
range 20K to 1K. We have extensively studied an MIC Planck EBB, a Faraday MMIC and a novel Transistor + MMIC amplifier 
all at Ka-band. 

We find that there is space for further improvement in noise performances when a comprehensive optimisation of bias
conditions with physical temperature is performed. In addition to a reduction in noise we observe also
a very interesting reduction in bias power dissipated by the amplifier. The results of our study allow us to
propose a potential scheme for the next generation of CMB B-modes experiments where a very large
number of pixels are needed. I will discuss the design of a ~1,000 horns W-band compact camera that can be
used to realise an interferometer installed in a single cryostat.

Dear Prof. Kuan, 

I should appreciate it if you could advertise the following workshop 
on TAN. 

Thank you very much.

    The Sixth Workshop on Black Hole Magnetospheres 

            March 5 (Tue) - 7 (Thu), 2013 

        National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu 

After the discovery about 40 years ago, black holes are used as 
astrophysical laboratories for studying the physics of general 
relativity and high-energy plasma phenomena.  In this workshop, 
we envisage a program highlighting the most recent results, 
as well as revisiting fundamental arguments of black-hole 
astrophysics.  This workshop has been held in Japan every year, 
and this year, will be held in Taiwan for the first time. 
We expect about 15 participants from Japan; therefore, the 
objective of this workshop is to outline a future coordinated 
program of collaborative work between Taiwan and Japan on the 
physics of compact objects. Everyone is cordially invited. 

Topics: 
- Accretion onto compact objects, 
- Structures of black-hole magnetospheres, 
- General-relativistic effects around a black hole, 
- Radio(VLBI)-imaging of the vicinity of a black hole, 
- Formation, propagation, and acceleration of jets 
- Other topics (e.g., black holes, pulsars, jets, ...) 

Venue and Access: 
  National Center for Theoretical Sciences (NCTS), 
    Lecture Room A (c00, 4F), General Building 3, 
    National Tsing Hua University (NTHU), 
    No. 101, Sec. 2, Kuang-Fu Rd., Hsinchu, Taiwan
