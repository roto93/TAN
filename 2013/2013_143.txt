Topic:        An inventory of hidden dust from extremely red evolved stars
Time:        8/16 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
The injection of metal-rich material from dusty red supergiants (RSGs) and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars drives the chemical evolution of galaxies and the formation of the next generation of stars. It is therefore critical to constrain the dust budget from these evolved objects. Over the past few years, our group has used multi-wavelength information to estimate the total dust injection rate from RSG and AGB stars in the Magellanic Clouds.

As part of our studies, we found that most of the dust (>75%) comes from a small fraction (~5%) of very dusty stars. However, the most evolved of these sources are so obscured by dust that they do not have optical or near-infrared counterparts. These extremely red objects (EROs) are thus only visible at mid-infrared and longer wavelengths. A preliminary analysis of the recently discovered extreme carbon stars in the Large Magellanic cloud (Gruendl et al. 2008) using archival Spitzer data from the SAGE program (Meixner et al. 2006) shows that these sources do indeed have very high dust production rates. The detection of such sources is therefore an important step in the determination of the dust budget.

In this talk, I will summarise our work on the dust budget so far, and present our ongoing inventory of ERO candidates in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, as well as in M33. I will also discuss a possible search for these objects in our own Galaxy.
