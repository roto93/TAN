Dear Prospective,

  Please check the following line for Cycle 2 OT update.

  http://almascience.nao.ac.jp/news/urgent-cycle-2-observing-tool-update-1

Urgent: Cycle 2 Observing Tool Update

Nov 15, 2013

An update to the OT release for Cycle 2 proposal submission will be released on Monday 18 November. A number of bugs have been discovered since the Call for Proposals and a number of these are addressed in the update. The majority of the bugs are relatively minor, but time estimates for polarization and spectral scan projects are affected. All users should download this update. Web Start users will automatically receive the update upon restarting the OT, whilst the tarball release will require a manual download and subsequent installation.

Users who already submitted proposals may wish to retrieve their projects and check the OT time estimates. For the most part, there will be no change to the initial result. If there is a significant change in the time estimate, users have the option of resubmitting their Cycle 2 proposal with comments or a revised observing strategy. An option is also to leave the submitted proposal as is. The new time estimate will automatically be used in the proposal review.

More details of the fixes are given on the OT's Known Issues page.

Best Wishes,
Chin-Fei

Dear All,

  Here is a kind reminder for ALMA-T Mock Proposal submission deadline.

  (see also http://alma.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/proposals_cycle02.php#mock)
  The Taiwan ARC node will hold a mock review of ALMA proposals for =
Cycle 2, as for Cycle 1. In Cycle 1, the over-subscription rate was =
about 6. In Cycle 2, the over-subscription rate may be about the same. =
Thus, only very well-prepared proposals will succeed. Prospective users =
should have their proposals prepared now.

Proposals fail sometimes due to 1) unclear science questions or goals =
and/or poorly designed experimenting methods/approaches, but also often =
due to 2) poor writing or last minute compilation. The purpose of this =
review is to improve the quality of ALMA-T proposals for better success =
rate by enforcing potential users to prepare the proposals early, thus, =
to at least eliminate the last minute writing and to further sharpen the =
science ideas.

  This mock review is mainly targeted at new users, postdocs, and =
students in Taiwan. Nonetheless, all Taiwanese users are welcome to =
submit their proposals.

  The proposal submission deadline is 2013.11.19. Full proposal, =
including scientific and technical justification, figures and tables, is =
required to submit to arcasiaa.sinica.edu.tw in pdf format. Half-cooked =
proposals will benefit little from mock reviewing. Technical assessment =
will be carried out by the Taiwan ARC staff. Scientific review will be =
conducted through paper by a review panel, including Vivien Chen, Naomi =
Hirano, Sheng-Yuan Liu, Satoki Matsushita, Kazushi Sakamoto, and Wei-Hao =
Wang.

Technical and scientific review comments will feedback to the PIs =
through email a week later on 2013.11.26. Face-to-face discussion with =
the ARC staff or review panel members may be considered and arranged. =
PIs can incorporate these comments into proposal revision before "true" =
submission.

Best Wishes,
Chin-Fei

ASIAA/CCMS/IAMS/LeCosPA/NTU-Physics Joint Colloquium

Speaker: John Ellis

              (King's College London)

Topic : Particle Physics after the Discovery of the Higgs Boson

Time  : 11/26 (Tue.) 14:20 - 15:20

Place : Room 104, CCMS-New Physics Building

Abstract:
    The discovery of the Higgs boson by the ATLAS and CMS experiments at
the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, described recently in a colloquium
here by George Hou, opens up new perspectives in particle physics. This
colloquium will describe ideas for possible new physics beyond the Standard
Model, much of it motivated by astrophysics and cosmology, such as dark
matter. This colloquium will also discuss prospects for discovering new
physics with the LHC and other possible future accelerators.

Brief Bio:
    John Ellis currently holds the Clerk Maxwell Professorship of
Theoretical Physics at King's College in London. After obtaining a PhD from
Cambridge University and post-doctoral positions at SLAC and Caltech, from
1973 to 2011 he worked at CERN (Geneva), where he was Theory Division
Leader for six years.
    His research interests focus on the phenomenological aspects of
elementary particle physics and its connections with astrophysics,
cosmology and quantum gravity. Much of his work relates directly to
experiment: interpreting results of searches for new particles and
exploring the physics that could be done with future accelerators. A
proposal he made in 1976 led to the discovery of the gluon in 1979, and he
was one of the first to study how the Higgs boson could be produced and
discovered. He has authored nearly a thousand scientific papers, with over
fifty thousand citations in total. He is currently very active in efforts
to understand the Higgs particle discovered recently at CERN, as well as
its implications for possible new physics such as dark matter. He has long
been an early protagonist of new particle accelerator projects, including
the Large Electron-Positron (LEP), Large Hadron Collider (LHC), Compact
Linear Collider (CLIC) and now future very large circular colliders at
CERN. He is also known for his relentless efforts to promote global
collaboration at CERN.
    John Ellis was awarded the Maxwell Medal (1982) and the Paul Dirac
Prize (2005) by the Institute of Physics. He was elected Fellow of the
Royal Society of London in 1985 and of the Institute of Physics in 1991,
and is an Honorary Fellow of King's College Cambridge and of the Serbian
Physical Society. He has been awarded Honorary Doctorates by the University
of Southampton, Uppsala University, the St Kliment Ohridski University, the
Ukrainian Academy of Sciences and the University of Cape Town.

Title: Planet formation in inhomogeneous protoplanetary disks

Abstract:
One of the most fundamental questions in theories of planet formation
is how planets form out of protoplanetary disks. As shown by many
previous studies, planetary migration, that arises from resonant,
tidal interactions between protoplanets and the natal disks,
jeopardizes the existence of any planetary system around the central
stars. In this talk, I will present all the key results of my recent
work, wherein planet traps - specific sites in protoplanetary disks
at which planets undergoing rapid type I migration are captured -
play a crucial role. We will discuss how disk inhomogeneities, one of
the most general properties of planetary disks, give rise to planet
traps and how planet traps affect the formation and evolution of
planetary systems. Comparisons with a large number of observed
exoplanets enable us to verify our picture of planet formation based
on planet traps.

                Tea/Discussion Time is followed !

> Subject: ALMA Workshop on Long Baseline and Phase Correction

Dear all,

ALMA Cycle 2 Call for Proposal has been announced, and many
Cycle 0 results has started to publish these days.  On the
other hand, ALMA developments are still ongoing actively,
and one of the highly requested development items from
scientific point-of-view is the "long baseline."  To realize
the long baseline observations, understanding the effects of
atmosphere to millimeter and submillimeter wave propagation,
testing the phase correction methods, and characterizing the
instruments are essential.

To enhance the discussion for the "long baseline," we are
going to hold the
  "ALMA Workshop on Long Baseline and Phase Correction"
on Dec.25 (Wed) and 26(Thu) at the headquarter of the
National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ) in Mitaka,
Tokyo.  It is planned to have talks about the long baseline
and phase correction tests done so far using ALMA and other
observatories, atmospheric researches, and characterizations
of various instruments, followed by discussions about coming
longer baseline and phase correction tests and further
developments of instruments for ALMA.  We attached the
current tentative program below (it may subject to change).

This workshop is supported by the ALMA Workshop grant of the
NAOJ Chile Observatory.  The budget is extremely limited, so
we cannot support any travel fee (if you are living in Japan,
please contact about the travel support independently).

Note that this workshop will be held in English.

If you would like to attend the workshop, and/or give a oral
presentation, please submit the following format to
  satoki_at_asiaa.sinica.edu.tw
(please change "_at_" to "@").  We are looking forward to
seeing you at the workshop.
