Dear Colleagues,

You are cordially invited to attend the Joint Colloquium which will be held on April 02.
The Joint Colloquium Series is organized by
the NTU Physics Department, Center for Condensed Matter Science (CCMS),
Leung Center for Cosmology and Particle Astrophysics (LeCosPA),
Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA),
and the Institute of Atomic and Molecular Sciences (IAMS).
The idea is to have excellent speakers to give inspiring, informative,
but non-technical talks on the frontiers of Sciences.

Enclosed below is the information of the Joint Colloquium on April 02.

Best regards,

Pisin Chen (LeCosPA)
Ting-Wai Chiu (NTU-Phys)
Michitoshi Hayashi (CCMS)
Lain-Jong Li (IAMS)
Michihiro Takami (ASIAA)

ASIAA/CCMS/IAMS/LeCosPA/NTU-Physics Joint Colloquium
Speaker: Professor  Toshio Matsumoto
        (Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Academia Sinica)
        (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency)
Topic : A search for the light of the first stars; The enigma of the near-infrared background
Time  : 04/02 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:10
Place : Room 104, CCMS-New Physics Building


Abstract :
    The first stars of the universe have attracted the strong interest of astronomers, as the first stars could re-ionized the universe and must be key objects to delineate the dark age of the universe. It has been thought that the first stars are very massive and luminous, however, it is difficult to detect individual stars even with JWST. To overcome the faintness of individual stars, we have tried to observe the near-infrared background to detect the integrated red-shifted light of the first stars. This is a challenging observation,  since there exist bright foreground and backgrounds, however the space probes, COBE, IRTS, AKARI and Spitzer succeeded in detecting excess sky brightness and fluctuation that can not be explained with known foreground emission  sources. In addition to these results, I will present the recent result of the sounding rocket experiment, CIBER, and its implications for the study of the first stars.


Brief Bio. :
    Dr. Matsumoto has been one of the pioneers for space infrared observations in Japan. After attaining a Ph.D. at Nagoya University, he worked for Nagoya University and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), being involved in a number of observations with rockets, and leading the 1st and 2nd Japanese infrared satellite missions, winning several awards in Japan.
    He is now a professor emeritus at JAXA, and significantly involved in the next Japanese and European infrared mission (SPICA) and a international rocket mission with USA, Japan and Korea (CIBER). Since he retired from the professorship at JAXA in 2005, he has been assisting Korea and Taiwan in the SPICA collaboration.
