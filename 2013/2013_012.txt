Dear Friends and Colleagues,

I have the sad news to report that Prof. C. C. Lin passed away in Beiging
at 5:30 am January 13, 2013.  He leaves behind a wife, Shou-Yin, and daughter,
Lillian, and a profound legacy in applied mathematics, fluid dynamics, and
astrophysics.

As most of you know, Prof. Lin had a major part in the founding
of ASIAA by introducing the concept of an Institute of Astronomy
and Astrophysics at a Convocation of the Academicians of Academia Sinica.
For me, he was a teacher and a mentor who got me into astrophysics
in the first place. He set an example of professionalism, scientific integrity,
and personal responsibility, that shine as lessons for us all.

Many of you know of him only as the inventor of density-wave theory.  But,
in fact, he became a member of the US national Academy of Sciences before he
ever wrote a single paper on density wave theory.  For example, when I first
began as his research student, his main interest was wind-driven ocean
circulation.

His scientific career got off on a good start when he was admitted to Tsinghua
University in 1933 as the candidate with the top entrance examination scores
in all of China. A legend among his classmates (or so my father told me), he
graduated four years later still at the top of his class.  His education was
interrupted by World War II, and he obtained his PhD from Caltech in 1944 under
the guidance of the renowned aerodynamicist Theodore Von Karman, again
achieving the highest marks for Caltech graduate students of that period.  He
solved a problem in hydrodynamic stability that had stumped Werner Heisenberg.
His solution is today the classic example for the transition from laminar to
turbulent flow.  He is often called the "father of applied mathematics," and he
achieved the rank of Institute Professor at MIT in 1966, the highest
professorial position at that institute.
(The other Institute Professors at that time were Norbert Wiener, who invented
the field of cybernetics, Robert Samuelson, the first American to win the Nobel
Prize in Economics, and Noam Chomsky, the distinguished linguist and logician).

He retired from MIT in 1987, but continued to work on scientific problems
that interested him.  In 2002 he returned to Tsinghua University in Beijing
and founded the Zhou Pei-Yuan Center for Applied Mathematics.  Whenever
I saw him during that next decade, he would always excitedly tell me about
his ideas on the important biophysics problem of protein folding.  From
turbulence in pipes, to the global circulation of ocean currents, to the spiral
structure of galaxies, to the folding of proteins, the mind of Professor
C. C. Lin knew no restraints or boundaries.  He was a great scientist and
teacher, and a fine human being.  He will be missed but never forgotten.

With great sadness,


Frank
