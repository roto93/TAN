PHOTOMETRIC REDSHIFTS FOR LARGE SCALE SURVEYS
                                (first announcement)

September 3-5, 2013
ASIAA, Taiwan
http://events.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/workshop/20130903

Dear colleagues,

we are pleased to announce that a workshop focused on photometric
redshifts will be held at ASIAA, Taiwan, on September 3-5, 2013. The
aim of this workshop is to gather together world-leading experts
involved in current and future large scale surveys (HSC, Pan-STARRs,
DES, KIDS, PAU, J-PAS, LSST, Euclid, etc.) to discuss solutions for photo-z
estimation techniques suitable for lensing, galaxy and AGN sciences;
taking into consideration the challenges of having these solutions
implemented for large amount of data and in a database environment.

We invite interested people to register through the website
(in "Registration") by June 15th, 2013. However, due to the nature
of the workshop and space limitation, the number of participants
will be restricted to approximately 30 people. Confirmation of
participation will be sent by email before June 30th.

We particularly encourage participation from the Taiwanese community.
For members of the HSC consortium, we will have an extra session on
the morning of Friday 6th dedicated to HSC survey.

If you have any questions feel free to contact us.

Best wishes
Jean Coupon, Sebastien Foucaud and Keiichi Umetsu
