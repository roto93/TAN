********************** Second Announcement *******************************

    The Life Cycle of Dust in the Universe:
    Observations, Theory, and Laboratory Experiments

    November 18-22, 2013, Taipei, Taiwan

    http://events.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/meeting/20131118/

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT NOTICE FOR PARTICIPANTS FROM CHINA:

Participants from the PRC interested in participating in the meeting,
should note that it takes 3 to 4 months in total to apply for a travel
permit. Please contact the LOC before July 18, 2013 at
lcod2013@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

OBJECTIVES:

This meeting aims to address the life cycle of dust in the Universe,
which covers the formation, evolution and destruction of dust in a
range of environments, ranging from the smallest to the largest
scales. Bringing together observational and theoretical
astrophysicists as well as meteoriticists and experimentalists will
allow for a cross-disciplinary dialogue.

The meeting follows a successful tradition of astrophysical dust
meetings, starting in Albany in 1972, with the latest edition "Cosmic
Dust: Near and Far" organized by Th. Henning taking place in
Heidelberg in 2008.

Since that meeting, the field of dust astrophysics has made major
leaps forward with the hoist of data arriving from such missions as
the infrared space telescopes Spitzer, Herschel, and Stardust, the
latter returning dust samples from comet Wild-2 currently being
studied in the lab. The largest telescope on Earth, ALMA, has recently
come online, allowing for investigations into the origin of dust in
the Universe. Thus, this is an excellent time to review the status of
the field of dust astrophysics in this meeting.

The meeting aims to create an environment in which all aspects of the
life cycle of dust will be discussed, from an astrophysical, chemical
and mineralogical perspective, and the effect on a range of
environments. Observational insights, theoretical models and
experimental approaches all contribute to our view of the life cycle
of dust, and the meeting will address new developments and future
projects in all these areas.

VENUE:

International Conference Hall,
Humanities and Social Sciences Building, 3F, Academia Sinica
128 Academia Road, Section 2, Nankang, Taipei, Taiwan

The meeting is held on the Academis Sinica (AS) main campus, which is
different from the National Taiwan University (NTU) campus where
Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Academia Sinica (ASIAA) is
located.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROCEEDINGS:

We plan to publish conference proceedings.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

EXCURSIONS:

Through a local tour agency, we will offer two excursions, which can
be booked separately from the conference registration.

On Wednesday afternoon (20 November), we will visit the famous eroded
coast of Yeliu with its beautiful rock formations, followed by a visit
to the night market of Keelung.

On the weekend after the conference (23 & 24 November), a two-day trip
to Taroko Gorge will be offered. This scenic canyon on Taiwan's east
coast is definitely worth a visit!

The registration for these excursions will open around 1 August, and close
by the end of September. More information will appear on the conference
website in due course.

ISOTOPE WORKSHOP & NANOSIMS INAUGURATION:

After the conference on "The Life Cycle of Dust in the Universe:
Observations, Theory and Laboratory Experiments", there will be a
2-day workshop at Academia Sinica on 25 and 26 November 2013 in honour
of Typhoon Lee's 65th birthday, celebrating his contributions to the
field of meteoritics and dust astrophysics. This will also be the
inauguration meeting for Academia Sinica's NanoSIMS facility.
