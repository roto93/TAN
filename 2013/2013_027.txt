Dear all,

The Asia-Pacific Radio Science Conference (AP-RASC) will be held in the
Howard International House in Taipei from September 3 to 7 this year.
The AP-RASC is the Asia-Pacific regional URSI (International Union of Radio
Science) conference held between the URSI General Assemblies and Scientific
Symposia. The objective of the AP-RASC is to review current research trends,
present new discoveries, and make plans for future research and special
projects in all areas of radio science, especially where international
cooperation is desirable, and a particular emphasis is placed on promoting
various research activities in the Asia-Pacific area.

Scientific sessions composed of oral and poster papers will be organized at
this conference in order to cover all scientific activities by URSI

D. Electronics and Photonics
E. Electromagnetic Environment and Interference
F. Wave Propagation and Remote Sensing
G. Ionospheric Radio and Propagation
H. Waves in Plasmas
J. Radio Astronomy 
K. Electromagnetics in Biology and Medicine
