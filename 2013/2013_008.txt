    The Sixth Workshop on Black Hole Magnetospheres 

            March 5 (Tue) - 7 (Thu), 2013 

        National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu 

After the discovery about 40 years ago, black holes are used as 
astrophysical laboratories for studying the physics of general 
relativity and high-energy plasma phenomena.  In this workshop, 
we envisage a program highlighting the most recent results, 
as well as revisiting fundamental arguments of black-hole 
astrophysics.  This workshop has been held in Japan every year, 
and this year, will be held in Taiwan for the first time. 
We expect about 15 participants from Japan; therefore, the 
objective of this workshop is to outline a future coordinated 
program of collaborative work between Taiwan and Japan on the 
physics of compact objects. Everyone is cordially invited. 

Topics: 
- Accretion onto compact objects, 
- Structures of black-hole magnetospheres, 
- General-relativistic effects around a black hole, 
- Radio(VLBI)-imaging of the vicinity of a black hole, 
- Formation, propagation, and acceleration of jets 
- Other topics (e.g., black holes, pulsars, jets, ...) 

Venue and Access: 
  National Center for Theoretical Sciences (NCTS), 
    Lecture Room A (c00, 4F), General Building 3, 
    National Tsing Hua University (NTHU), 
    No. 101, Sec. 2, Kuang-Fu Rd., Hsinchu, Taiwan
