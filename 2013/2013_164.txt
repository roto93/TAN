Speaker:    Albert Bosma (Laboratoire d'Astrophysique de Marseille)
Topic:        Recent results from the Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies
Time:        10/1 (Tuesday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1108
Abstract:
The S4G survey is an imaging survey of 2331 nearby galaxies using 
the Spitzer telescope at 3.6 and 4.5 $\mu$m. At these wavelengths
the dominant contribution to the stellar light comes from red giant
stars, but there is still light from several younger stellar 
components, as well as radiation from dust. I will give an overview
of the project, and describe first results in several areas. These
include studies of thin and thick disks of spiral galaxies, where
we find evidence for a more important contribution of the thick
disk in galaxies with small rotational velocities, disk truncation
studies (both in the thin disk and in the thick disk), and studies
of galaxies showing various signs of interactions. I will also 
discuss the possibility of creating stellar mass maps from the 
Spitzer data alone. Such maps are in principle useful for calculating
non-axisymmetric potentials, and permit, if realistic, more detailed
modelling of disk galaxies.
