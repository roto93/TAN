> Subject: ALMA Workshop on Long Baseline and Phase Correction

Dear all,

ALMA Cycle 2 Call for Proposal has been announced, and many
Cycle 0 results has started to publish these days.  On the
other hand, ALMA developments are still ongoing actively,
and one of the highly requested development items from
scientific point-of-view is the "long baseline."  To realize
the long baseline observations, understanding the effects of
atmosphere to millimeter and submillimeter wave propagation,
testing the phase correction methods, and characterizing the
instruments are essential.

To enhance the discussion for the "long baseline," we are
going to hold the
  "ALMA Workshop on Long Baseline and Phase Correction"
on Dec.25 (Wed) and 26(Thu) at the headquarter of the
National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ) in Mitaka,
Tokyo.  It is planned to have talks about the long baseline
and phase correction tests done so far using ALMA and other
observatories, atmospheric researches, and characterizations
of various instruments, followed by discussions about coming
longer baseline and phase correction tests and further
developments of instruments for ALMA.  We attached the
current tentative program below (it may subject to change).

This workshop is supported by the ALMA Workshop grant of the
NAOJ Chile Observatory.  The budget is extremely limited, so
we cannot support any travel fee (if you are living in Japan,
please contact about the travel support independently).

Note that this workshop will be held in English.

If you would like to attend the workshop, and/or give a oral
presentation, please submit the following format to
  satoki_at_asiaa.sinica.edu.tw
(please change "_at_" to "@").  We are looking forward to
seeing you at the workshop.
