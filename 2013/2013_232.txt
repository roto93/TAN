Title: Herschel Observations of Molecular Oxygen in Orion

Abstract:
The Herschel Oxygen Project (HOP) is an Open Time Key Project using the 
HIFI instrument on board the Herschel Space Observatory to carry out a 
survey with three rotational transitions of O2 toward a broad sample of 
dense clouds.

I will discuss the HOP observations to date, focusing on the detection of 
O2 toward Orion.I will report new results from observations toward Peak A 
in Orion, a relatively hot, dense region likely including an embedded 
protostar ~20" away from H2 Peak 1. By comparing the line intensities 
toward the two observed positions, I will discuss the implications of the 
source of emission and oxygen chemistry.

  A Discussion Time/Year-End Party is followed !

                  All Welcome !!
