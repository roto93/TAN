Lulin One-meter Telescope (LOT) Call for Observing Proposals for 2013B 



Proposal Deadline 23:59 June 30 2013


The Lulin One-meter Telescope (LOT) solicits observing proposals for the 
semester of 2013B.  The new semester begins on 1 August 2013 and ends 
on 31 January 2014. 

As Prof. Ko (Director, Lulin Observatory) have announced (see #1), we
are going to charge a fee for telescope use.  However, faculty members
of IANCU will donate the fee in the 2013B semester for your
observation(s). Therefore, most of you will not be asked to cover the
cost. As usual, collaboration with NCU faculty is encouraged.

The new proposal LaTex package are available at 
  http://eafon.astro.ncu.edu.tw/lulinprop/lotprop2013b.tar.gz
The completed proposal should contain the filled and compiled version
of the LaTex file (in PDF or PS format), plus up to two PDF pages of
scientific justification including figures, tables, and references.
The proposal (cover form and 2-page of scientific case) should be
submitted to the following email address:
  lottac@eafon.astro.ncu.edu.tw 
with a copy to me to avoid occasional erroneous delivery: 
  urata@astro.ncu.edu.tw 

Please note that in addition to research proposals, we also accept
educational programs for astronomical observation courses. 

The Observatory management pays particular attention to the scientific
products by our facilities. So if you have used the LOT before, please
fill in the status of the data, and any publications as results of any
LOT data.  The publication list is summarized at
http://lulin.ncu.edu.tw/Research/index.htm

If you have any updates from your previous observations, please list
up the complete list.  If no information is forthcoming, the TAC will
assume that no progress has been made and will take this into
consideration in allocation of observing time.  If your program is
continuous one, please do NOT forget to mention about the status of
the project and publication plans.

As usual, there will be three instruments available, the Lulin CCD
Imager (LCI), the Lulin Compact Spectrograph (LCS), and TRIPOL, a
simultaneous tricolor (g', r', i') imaging polarimeter.  At the time
of this announcement, TRIPOL is being shaked down and characterized.
Those who are interested in the specs of any of these instrument
should contact Prof. Wen Ping Chen.  You can follow this url to get
information regarding the telescope and instruments,
  http://www.lulin.ncu.edu.tw/lot/

To ensure the capabilities of LOT and instruments, you can also refer
the previous publications with LOT listed in the above url.

If you have any questions or problems regqarding the preparation of the
proposals, please contact

Instrumentation/Telescope/Instrumentation queries Mr. Hunag-Chin Lin
Scientific queries Yuji Urata

Time allocation will be announced by mid-July, 2013.


Regards, 


Yuji Urata

Subject: TELESCOPE FEES ANNOUNCEMENT
Date:     2012年11月19日 11:36:30 GMT+08:00
Dear LOT users and friends of Lulin,


Attn: TELESCOPE FEES ANNOUNCEMENT

I would like to take this opportunity to thank all our users of LOT
(and others facilities at Lulin) for the approval of our services.
However, due to the financial difficulties, we are no longer able to
support the facilities at Lulin Observatory by our institute alone.
Thus we would like call on our friends and users of Lulin to
contribute and support the maintenance cost of the observatory.

After some considerations, we come up with a plan.  Starting from the
semester 2013B, we are going to charge a fee for telescope use.  Lulin
1-m Telescope (LOT) will be charged for "Observing Time".  The rate
will be "NTD 1000 per observing hour".  "Observing" is defined as when
the dome and shutter are open for scientific data (observation log
will be taken as reference when necessary).

If you have applied or is going to apply for funding from NSC, please
read on.  We have discussed with NSC about our intention.  They agreed
that "telescope using fees" can be included in NSC proposals.  If you
are applying for a new NSC proposal (by the end of this year), please
don't forget to put your request (e.g., how many hours observing time)
into your new proposal.  If you are working on a multi-year NSC
project, please add this item into the funding request next May (along
with your mid-term report).

Once again, thank you for using our facilities. 
Your continuous support is vital to the quality of the observatory.


best wishes,
Chung-Ming Ko (Director, Lulin Observatory).

Topic:        The origin of wide binary star companions and wide planetary orbits
Time:        6/20 (Thursday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
Observations have revealed the presence of a significant population of wide (> 1000 AU) binary systems in the Galactic field and halo. In addition, planets in wide (> 100 AU) orbits have been detected. The origin of both of these populations is difficult to explain with theories of star formation and planet formation. We carry out N-body simulations of dissolving star clusters with a free-floating planet population, and show that dynamical capture processes can explain these wide orbits. Interestingly, the simulations also predict the existence of other peculiar systems, such as higher-order multiple systems, circumbinary planets, planets around black holes and white dwarfs, retrograde planetary orbits, and free-floating double planets.

        Title: Search for Surviving Post-Impact Remnant Stars

        Abstract:
The nature of the progenitor systems of Type Ia supernovae is still
unclear. One way to distinguish between the SDS and DDS is to search
for the surviving Post-Impact Remnant Stars (PIRSs). Using our
stellar evolution simulations of main-sequence- (MS-) and
helium-rich- (He-) PIRSs, we predict the color and magnitude of MS-
and He-PIRSs as functions of time. We also discuss PIRS candidates in
Galactic Type Ia supernova remnants (Ia SNRs), including SN 185, SN
1006, SN 1574, SN 1604, and G1.9+0.3, and nearby extragalactic Ia SNRs

Tea/Discussion Time is followed in the same room.
