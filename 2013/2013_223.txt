*** Colloquium
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Ralph Pudritz (Origins Institute, and Dept. of Physics and Astronomy, McMaster University.)
Topic:        The early evolution of disks, jets, and protostellar spins
Time:        12/4 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
The formation of disks and outflows as a consequence of 
the collapse of dense, magnetized, molecular cloud cores is a central
problem in star formation.  Collapse in a magnetized medium holds a major
surprise in that magnetic braking by an ordered field can strongly 
surpress disk formation.  A related question is why the 
spin rates of many young stars are so low despite their
high accretion rates.  How is the angular momentum problem of young
stars resolved?  This talk traces the early evolution of collapsing magnetized
cores through the formation of disks, outflows, and accretion-powered
stellar winds means by which the angular momentum problem of star formation 
is resolved.

Dear Colleagues,

You are cordially invited to attend the Joint Colloquium which will be held
on December 10 (http://web.phys.ntu.edu.tw/colloquium/).

The Joint Colloquium Series is organized by the NTU Physics Department,
Center for Condensed Matter Science (CCMS), Leung Center for Cosmology and
Particle Astrophysics (LeCosPA), Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and
Astrophysics (ASIAA), and the Institute of Atomic and Molecular Sciences
(IAMS).

The idea is to have excellent speakers to give inspiring, informative, but
non-technical talks on the frontiers of Sciences.

Enclosed below is the information of the Joint Colloquium on December 10.

Best regards,

Yen-Ting Lin (ASIAA)
Michitoshi Hayashi (CCMS)
Chia-Lung Hsieh (IAMS)
Jiwoo Nam (LeCosPA)
Juinn-Wei Chen (NTU-Phys)

ASIAA/CCMS/IAMS/LeCosPA/NTU-Physics Joint Colloquium

Speaker: Cheng Chin

              (University of Chicago)

Topic :  *From Cosmology to Cold Atoms: **Observation of Sakharov Acoustic
Oscillations **in Quenched Atomic Superfluids*

Time  : 12/10 (Tue.) 14:20 - 15:20

Place : Room 104, CCMS-New Physics Building

Abstract:
    Sakharov acoustic oscillation, conventionally discussed in the context
of early universe evolution and the anisotropy of cosmic microwave
background radiation, is the manifestation of interfering acoustic waves
generated in an ideal fluid. We report a laboratory simulation of Sakharov
oscillations in an atomic superfluid by quenching the interactions between
atoms and monitoring the subsequent density fluctuations. Sakharov
oscillations are identified as the multi-peak structure in the density
fluctuations, resembling that of the cosmic microwave background radiation.
From the Sakharov oscillations, we determine the sonic horizon, providing
new perspectives to extend quantum simulation to other intriguing
cosmological and gravitational phenomena.

Brief Bio:
    Cheng Chin is a professor at the James Franck Institute, Enrico Fermi
Institute, and the Department of Physics at the University of Chicago. He
received his Ph.D. from Stanford University and completed his postdoc
research at Innsbruck University in Austria. He conducts experimental
research on ultracold atoms. He has received the Sloan Fellowship (2006),
Packard Fellowship (2006), OCPA Young Research Award (2006), NSF CAREER
Award (2008), IUPAP Young Scientists Prize (2008), I. I. Rabi Prize (2011)
and Humboldt Fellowship (2013).

            Astronomy Colloquium
############################################

      2:20 p.m. 13 Dec. 2013 (Friday)
      NTHU Physics Building, Rm620

      Speaker: Prof. Ralph Pudritz
              (McMaster University, Canada)

      Title: From Clouds to Star Clusters:
            Origins of the IMF


      Abstract:
My talk will review physical processes leading from the
physics of molecular clouds to the origin of the mass
distribution of molecular cloud cores - the "Core Mass
Function" (CMF) - the birth sites of young stars.
The second step is to consider the effects of feedback
processes that lead from the CMF to the IMF.

      Tea/Discussion Time is followed !

                All Welcome !!

*** Special Seminar
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Yoshihide Kozai (NAOJ)
Topic:        So-called Kozai Mechanism
Time:        12/9 (Monday) 13:30 - 14:30
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
The so-called Kozai mechanism was formulated to understand the secular perturbations
of asteroids with arbitrary eccentricity and inclination. And some dynamical difference between
asteroids and comets did show up by this theory.
As the potential field is that of axial symmetry, the results can be applied to any case in the
same type of the potential field.  In this talk I will show some examples which can be allied by this
mechanism as well as some not to be applied by this.
