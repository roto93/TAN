Abstract :
    The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer, AMS, is a general purpose particle physics detector in space. It was installed on the International Space Station on 19 May, 2011. The first AMS result is based on 25 billion cosmic ray events collected during the first 18 months of operation. A precision measurement of the positron fraction in primary cosmic rays in the range from 0.5 to 350 GeV is presented. The spectrum shows a steady increase of the positron ratio from 10 to ~250 GeV, with no observable structure or anisotropy.
    This talk will introduce the AMS detector and its operation in space, followed by details of the analysis towards the positron ratio measurement. Some implications of these new results are also discussed.

********************** First announcement *******************************

    The Life Cycle of Dust in the Universe:
    Observations, Theory, and Laboratory Experiments

    November 18-22, 2013, Taipei, Taiwan


-------------------------------------------------------------------------

OBJECTIVES:

This meeting aims to address the life cycle of dust in the Universe,
which covers the formation, evolution and destruction of dust in a
range of environments, ranging from the smallest to the largest
scales. Bringing together observational and theoretical
astrophysicists as well as meteoriticists and experimentalists will
allow for a cross-disciplinary dialogue.

The meeting follows a successful tradition of astrophysical dust
meetings, starting in Albany in 1972, with the latest edition "Cosmic
Dust: Near and Far" organized by Th. Henning taking place in
Heidelberg in 2008.

Since that meeting, the field of dust astrophysics has made major
leaps forward with the hoist of data arriving from such missions as
the infrared space telescopes Spitzer, Herschel, and Stardust, the
latter returning dust samples from comet Wild-2 currently being
studied in the lab. The largest telescope on Earth, ALMA, has recently
come online, allowing for investigations into the origin of dust in
the Universe. Thus, this is an excellent time to review the status of
the field of dust astrophysics in this meeting.

The meeting aims to create an environment in which all aspects of the
life cycle of dust will be discussed, from an astrophysical, chemical
and mineralogical perspective, and the effect on a range of
environments. Observational insights, theoretical models and
experimental approaches all contribute to our view of the life cycle
of dust, and the meeting will address new developments and future
projects in all these areas.

        Title: Classical Cepheids Beyond Classical Regime
              -- Longer Wavelength, Longer Periods
                  and Larger Projection Factors

        Abstract: In this talk, I will present new directions
        of Cepheid research emerged in recent years.  An
        on-going search of ultra-long period Cepheids (ULPCs)
        in M31 using PTF data is highlighted. Finally, I will
        ended my talk with the recent investigation of
        projection factor (p-factor) -- an important parameter
        when calibrating the PL relation using
        Baade-Wesselink (BW) type technique. The value
        of p-factor was found to be larger than the
        previous adopted, which could have impact on
        the derived Hubble constant via the Cepheid PL
        relations calibrated with BW methods.

  Tea/Discussion Time is followed in the same room.

                  All Welcome !!

____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Yutaro Sekimoto (Advanced Technology Center, National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ))
Topic:        Submillimeter-wave 10 kilo-pixel camera for future radio astronomy
Time:        5/10 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
Submillimeter-wave 10 kilo-pixel camera with wide field-of-view may bring a revolution in research of cosmic microwave background and high-z submillimeter galaxies. We have been developing superconducting "CCD"-like cameras for future radio astronomy after ALMA receiver developments.
ALMA is a powerful instruments with capability of high spatial and spectral resolution, however, the field of view is quite limited to 21 arc second at 300 GHz.
Wide field observation with a large format imaging array isn't only a complementary for ALMA but also suitable for study of large scale structure of the universe.

Microwave kinetic inductance detector (MKID) or superconducting micro-resonator is a promising technology for this purpose because large arrays can be read out using frequency-domain multiplexing with a microwave low-noise amplifier. MKID can detect higher frequencies than the gap frequency of a superconducting material, for example, Aluminum gap frequency of 90 GHz. We have demonstrated a submillimeter 100 pixel camera which consists of Aluminum antenna coupled MKIDs and Si-lens array. The dark noise equivalent power (NEP) was achieved to be 6 x 10^{-18} W/rHz.  Beam pattern of the MKID camera has been measured.

We are developing MKID cameras for two future projects.
LiteBIRD is a future satellite to detect B-mode polarization of cosmic microwave background (CMB) led by KEK, which can explore the cosmological inflation.
It consists of a small (60 cm) crossed Dragone telescope and
a low-noise imaging array to observe CMB with a sensitivity of r (tensol-to-scalar ratio) ~ 0.001 at large angular scales.
To reduce foreground contamination from diffuse galactic plane, it observes 50 - 270 GHz with dual-polarization imaging array.
A 10m-class telescope for terahertz observations is planned by Tsukuba University at
Dome Fuji (Alt. 3800 m) on Antarctica. A wide field-of-view (~1 degree) survey of submillimeter galaxies is planned with a 10 kilo-pixel array detector covering 400 GHz - 1.5 THz.


*** Special Seminar
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Hao-Yi Wu (University of Michigan)
Topic:        Precision cosmology from galaxy clusters and large-scale structures: the role of N-body simulations
Time:        5/7 (Tuesday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
The number counts and large-scale distribution of galaxy clusters are powerful probes of the structure and composition of the universe.  In the era of precision cosmology from deep wide surveys, dark matter N-body simulations play an essential role in modeling the non-linear gravitational effects and interpreting the survey results.  In this talk, I will first discuss what we have learned from these simulations, how much we still need to improve them for upcoming surveys, and what the potential dangerous systematics are.  I will then present the results from my cluster simulation project �hapsody�� �� a statistical sample of high-resolution re-simulated clusters �� which allows us to statistically characterize the distribution of and correlation between cluster properties at fixed mass.  I will focus on how we can use the understanding of the clusters�� formation history to optimize the use of cluster mass tracers, to model the covariances between different mass proxi!
es, and to reduce systematic errors in cluster cosmology.
