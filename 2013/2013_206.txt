Dear Colleagues,

You are cordially invited to attend the Joint Colloquium which will be held
on November 19 (http://web.phys.ntu.edu.tw/colloquium/).

The Joint Colloquium Series is organized by the NTU Physics Department,
Center for Condensed Matter Science (CCMS), Leung Center for Cosmology and
Particle Astrophysics (LeCosPA), Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and
Astrophysics (ASIAA), and the Institute of Atomic and Molecular Sciences
(IAMS).

The idea is to have excellent speakers to give inspiring, informative, but
non-technical talks on the frontiers of Sciences.

Enclosed below is the information of the Joint Colloquium on November 19.

Best regards,

Yen-Ting Lin (ASIAA)
Michitoshi Hayashi (CCMS)
Lain-Jong Li (IAMS)
Jiwoo Nam (LeCosPA)
Juinn-Wei Chen (NTU-Phys)

ASIAA/CCMS/IAMS/LeCosPA/NTU-Physics Joint Colloquium

Speaker: Ignatios Antoniadis

              (CERN)

Topic : The Hidden Dimensions of the Universe

Time  : 11/19 (Tue.) 14:20 - 15:20

Place : Room 104, CCMS-New Physics Building

Abstract:
    Particle physics studies the elementary constituents of matter and
their fundamental forces. Very short distances are explored by particle
collisions at very high energies, creating conditions similar to those
governing the Universe just after the Big Bang. In particular, the recent
discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN,
the most powerful machine of colliding protons around Geneva, confirmed the
remarkable success of the Standard Theory of particle physics and is now
entering into new unexplored territories of physics beyond our current
understanding of Universe.
    Among theoretical proposals, string theory unifies all known physical
theories of fundamental interactions including gravity in a single coherent
framework. Despite naive expectations, there are good reasons to believe
that its ``hidden" dimensions may be much larger than what we thought in
the past and they become within experimental reach in the near future,
together with the strings themselves. In my talk, I will give an elementary
introduction of this idea and describe the main experimental predictions.

ASIAA/CCMS/IAMS/LeCosPA/NTU-Physics Joint Colloquium

Speaker: Eric Isaacs

            (Director, Argonne National Lab)

Topic : Energy Storage Research at Argonne National Laboratory: New
Approaches to Energy Innovation

Time  : 11/19 (Tue.) 15:30 - 16:30

Place : Room 104, CCMS-New Physics Building

Brief Bio:
    Eric D. Isaacs, a prominent University of Chicago physicist, is
President of U Chicago Argonne, LLC, and Director of Argonne National
Laboratory. Before becoming Argonne Director, Isaacs served as Argonne's
deputy laboratory director for programs, with responsibility for leading
the laboratory's strategic planning process and overseeing the
laboratory-directed research and development program as well as its
educational programs.
    Earlier he distinguished himself both as director of the Center for
Nanoscale Materials at Argonne and as professor of physics in the
University of Chicago's James Franck Institute. During his 13-year tenure
at Bell Laboratories, he was a member of the technical staff, director of
the Materials Physics Research Department and director of the Semiconductor
Physics Department.
    He received a Ph.D. degree from the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology in 1988 in the area of magnetic semiconductors and was a
postdoctoral fellow at Bell Laboratories (1988-1990) studying magnetism and
correlated electronic systems, mostly with synchrotron-based X-ray
techniques.
    He is a fellow of the American Physical Society and served on a number
of national scientific advisory committees, including the Basic Energy
Sciences Advisory Committee. He is author or co-author of more than 140
scientific papers and presentations.

Abstract: http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/activity/colloquium.php


*** Special Seminar
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Tsz Yan Lam (MPA)
Topic:        Eulerian-Void Assignment and its application in modified gravity model
Time:        11/19 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
Void would be considered the underdenese analogy of massive halos and would constrain cosmological models. I will first discuss the recent development of a new algorithm to assign Eulerian void in the framework of the excursion set approach. I will then describe its application to modified gravity models, which has a distinctive feature compared to the statistics using massive halos.
