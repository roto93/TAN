Dear Colleagues,

You are cordially invited to attend the Joint Colloquium which will be held
on December 3 (http://web.phys.ntu.edu.tw/colloquium/).

The Joint Colloquium Series is organized by the NTU Physics Department,
Center for Condensed Matter Science (CCMS), Leung Center for Cosmology and
Particle Astrophysics (LeCosPA), Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and
Astrophysics (ASIAA), and the Institute of Atomic and Molecular Sciences
(IAMS).

The idea is to have excellent speakers to give inspiring, informative, but
non-technical talks on the frontiers of Sciences.

Enclosed below is the information of the Joint Colloquium on December 3.

Best regards,

Yen-Ting Lin (ASIAA)
Michitoshi Hayashi (CCMS)
Chia-Lung Hsieh (IAMS)
Jiwoo Nam (LeCosPA)
Juinn-Wei Chen (NTU-Phys)

ASIAA/CCMS/IAMS/LeCosPA/NTU-Physics Joint Colloquium

Speaker: Robert Williams

              (Space Telescope Science Institute)

Topic :  *Hubble Space Telescope: **Piecing Together the Evolution of the
Universe*

Time  : 12/03 (Tue.) 14:20 - 15:20

Place : Room 104, CCMS-New Physics Building

Abstract:
    In orbit for 23 years and still operating well, in planning and
development for 15 years before that, HST---at $7.5 billion---has been the
most expensive scientific project in history until CERN=A1=AFs LHC. It=A1=
=AFs unique
features of high spatial resolution, ultraviolet sensitivity, and low sky
background together with its unified, well calibrated, publicly available
data archive have produced many notable astronomical discoveries.
Highlights of Hubble Telescope=A1=AFs scientific mission will be discussed =
in
the context of processes that have been key to our current understanding of
the evolution of the universe from the earliest times to the present epoch.
These include gravitational lensing, the Hubble deep fields which have
revealed early galaxy formation, galaxy mergers that form black holes, and
the initial attempts of analysis of the atmospheres of planets around other
stars.

Brief Bio:
    Dr. Robert Williams is Distinguished Research Scholar at the Space
Telescope Science Institute (STScI) in Baltimore, after having served as
Director of the Institute from 1993 to 1998. The STScI operates the Hubble
Space Telescope for NASA. Prior to this position, Dr. Williams was
Professor of Astronomy at the University of Arizona for 18 years, and was
Director of the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile for 8
years. Dr. Williams' research specialties are nebulae, novae, and
emission=A9\line spectroscopy and analysis. He was also President of the
International Astronomical Union, and is adjunct professor at Johns Hopkins
University.
    During his tenure as the STScI Director, he devoted his director's
discretionary time of the Hubble Space Telescope to image an ordinary patch
of the sky, which came to be known as the Hubble Deep Field (HDF). The HDF
data had profound impact in extragalactic studies, in that it allowed
astronomers to peek to the dawn of galaxy formation, and it promoted large
scale collaborations of the community to gather data together. For his
leadership in the HDF project, he was awarded the Beatrice Tinsley Prize in
1998, and the NASA Distinguished Public Service Medal in 1999.
