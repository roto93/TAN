*** Special Seminar
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Kenneth Wong (University of Arizona)
Topic:        Optimal Mass Configurations for Lensing High-Redshift Galaxies (and How to Find Them In the SDSS!)
Time:        1/24 (Thursday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
We investigate whether lines of sight containing multiple cluster-scale halos are the best cosmic telescopes for lensing high-redshift (z~10) sources into detectability.  For lines of sight of fixed angular size and total mass, we test how the lensing cross section and the number of faint galaxies detected at high redshift change as that mass is distributed among multiple halos, as well as which physical properties of the halos are most important.  We find that multiple projected halos are can result in improvement in the detection of faint, high-z sources compared to single halos of equivalent total mass due to the interactions among the lensing potentials when the projected halos overlap.  Using integrated LRG luminosity density as a tracer of mass, we have identified lines of sight in the SDSS that are likely to contain the largest total integrated masses.  These fields contain a diversity of single massive clusters and chance alignments of multiple halos in projection, a!
nd are likely to be among the best gravitational lenses known.  Our ongoing galaxy spectroscopy in the first of these fields reveals the presence of large total masses (> 3 x 10^15 M_sun) along the line of sight and multiple cluster-scale structures.
