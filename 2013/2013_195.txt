*** Colloquium
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Chris Lintott (University of Oxford)
Topic:        The shape of galaxy evolution - Morphology in the age of Galaxy Zoo
Time:        10/30 (Wednesday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
Despite the advent of large surveys, morphology remains an important diagnostic for studies of galaxy evolution and formation. Since 2007, the Galaxy Zoo project (http://www.galaxyzoo.org) has collected more than 250 million independent classifications of galaxies from both the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and large Hubble Space Telescope surveys, and in this seminar project Principle Investigator Chris Lintott will review the results, emphasizing the use of morphology to distinguish between secular and merger-driven evolution. Unusual objects discovered by Galaxy Zoo such as Hanny's Voorwerp, a quasar light-echo, have also provided a chance to study the evolution of AGN almost as it happens.

Speaker:    Geoffrey Bower (UC Berkeley)
Topic:        The Onset of Molecular Gas:  CO Intensity Mapping
Time:        10/29 (Tuesday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
Molecular gas is a poorly understood but vital component of galaxy evolution.  New tools such as ALMA and EVLA are making impressive characterizations of the gas in the most massive galaxies at high redshift.  But lower mass galaxies, which ultimately evolve into galaxies like the Milky Way, are undetectable through individual pointings.  Intensity mapping, or the detection of aggregate emission of large angular scales, is a powerful tool for characterizing the molecular gas in low mass galaxies.  I will describe our campaign using data from the SZA to detect CO at z=3 and our plans to detect molecular gas to greater redshift using the SZA, AMiBA, and new instruments.

Topic : Interesting Properties of Strained and Defective Graphene

Time  : 11/05 (Tue.) 14:20 - 15:20

Place : Room 104, CCMS-New Physics Building

Abstract:
    Most people think of graphene as a flat membrane and the quality of
physics observation depends on the flatness of it. However defective or
strained graphene can present interesting properties, especially to a
chemist. For example, generating pores or voids in graphene, oxidizing and
disrupting the conjugation, as in the case of nanoporous graphene oxide,
can generate a material that is catalytically active =A8C what the chemists
called =A1=B0carbocatalyst=A1=B1. Nanoporous graphene oxide can mediate a w=
ide range
of chemical transformation. We have managed to identify a simple chemical
treatment to introduce porosity and tune the acidity of Graphene Oxide
(GO). This is a potentially important area for industrial applications. The
GO catalyst can be used in oxidative coupling reactions as well as tandem
catalytic reactions.
    Generating strain textures on graphene allows the engineering of new
energy landscape. The Dirac electrons in graphene couples to strain via
pseudomagnetic field, creating an electrodynamics that is controlled by the
geometry of the strain. Using the graphene Moir=A8=A6 superlattice,
geometrically precise nanobubbles can be generated that show pseudomagnetic
field in the hundreds of Telsa. We discuss the chemistry of how such strain
texture can be created by controlling sub-surface defects on the metal
substrate. Nanobubbles on graphene can also be created when graphene is
transferred onto diamond. Very robust interfacial bonding between diamond
and graphene allows a hydrothermal anvil to be created at the interface.
Superheated water trapped at the interface becomes corrosive at high
temperature and pressure and can etch diamond [3]. By monitoring the
conformational changes of pressure-sensitive molecules , the pressure
within the nanobubble could be tracked as a function of temperature and was
found to be at ~1 GPa at 600 deg C. The polymerization of
buckminsterfullerene(C60), which is symmetrically forbidden under ambient
conditions, was observed to proceed in well-defined stages in the
pressurized nanobubbles.

Second Circular: Quasar science with HSC: toward the first results


==============================
14-16 January 2014
Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Academia Sinica (ASIAA),
Taipei, Taiwan
http://astro.edu.nagasaki-u.ac.jp/HSC-AGN2014/
http://events.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/meeting/20140114/
==============================


The formation and evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are
among the most exciting and challenging topics in astronomy and
astrophysics. New wide-field deep surveys are required to tackle
these issues, and Subaru's new wide-field camera (Hyper Suprime-Cam;
HSC) will bring promising opportunities to make breakthroughs in
this research field. Since the HSC-SSP (Subaru Strategic Program)
survey will start soon (in Spring 2014), it is a good time to have
an intensive face-to-face discussion among HSC collaboration
astronomers about scientific opportunities from the first-year data.

We will focus on doing science and writing papers based on the
first-year data of the coming HSC-SSP survey. These discussions in
advance of the start of the HSC-SSP survey will maximize the
scientific output in the theme of SMBH studies.

We will focus on the following topics, among others:
  -- Current status of the HSC operation plans, camera, and pipeline
  -- Commissioning run results and the data
  -- Survey plans and output photometric catalogs
  -- Quasar selection methods
  -- AGN photometric redshifts
  -- Statistics of quasars and SMBHs from the HSC data
  -- Co-evolution studies of SMBHs and galaxies with the HSC data
  -- Synergies of HSC and multi-wavelength data for SMBH studies
  -- Strategies for spectroscopic follow-up and the relation with PFS
  -- Theoretical preparations for HSC quasar surveys
  -- Action items for the HSC-SSP survey

The meeting will take place at Academia Sinica, Institute of Astronomy
and Astrophysics (ASIAA). The institute is located in the city of
Taipei, the capital of Taiwan, on the grounds of National Taiwan
University (*not* in the Academia Sinica Campus near Nan-Kang). The
weather in Taipei is typically fine and warm in January, and visitors
can enjoy nearby night markets (the nearest one is within walking
distance), historical places within the city, excellent museums, one
of the tallest skyscrapers in the world, and superb cuisine, all
accessible with a very convenient subway system.

The webform for the on-line registration and the abstract submission
is now open at the following URL (deadline: 30th November 2013):
http://events.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/meeting/20140114/

Note that there is no registration fee for participating in this
workshop. Participants from outside of Taipei may stay at the Howard
Hotel, which is located walking distance from ASIAA. Please indicate
your check-in and check-out dates on the registration webform by the
registration deadline, if you decide to stay in Howard Hotel, and
the meeting organizers will make your reservation for you. Please
DO NOT reserve your room(s) yourself.
Though the total available budget is limited, we will be able to

OBJECTIVES:
This series of Cosmic Dust meetings aims at finding a consensus among 
experts on the formation and evolution of cosmic dust: where it comes 
from and where it goes. The meeting is organized by dust freaks who are 
very enthusiastic not only to make the goal achievable but also to 
establish a dust community across every scientifically relevant 
discipline for the development of cosmic dust research. For this reason, 
the primary objectives of the meeting are to bring together 
professionals who deal with cosmic dust and to provide an opportunity 
for participants to develop human relations and interactions among the 
participants.

SCOPE:
All kinds of cosmic dust such as
• intergalactic dust
• circumnuclear dust
• interstellar dust
• protoplanetary disk dust
• debris disk dust
• cometary dust
• interplanetary dust
• circumplanetary dust
• stellar nebular condensates
• presolar grains
• micrometeorites
• meteoroids
• meteors
• regolith particles
• planetary aerosols
are the subject of discussion. The meeting is open for any aspects of 
dust research by means of different methods of studies (in-situ and 
laboratory measurements, astronomical observations, laboratory and 
numerical simulations, theoretical modeling, data analyses, etc.). All 
dust-related topics, for example, the formation of molecules and their 
reactions on and their desorption from the surface of dust particles, 
are also welcome. Publishing the proceedings of this meeting is 
currently being planned as a special issue of a peer-reviewed journal, 
while paper submission to the proceedings is not obligatory.

BRIEF HISTORY:
The Cosmic Dust meeting started in 2006 as a session called “Cosmic 
Dust” of the 3rd AOGS (Asia-Oceania Geoscience Society) annual meeting 
in Singapore. Dust freaks have kept on organizing the session at 
subsequent AOGS meetings in Korea (2008), India (2010), and Taiwan 
(2011). The Cosmic Dust series has been recognized as the most 
successful session of the AOGS Planetary Sciences Section. In 2012, the 
time was ripe to be free from organizing restrictions on the AOGS 
meeting. From that time on, the Cosmic Dust meeting is totally 
independent of any international conference. The past meetings on Cosmic 
Dust have been held in a relaxed and joyful atmosphere. So will be the 
coming one!￼
