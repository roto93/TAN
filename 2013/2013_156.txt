Title: Entanglement Entropy for Probe Branes, the leading Backreaction.

Abstract:
Motivated by the vast utility of probe brane systems, we will review
the notion of holographic quantum entanglement entropy, together with
the extension thereof by probe brane systems through systematically
taking the leading order backreaction of the probe branes into
account.
