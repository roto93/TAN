Abstract: http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/activity/colloquium.php

*** Colloquium
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Hsin-Fang Chiang (IfA)
Topic:        The Earliest Circumstellar Disks and the Variable Young Stellar Objects Survey
Time:        3/8 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
My talk will include two parts.  First I will take about
interferometric observations and modeling of embedded young stellar
objects.  Protostars are surrounded by their natal envelopes in the
early stage, while the earliest disks form inside the envelopes.  To
understand the envelope properties and to reveal the embedded
circumstellar disk, we compare CARMA observations with theoretical
collapse models using radiative transfer calculation and Bayesian
inference.  Implications of the modeling work will be discussed.  Then
I will introduce the Variable Young Stellar Objects Survey (VYSOS)
project, which consists of two new robotic telescopes dedicated to
monitor nearby star forming regions.  Observations of VYSOS have
started in search of new eruptive events around young stars such as
FUor and EXor outbursts.

*** Special Seminar
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Tomotsugu Goto (Dark Cosmology Centre, University of Copenhagen)
Topic:        Dark energy really exists? Detecting Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect
from WISE data.
Time:        3/6 (Wednesday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
We estimated the cross-power spectra of a galaxy sample from the
Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) survey with the 7-year
Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) temperature anisotropy
maps. A conservatively-selected galaxy sample covers ~13000sq.deg,
with a median redshift of z=0.15. Cross-power spectra show
correlations between the two data sets with no discernible dependence
on the WMAP Q, V and W frequency bands. We interpret these results in
terms of the the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect: for the |b|>20
deg sample at l=6-87, we measure the amplitude (normalized to be 1 for
vanilla LambdaCDM expectation) of the signal to be 3.4+-1.1, i.e., 3.1
sigma detection. We discuss other possibilities, but at face value,
the detection of the linear ISW effect in a flat universe is caused by
large scale decaying potentials, a sign of accelerated expansion
driven by Dark Energy.

Speaker:    Doug Simons (CFHT)
Topic:        CFHT Status Report and Future Plans
Time:        3/7 (Thursday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
Presentation Summary: After a brief summary of the nature of CFHT
Corp. and recent metrics illustrating the scientific success of CFHT,
the future of the Observatory is described through various initiatives
designed to broaden the CFHT partnership, develop new capabilities,
and take steps toward the replacement of CFHT with a powerful new
facility dedicated to highly multiplexed wide-field spectroscopy.
CFHT, in the context of the evolving landscape on Mauna Kea will also
be discussed, as CFHT positions itself among a backdrop of some older
facilities being decommissioned while new Mauna Kea facilities are on
the planning horizon.
