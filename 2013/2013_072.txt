Topic:        Forming the Luminous OB Clusters at the Convergences of the Large Scale Molecular Filaments
Time:        4/19 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
Observations on distance <300 pc molecular clouds have shown that the nearby young YSO clusters form at the convergences of the molecular filaments. The preliminary analytical hub-filament model was proposed for describing this phenomenon. Our survey on a few most luminous Galactic OB cluster forming regions shows that their parent giant molecular clouds also have the hub-filament geometrical configuration. At the convergences of the filaments, the high density and the high external pressure may promote the accretion and the star-forming efficiency. I will elaborate the overall geometry and kinematics of the luminous OB cluster forming molecular clouds with two case studies, based on the synthesized SMA+IRAM-30m observations. One case is the molecular cloud G10.6-0.4 located in the near 3 kpc spiral arm. The other is the unique Galactic mini-starburst region W49A. We hope to shed some light on the paradigm of the formation of gravitationally bound massive cluster.

Topic:        Introduction to the Pencil Code
Time:        4/18 (Thursday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1108
Abstract:
The Pencil Code is a parallelized, cache-efficient simulation code, capable of evolving magnetohydrodynamics and particles, among many other physics.  It employs high-order finite differences to attain high fidelity in short wavelengths and is thus ideal for simulating turbulent flows.  I will introduce the basic ideas behind the Pencil Code and how we collaborate on developing and maintaining the code.  Then I will briefly touch upon what I have used the code in my own research, including magneto-rotational turbulence, planetary dynamics, and chemical mixing in galactic disks.
