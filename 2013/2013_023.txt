http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/en/news/AO_2013/index.php 

              In support of this AO the UM will feature a town-hall 
session featuring presentations by teams intending to submit 
development proposals in addition to hosting a community discussion of 
the possible future directions to be taken by the Observatory. The 
10th CFHT UM therefore represents an important opportunity for the 
community to reflect upon the considerable scientific achievements of 
the observatory and its users in addition to engaging actively in the 
discussion of our future path. 

                                              Aloha, 

                                                              Doug
