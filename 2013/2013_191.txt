Dear Colleagues,

You are cordially invited to attend the Joint Colloquium which will be held
on November 5 (
http://web.phys.ntu.edu.tw/jwc/2013_Fall_colloquia/Joint%20colloquia%20fall=
%202013.html
).

The Joint Colloquium Series is organized by the NTU Physics Department,
Center for Condensed Matter Science (CCMS), Leung Center for Cosmology and
Particle Astrophysics (LeCosPA), Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and
Astrophysics (ASIAA), and the Institute of Atomic and Molecular Sciences
(IAMS).

The idea is to have excellent speakers to give inspiring, informative, but
non-technical talks on the frontiers of Sciences.

Enclosed below is the information of the Joint Colloquium on November 5.

Best regards,

Yen-Ting Lin (ASIAA)
Michitoshi Hayashi (CCMS)
Lain-Jong Li (IAMS)
Jiwoo Nam (LeCosPA)
Juinn-Wei Chen (NTU-Phys)

ASIAA/CCMS/IAMS/LeCosPA/NTU-Physics Joint Colloquium

Speaker: Kian Ping Loh (=C1_=BD=A8=C6=BD =BD=CC=CA=DA)

Topic : Interesting Properties of Strained and Defective Graphene

Time  : 11/05 (Tue.) 14:20 - 15:20

Place : Room 104, CCMS-New Physics Building

Abstract:
    Most people think of graphene as a flat membrane and the quality of
physics observation depends on the flatness of it. However defective or
strained graphene can present interesting properties, especially to a
chemist. For example, generating pores or voids in graphene, oxidizing and
disrupting the conjugation, as in the case of nanoporous graphene oxide,
can generate a material that is catalytically active =A8C what the chemists
called =A1=B0carbocatalyst=A1=B1. Nanoporous graphene oxide can mediate a w=
ide range
of chemical transformation. We have managed to identify a simple chemical
treatment to introduce porosity and tune the acidity of Graphene Oxide
(GO). This is a potentially important area for industrial applications. The
GO catalyst can be used in oxidative coupling reactions as well as tandem
catalytic reactions.
    Generating strain textures on graphene allows the engineering of new
energy landscape. The Dirac electrons in graphene couples to strain via
pseudomagnetic field, creating an electrodynamics that is controlled by the
geometry of the strain. Using the graphene Moir=A8=A6 superlattice,
geometrically precise nanobubbles can be generated that show pseudomagnetic
field in the hundreds of Telsa. We discuss the chemistry of how such strain
texture can be created by controlling sub-surface defects on the metal
substrate. Nanobubbles on graphene can also be created when graphene is
transferred onto diamond. Very robust interfacial bonding between diamond
and graphene allows a hydrothermal anvil to be created at the interface.
Superheated water trapped at the interface becomes corrosive at high
temperature and pressure and can etch diamond [3]. By monitoring the
conformational changes of pressure-sensitive molecules , the pressure
within the nanobubble could be tracked as a function of temperature and was
found to be at ~1 GPa at 600 deg C. The polymerization of
buckminsterfullerene(C60), which is symmetrically forbidden under ambient
conditions, was observed to proceed in well-defined stages in the
pressurized nanobubbles.
