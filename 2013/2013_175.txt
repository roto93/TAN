          Astronomy Colloquium
############################################

    2:20 p.m. 11 Oct. 2013 (Friday)
      NTHU Physics Building, Rm620

    Speaker: Dr. Jing Wang
              (NTHU)

    Title: Who are the major players behind the
            exotic phenomena in cosmic scheme ?
            From accretion-power neutron star to
            dark side of universe


    Abstract:
    Neutron stars, as the most compact objects known in the
    universe, demonstrate exotic phenomena and provide extreme
    conditions, which make themselves as the natural laboratories.
    In this talk, I will focus on accretion-powered neutron star and
    discuss accretion physics under strong magnetic field and
    accretion-induced evolution and variability of neutron star.
    Considering the mass problem, I will also extend neutron-star
    accretion to large scale structure and try to establish connection
    between accreting compact objects and some issues of cosmology.

    Tea/Discussion Time is followed in the same room.

                      All Welcome !!

*** Colloquium
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Matthias Maercker (University of Bonn)
Topic:        Unwinding the secrets of thermal pulses and sculpted winds in AGB stars with ALMA
Time:        10/9 (Wednesday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
I will present ALMA Cycle 0 observations of the CO emission around the
carbon AGB star R Sculptoris. 
The observations show the detached shell and circumstellar medium
around this star in unprecedented
detail, and demonstrate the power of ALMA already during the first
cycle of operations. The detached
shell is formed due to the change in mass-loss rate and expansion
velocity during a thermal pulse.
Amazingly, the data also reveal a clear, and previously unobserved,
spiral structure within and connected
to the detached shell, indicating the presence of a companion star or
high-mass planet. Combined with
3-dimensional hydrodynamical models, we for the first time set direct
observational constraints on the
changes in mass-loss rate and expansion velocity during and after a
thermal pulse. By modelling the stellar
wind from a binary system, we show that the observed spiral constrains
the mass-loss rate and expansion
velocity, the duration of the pulse, and the companion mass. The
results imply a change in pulse to
post-pulse mass-loss rate by a factor of 30, and a gradual decrease of
the expansion velocity. We are thus
able to uncover the record of mass-loss throughout the thermal-pulse
cycle in unprecedented detail. The
results usher in a new paradigm in our understanding of this
fundamental period of stellar evolution, and
the implications it has for the chemical evolution of evolved stars,
the ISM, and galaxies.



*** ASIAA/NTU Joint Colloquium

Speaker:    Gil Holder (McGill University)
Topic:        The Cosmic Microwave Background in High Definition
Time:        10/8 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:10
Place:        Room 104, CCMS-New Physics Building
Abstract:
High resolution studies of the cosmic microwave background
provide new views on neutrinos, dark energy, and cosmological
structure formation. This new information comes through an improved
understanding of the primary fluctuations imprinted in the early
universe, as well as through measurements of the effects of Compton
scattering and gravitational lensing by structure in the late
universe. I'll report  results from the South Pole Telescope,
including a recent detection of the characteristic "B-mode" pattern of
polarized fluctuations that is caused by gravitational lensing.



*** Special Seminar
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Gil Holder (McGill University)
Topic:        Mapping Dark Matter on the Largest and Smallest Scales
Time:        10/7 (Monday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
I'll talk about two different gravitational lensing projects based on
mm-wave data. It is now possible to  map dark matter on degree scales
over large areas of sky through the gravitational lensing of the
cosmic microwave background, allowing new constraints on the
clustering of matter and the relation between galaxies and mass.  At
the other end of the spectrum (on small scales), there are now large
samples of galaxy-scale multiple-image gravitational lenses observed
with ALMA.  It should now be possible to use these lens systems to
detect small-scale substructure in the dark matter halos of the
lensing galaxies and establish whether the small-scale features in
galactic dark matter are consistent with the predictions of cold dark
matter.

Dear Colleagues,

You are cordially invited to attend the Joint Colloquium which will be held
on October 15.

The Joint Colloquium Series is organized by the NTU Physics Department,
Center for Condensed Matter Science (CCMS), Leung Center for Cosmology and
Particle Astrophysics (LeCosPA), Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and
Astrophysics (ASIAA), and the Institute of Atomic and Molecular Sciences
(IAMS).

The idea is to have excellent speakers to give inspiring, informative, but
non-technical talks on the frontiers of Sciences.

Enclosed below is the information of the Joint Colloquium on October 15.

Best regards,

Yen-Ting Lin (ASIAA)
Michitoshi Hayashi (CCMS)

      Title: Fueling starburst rings and/or AGNs
              in barred spiral galaxies

      Abstract:
We examine how spiral density waves excited at
the outer inner Lindblad resonances fuel central
activities in NGC 6782, NGC 1097, and NGC 4945
by detailed comparisons of our hydrodynamical
simulation results with observations. We find that
bar potential can effectively transport gas into
the central region of galaxies to fuel the starburst
rings and/or AGNs.
