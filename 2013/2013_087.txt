Prof. Andrew Fabian of University of Cambridge, and "The Search for Life in the
Universe" (on May 26) by Dr. Donald Goldsmith, the winner of the Annenberg Award
of American Astronomical Society in astronomy education, and the Dorothea
Klumpke-Roberts Award of Astronomical Society of the Pacific in popularization
of astronomy, respectively. The scientific program, including oral talks and
poster presentations, is now available at the meeting website:
