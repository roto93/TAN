Dear Colleagues,

You are cordially invited to attend the Joint Colloquium which will be held
on October 15.

The Joint Colloquium Series is organized by the NTU Physics Department,
Center for Condensed Matter Science (CCMS), Leung Center for Cosmology and
Particle Astrophysics (LeCosPA), Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and
Astrophysics (ASIAA), and the Institute of Atomic and Molecular Sciences
(IAMS).

The idea is to have excellent speakers to give inspiring, informative, but
non-technical talks on the frontiers of Sciences.

Enclosed below is the information of the Joint Colloquium on October 15.

Best regards,

Yen-Ting Lin (ASIAA)
Michitoshi Hayashi (CCMS)
Lain-Jong Li (IAMS)
Jiwoo Nam (LeCosPA)
Juinn-Wei Chen (NTU-Phys)

Brief Bio
Prof. Maw-Kuen Wu (=A7d=ADZ=A9=F8) is a Chinese-American physicist speciali=
zing in
superconductivity, low-temperature physics, and high-pressure physics. He
was a professor of physics at Columbia University. He made the historic
discovery of superconductivity above 77 K in YBCO in 1987. Wu was then
invited to teach at the National Tsing Hua University, and conduct further
research in high-temperature superconductivity. He served as Chairman of
the R.O.C. National Science Council from 2004 to 2006. He currently serves
as both the Director of the Institute of Physics at the Academia Sinica
and the President of the National Dong Hwa University.
