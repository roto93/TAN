Dear Prospective ALMA users,

Call for Proposals for ALMA Cycle 2

The ALMA Director, on behalf of the Joint ALMA Observatory (JAO) and the=20=

partner organizations in East Asia, Europe, and North America, is
pleased to announce the Early Science Cycle 2 Call for Proposals (CfP).
Members of the astronomical community are invited to propose for
scientific observations that will be scheduled from June 2014 to October
2015.

At full operational capability, the ALMA Observatory will include an =
array of fifty=20
12-m antennas for long baseline interferometric observations (the 12-m
Array), and the Atacama Compact Array (ACA, aka Morita Array) composed
of twelve 7-m antennas for short baseline interferometric observations
(7-m Array) and four 12-m antennas for single-dish observations (Total
Power or TP Array).

Cycle 2 observations provide an exciting opportunity for science from =
this unique=20
world-class facility, though completion of the full 66-antenna array
remains the highest ALMA priority.
