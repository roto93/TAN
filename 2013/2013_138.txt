*** Colloquium
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Masaaki Otsuka (ASIAA)
Topic:        A search for fullerene C60 in Galactic Planetary Nebula
Time:        8/2 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
Since their laboratory discoveries in 1985, particularly fullerene C60 have drawn considerable interest from astrochemists looking for them in interstellar conditions. Fullerenes are extremely stable and easily form in laboratories on the earth, so it had been thought that they should exist in interstellar space. However, the first confirmed detection of cosmic fullerenes was only recently reported in the C-rich planetary nebula (PN) Tc1. So far, C60 has been found in about 20 objects, however it is still unclear what kind of environment is required to formed C60 and how C60 is excited in the iterstellar scpace. To answer these questions, I have searched all the Spitzer and ISO data archival spectra of Galactic PNe since 2011 Nov. I will present recent results on my C60 PN study.



*** Special Seminar

Speaker:    Robert Laing (ESO)
Topic:        Precision Jet Physics
Time:        7/31 (Wednesday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
Relativistic jets are important in many areas of astrophysics: they are efficient particle accelerators, producing the highest-energy photons (and perhaps also cosmic rays) we observe; they are an inevitable consequence of accretion onto black holes, from which they efficiently extract energy, and they transport this energy to large distances, providing feedback in galaxies and clusters. 

After introducing the jet pheonomenon in its Galactic and Extragalactic manifestations, I will discuss the results of a long-term programme aimed at understanding the physics of large-scale jets in nearby radio galaxies. We model very deep, high-resolution VLA images in total intensity and linear polarization, exploiting the side-to-side asymmetries caused by special relativistic aberration to deduce their geometries and their variations of  velocity, field structure and emissivity in three dimensions.  We find that the jets decelerate and develop transverse velocity profiles as they entrain the surrounding insterstellar medium. We also show that ongoing particle acceleration is velocity-dependent and demonstrate the evolution of the magnetic field to a predominantly toroidal configuration.  Finally, we deduce the mass, momentum and energy fluxes of the jets and estimate their energy input into their surroundings.
