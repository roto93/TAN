Topic:        Unwinding the secrets of thermal pulses and sculpted winds in AGB stars with ALMA
Time:        10/9 (Wednesday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
I will present ALMA Cycle 0 observations of the CO emission around the
carbon AGB star R Sculptoris. 
The observations show the detached shell and circumstellar medium
around this star in unprecedented
detail, and demonstrate the power of ALMA already during the first
cycle of operations. The detached
shell is formed due to the change in mass-loss rate and expansion
velocity during a thermal pulse.
Amazingly, the data also reveal a clear, and previously unobserved,
spiral structure within and connected
to the detached shell, indicating the presence of a companion star or
high-mass planet. Combined with
3-dimensional hydrodynamical models, we for the first time set direct
observational constraints on the
changes in mass-loss rate and expansion velocity during and after a
thermal pulse. By modelling the stellar
wind from a binary system, we show that the observed spiral constrains
the mass-loss rate and expansion
velocity, the duration of the pulse, and the companion mass. The
results imply a change in pulse to
post-pulse mass-loss rate by a factor of 30, and a gradual decrease of
the expansion velocity. We are thus
able to uncover the record of mass-loss throughout the thermal-pulse
cycle in unprecedented detail. The
results usher in a new paradigm in our understanding of this
fundamental period of stellar evolution, and
the implications it has for the chemical evolution of evolved stars,
the ISM, and galaxies.

Topic:        The Cosmic Microwave Background in High Definition
Time:        10/8 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:10
Place:        Room 104, CCMS-New Physics Building
Abstract:
High resolution studies of the cosmic microwave background
provide new views on neutrinos, dark energy, and cosmological
structure formation. This new information comes through an improved
understanding of the primary fluctuations imprinted in the early
universe, as well as through measurements of the effects of Compton
scattering and gravitational lensing by structure in the late
universe. I'll report  results from the South Pole Telescope,
including a recent detection of the characteristic "B-mode" pattern of
polarized fluctuations that is caused by gravitational lensing.

Speaker:    Gil Holder (McGill University)
Topic:        Mapping Dark Matter on the Largest and Smallest Scales
Time:        10/7 (Monday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
I'll talk about two different gravitational lensing projects based on
mm-wave data. It is now possible to  map dark matter on degree scales
over large areas of sky through the gravitational lensing of the
cosmic microwave background, allowing new constraints on the
clustering of matter and the relation between galaxies and mass.  At
the other end of the spectrum (on small scales), there are now large
samples of galaxy-scale multiple-image gravitational lenses observed
with ALMA.  It should now be possible to use these lens systems to
detect small-scale substructure in the dark matter halos of the
lensing galaxies and establish whether the small-scale features in
galactic dark matter are consistent with the predictions of cold dark
matter.
