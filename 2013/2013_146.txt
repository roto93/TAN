Topic:        Discovery of extremely lead-rich hot subdwarfs: does heavy metal signal the formation of subdwarf B stars?
Time:        8/23 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
Hot subdwarfs represent a group of low-mass helium-burning stars formed through binary-star interactions and include some of the most chemically-peculiar stars in the Galaxy. Stellar evolution theory suggests that they should have helium-rich atmospheres but, a majority are extremely helium poor because radiation causes hydrogen to diffuse upwards. The existence of spectroscopically  different helium-rich subdwarfs poses several questions; are there distinct subgroup of hot subdwarfs, or do hot subdwarfs change their atmospheric composition during evolution. I will present the evolutionary status of hot subdwarfs both in single star and binary star systems and observational implications based on the discovery of extreme peculiar chemical signatures. Using optical spectroscopy we have reported two extreme lead rich stars in the Galaxy with 4 dex overabundances of lead relative to solar. The lead abundance is ten to 100 times that measured in normal hot subdwarf atmospheres fr!
om ultraviolet spectroscopy. The new observations are interpreted in terms of heavily stratified atmospheres and the general picture of a surface chemistry in transition from a new-born helium-rich subdwarf to a normal helium-poor subdwarf.
