Dear colleagues,

I am forwarding an announcement of the dust meeting
held in Japan next year.

Regards,

MEETING TITLE:
Cosmic Dust

WEBSITE:
https://www.cps-jp.org/~dust/

VENUE (tentative):
Umeda Satellite Campus of Osaka Sangyo University
Osaka station 3 building (Osaka Ekimae 3rd Bldg.), 19th floor
1-2-3, Umeda, Kita-ku, Osaka 530-0001, JAPAN

DATE:
Monday, August 4 – Friday, August 8, 2014

OBJECTIVES:
This series of Cosmic Dust meetings aims at finding a consensus among 
experts on the formation and evolution of cosmic dust: where it comes 
from and where it goes. The meeting is organized by dust freaks who are 
very enthusiastic not only to make the goal achievable but also to 
establish a dust community across every scientifically relevant 
discipline for the development of cosmic dust research. For this reason, 
the primary objectives of the meeting are to bring together 
professionals who deal with cosmic dust and to provide an opportunity 
for participants to develop human relations and interactions among the 
participants.

SCOPE:
All kinds of cosmic dust such as
• intergalactic dust
• circumnuclear dust
• interstellar dust
• protoplanetary disk dust
• debris disk dust
• cometary dust
• interplanetary dust
• circumplanetary dust
• stellar nebular condensates
• presolar grains
• micrometeorites
• meteoroids
• meteors
• regolith particles
• planetary aerosols
are the subject of discussion. The meeting is open for any aspects of 
dust research by means of different methods of studies (in-situ and 
laboratory measurements, astronomical observations, laboratory and 
numerical simulations, theoretical modeling, data analyses, etc.). All 
dust-related topics, for example, the formation of molecules and their 
reactions on and their desorption from the surface of dust particles, 
are also welcome. Publishing the proceedings of this meeting is 
currently being planned as a special issue of a peer-reviewed journal, 
while paper submission to the proceedings is not obligatory.

ADMISSIONS APPLICATION:
Please complete online meeting application at the CPS website in order 
to attend the meeting (deadline: May 13, 2014, 11:59 p.m. Japan Standard 
Time).
https://www.cps-jp.org/~dust/Application.html
Because the number of participants shall be limited to approximately 50, 
the online application does not guarantee admission to the meeting. 
Participants will be determined at the discretion of the SOC and all 
applicants will be notified of the admissions decision by May 31, 2014. 
Priority will be given to those who contribute to oral or poster 
sessions and retain enthusiasm for discussions throughout the meeting. 
For further details, please visit the Cosmic Dust website.

REGISTRATION FEE:
The early bird rate of 10,000 JPY is available for those who complete 
both admissions application and abstract submission by April 30, 2013. 
The registration fee for those who complete admissions application on 
and after May 1, 2014 is 15,000 JPY. While no payment is required at the 
time of admissions application and abstract submission, the registration 
fee should be paid by cash on arrival at the venue. No matter what 
circumstances are specified, the registration fee will not be waived.

BRIEF HISTORY:
The Cosmic Dust meeting started in 2006 as a session called “Cosmic 
Dust” of the 3rd AOGS (Asia-Oceania Geoscience Society) annual meeting 
in Singapore. Dust freaks have kept on organizing the session at 
subsequent AOGS meetings in Korea (2008), India (2010), and Taiwan 
(2011). The Cosmic Dust series has been recognized as the most 
successful session of the AOGS Planetary Sciences Section. In 2012, the 
time was ripe to be free from organizing restrictions on the AOGS 
meeting. From that time on, the Cosmic Dust meeting is totally 
independent of any international conference. The past meetings on Cosmic 
Dust have been held in a relaxed and joyful atmosphere. So will be the 
coming one!￼
