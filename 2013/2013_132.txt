Abstract: http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/activity/colloquium.php

*** Colloquium
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Robert Wittenmyer (University of New South Wales)
Topic:        Exoplanetary Science in Australia: Detection, Characterisation, and
Destruction
Time:        7/12 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
I give an update on three major exoplanetary science initiatives being
pursued by Australian-based planet-search teams.  Further observations
from the Anglo-Australian Planet Search (AAPS) have revealed that some
systems previously thought to contain a single, moderate-eccentricity
planet are better fit by two planets on nearly-circular orbits.  We have
investigated apparent single-planet systems to see if the available data
can be better fit by two lower-eccentricity planets.  We identify nine
promising candidate systems and perform detailed dynamical tests to
confirm the stability of the potential new multiple-planet systems.  In
addition to the AAPS, I describe the Pan-Pacific Planet Search, a
radial-velocity survey of Southern hemisphere evolved, intermediate-mass
stars using the 3.9m Anglo-Australian Telescope.  We currently achieve
velocity precisions of 3-6 m/s, and there are several planet candidates
emerging as more data are obtained.

I then describe a plan for Minerva: an installation of four 0.7m
telescopes feeding a high-resolution spectrograph, sited at Mt Hopkins
in Arizona.  Minerva will give exoplanetary scientists the ability to
pursue dedicated radial-velocity searches for planets orbiting the
nearest bright stars.  In addition, a Southern hemisphere Minerva could
be used to follow up on objects of interest from Antarctic telescopes
such as the Chinese AST-3.  I will describe the diverse science cases
for this highly cost-effective facility.

Finally, I present results from our recent series of papers in which we
have performed extensive suites of dynamical simulations to test the
veracity of proposed multiple-planet systems.  We show that some systems
are strongly constrained by protected low-order resonances, while others
are wildly unstable on short timescales.  This work highlights the
critical need to include dynamical stability analysis as an integral
part of the discovery process for candidate multi-planet systems.

Speaker:    Kuo-Chuan Pan (UIUC)
Topic:        Search for Surviving Post-Impact Remnant Stars in Type Ia Supernova Remnants
Time:        7/9 (Tuesday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1108
Abstract:
The nature of the progenitor systems of Type Ia supernovae is still unclear. One way to distinguish between the SDS and DDS is to search for the surviving Post-Impact Remnant Stars (PIRSs). Using our stellar evolution simulations of main-sequence- (MS-) and helium-rich- (He-) PIRSs, we predict the color and magnitude of MS- and He-PIRSs as functions of time. We also discuss PIRS candidates in Galactic Type Ia supernova remnants (Ia SNRs), including SN 185, SN 1006, SN 1574, SN 1604, and G1.9+0.3, and nearby extragalactic Ia SNRs. We find that the maximum detectable distance of MS PIRSs (He PIRSs) is 0.6âˆ’4 Mpc (0.4 âˆ’ 16 Mpc), if the apparent magnitude limit is 27 and we assume no extinction, suggesting the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC/SMC) and the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) are excellent environments in which to search for PIRSs.

********************** Second Announcement *******************************

    The Life Cycle of Dust in the Universe:
    Observations, Theory, and Laboratory Experiments

    November 18-22, 2013, Taipei, Taiwan

    http://events.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/meeting/20131118/

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT NOTICE FOR PARTICIPANTS FROM CHINA:

Participants from the PRC interested in participating in the meeting,
should note that it takes 3 to 4 months in total to apply for a travel
permit. Please contact the LOC before July 18, 2013 at
lcod2013@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

OBJECTIVES:

This meeting aims to address the life cycle of dust in the Universe,
which covers the formation, evolution and destruction of dust in a
range of environments, ranging from the smallest to the largest
scales. Bringing together observational and theoretical
astrophysicists as well as meteoriticists and experimentalists will
allow for a cross-disciplinary dialogue.

The meeting follows a successful tradition of astrophysical dust
meetings, starting in Albany in 1972, with the latest edition "Cosmic
Dust: Near and Far" organized by Th. Henning taking place in
Heidelberg in 2008.

Since that meeting, the field of dust astrophysics has made major
leaps forward with the hoist of data arriving from such missions as
the infrared space telescopes Spitzer, Herschel, and Stardust, the
latter returning dust samples from comet Wild-2 currently being
studied in the lab. The largest telescope on Earth, ALMA, has recently
come online, allowing for investigations into the origin of dust in
the Universe. Thus, this is an excellent time to review the status of
the field of dust astrophysics in this meeting.

The meeting aims to create an environment in which all aspects of the
life cycle of dust will be discussed, from an astrophysical, chemical
and mineralogical perspective, and the effect on a range of
environments. Observational insights, theoretical models and
experimental approaches all contribute to our view of the life cycle
of dust, and the meeting will address new developments and future
projects in all these areas.

*** Colloquium
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Mark Morris (UCLA)
Topic:        Past and Future Activity of the Galactic Black Hole
Time:        7/17 (Wednesday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
An X-ray light echo now propagating through the central molecular zone
of our Galaxy has revealed that a major X-ray flare took place there about 
100 years ago.  The high luminosity and the direction of propagation implicate
the central supermassive black hole in our galaxy, which is presently very
quiescent.  I will discuss this evidence, and the outstanding possibilities for 
what might have caused this activity.  This may not be a particularly rare event;
a gaseous object -- possibly centered on a star -- is now plummeting toward 
the black hole on a highly eccentric orbit and is expected to supply new fuel
for enhanced accretion activity during and after its passage through periapse 
in early 2014.  I will present the view of this object from UCLA, based on data
obtained at the Keck Observatory.


*** Special Seminar
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Kaiki Inoue (Kinki University)
Topic:        Probing dark matter with mini-gravitational lensing
Time:        7/15 (Monday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
Recently, our group have shown that the MIR flux-ratio anomalies
seen in some quadruple lens systems can be solely explained by the
weak lensing effects caused by mini-halos and mini-voids in the
line-of-sight. In our model, the number of halos and voids in the
line-of-sight monotonically increases as a function of the source
redshift, which are consistent with the observational trend. In
literature, it has been postulated that the flux-ratio anomaly is
mainly caused by subhalos in the lensing galaxy.  Therefore, our
findings may challenge this "standard" picture. Using our result,
we would be able to put stringent constraints on the mass scale of
dark matter particles that have a large free-streaming scale such
as sterile neutrinos and super-WIMPs.  In this talk, as an
introduction, I review the physical mechanisms that are used for
categorizing dark matter via structure formation and explain about
the basics about gravitational lensing. Then I present recent
results on the perturbation induced by line-of-sight mini-structures
in quasar-galaxy quadruple lens systems. Finally, I briefly comment
on the possible constraints on dark matter particles from our result
and how we can distinguish these structures from subhalos in lensing
galaxies in future observations.
