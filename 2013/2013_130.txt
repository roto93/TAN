*** Colloquium
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Mark Morris (UCLA)
Topic:        Past and Future Activity of the Galactic Black Hole
Time:        7/17 (Wednesday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
An X-ray light echo now propagating through the central molecular zone
of our Galaxy has revealed that a major X-ray flare took place there about 
100 years ago.  The high luminosity and the direction of propagation implicate
the central supermassive black hole in our galaxy, which is presently very
quiescent.  I will discuss this evidence, and the outstanding possibilities for 
what might have caused this activity.  This may not be a particularly rare event;
a gaseous object -- possibly centered on a star -- is now plummeting toward 
the black hole on a highly eccentric orbit and is expected to supply new fuel
for enhanced accretion activity during and after its passage through periapse 
in early 2014.  I will present the view of this object from UCLA, based on data
obtained at the Keck Observatory.

Speaker:    Kaiki Inoue (Kinki University)
Topic:        Probing dark matter with mini-gravitational lensing
Time:        7/15 (Monday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
Recently, our group have shown that the MIR flux-ratio anomalies
seen in some quadruple lens systems can be solely explained by the
weak lensing effects caused by mini-halos and mini-voids in the
line-of-sight. In our model, the number of halos and voids in the
line-of-sight monotonically increases as a function of the source
redshift, which are consistent with the observational trend. In
literature, it has been postulated that the flux-ratio anomaly is
mainly caused by subhalos in the lensing galaxy.  Therefore, our
findings may challenge this "standard" picture. Using our result,
we would be able to put stringent constraints on the mass scale of
dark matter particles that have a large free-streaming scale such
as sterile neutrinos and super-WIMPs.  In this talk, as an
introduction, I review the physical mechanisms that are used for
categorizing dark matter via structure formation and explain about
the basics about gravitational lensing. Then I present recent
results on the perturbation induced by line-of-sight mini-structures
in quasar-galaxy quadruple lens systems. Finally, I briefly comment
on the possible constraints on dark matter particles from our result
and how we can distinguish these structures from subhalos in lensing
galaxies in future observations.
