                      Penghu, May 24 - 26, 2013

The 3rd Circular


ASROC2013, the 2013 Scientific Assembly of the Astronomical Society of the
Republic of China, will be held at National Penghu University of Science and
Technology on May 24-26 (Fri-Sun). This is the annual event for all astronomers
and astrophysicists in Taiwan to report their latest results and to exchange
new ideas. ASROC2013 is an excellent venue, too, for graduate students to
present their research findings and/or progress from thesis studies.

Besides scientific and educational sessions, poster presentations, and a
business meeting, ASROC2013 will also include two plenary talks: "Probing
Strong Gravity with Accreting Black Holes" (on May 25) given by the former
President of the Royal Astronomical Society and a Fellow of the Royal Society,
Prof. Andrew Fabian of University of Cambridge, and "The Search for Life in the
Universe" (on May 26) by Dr. Donald Goldsmith, the winner of the Annenberg Award
of American Astronomical Society in astronomy education, and the Dorothea
Klumpke-Roberts Award of Astronomical Society of the Pacific in popularization
of astronomy, respectively. The scientific program, including oral talks and
poster presentations, is now available at the meeting website:
        http://www.asroc.org.tw/asroc2013/en/agenda.php

In addition to the scientific agenda, half-day group excursions are arranged at
choice in the afternoon of May 25 (Sat); conference banquet will be held later
in the evening and all meeting participants are welcome
(http://www.asroc.org.tw/asroc2013/en/tourbanquet.php). During the meeting,
astronomical book and instrumentation exhibition are also scheduled. Given the
meeting date overlap the annual Penghu Firework Festival, participants of
ASROC2013 are strongly encouraged to make travel arrangements and hotel booking
as soon as possible
(http://www.asroc.org.tw/asroc2013/en/travelNAccom.php#travel).

The online registration of ASROC2013 is now closed; those who missed the online
registration can still register on-site. A registration fee of NT$500 should be
paid on site. Registration fee will be waived for ASROC members with 2013 annual
membership fee paid.

The Local Organizing Committee would like to remind all participants of the
following items:

* Meeting Venue:
The ASROC meeting will be held at the International Conference Hall in the
Marine Science & Technology Building (N) of National Penghu University of
Science and Technology. The registration desk/area is located in front of the
conference hall. More information about access to the Penghu University can be
found at the meeting webpage. On-campus parking is available and is free of
charge; please show the A4-size ASROC2013 meeting poster (can be downloaded at
http://www.asroc.org.tw/asroc2013/doc/asroc2013poster_A4.pdf) to campus police
when entering the university and leave it on the dash board when parked.

* Oral Presentations:
Oral contributions are scheduled for 12/15/18/20 minutes in length (including
3 minutes Q&A). All speakers are strongly recommended to load your presentation
files onto the on-site computer before your session. The meeting will provide
computers equipped with Microsoft and Mac platforms and standard presentation
software. Please test your presentations in advance.

The physical size of the poster board is about 90 cm wide and 180 cm high.
Posters should be set up before 5:00 pm on May 24. Authors can identify their
poster boards by the tagged ID number on top of each board. All posters should
be removed by their authors before 3:00 pm on May 26.
    A competition for the Best Poster Award among student presentations will be
held during the meeting. Poster authors are recommended to attend their posters
during coffee breaks. The three awardees will be given the opportunity to
present a 3-minute oral report each on their award-winning research work in the
General Assembly to be held at 10:00 - 10:45 am on May 26 (Sun).

* Tours:
For those who signed up for excursions on May 25 (Saturday), there are two tour
options (http://www.asroc.org.tw/asroc2013/en/tourbanquet.php). Tour A is a
Penghu Island-wide trip and Tour B is a Offshore platform trip. Your choice of
tour will be made on the first-come, first-choice bases. Please inform the LOC
your tour preference at your earliest convenience.

* Payment:
Payment includes the registration fee (NT$ 500/person), tour (about NT$450 per
person), and banquet (NT$50/person). Please prepare exact changes for your
applicable payment at the time of registration.

Again, the ASROC sincerely welcome you to joining the 2013 Annual Meeting.

Dear Prof. Kuan


On the behalf of LOC of the Lin-Shu Symposium, I would like to announce the Lin-Shu symposium via TAN. The announcement is listed below. I will deeply appreciate your help. Thanks.


-------------------------------------------------------------
The Lin-Shu Symposium: 50 Years of Spiral Density Waves

                Beijing, June 24-28 2013

Zhou Pei-Yuan Center for Applied Mathematics, Tsinghua University


This symposium is dedicated to Prof. Chia-Chiao Lin, who passed away recently on January 13, 2013. Prof. Lin left behind a profound legacy in applied mathematics, fluid dynamics, and astrophysics. Please join us for the reflections and remembrances from broad perspectives of astrophysics.

The science program was motivated by the 50th anniversary of the publication of the path breaking paper by Profs. C. C. Lin and F. H. Shu on the density wave theory of spiral structures in galaxies.  Their pioneering work has laid the foundation for the developments in the origin and maintenance of spiral structure and has also had implications in other areas of modern astronomy such as theories of star formation and rings around planets. 

In memory of Prof. Lin and his contributions in astrophysics, we will review the development of density wave theory over the last 50 years. Specific attention will be focused on evaluating their impact on theory and observation with a view toward the future.  Phenomena occurring both near and far, from the small scale to the large scale, will be discussed.  The conference will feature presentations including satellite disks surrounding planets, disks around young stars, and the many faces of spiral structures in galaxies.

The lessons learned in the past 50 years and the directions for the future will be actively discussed.  Generations of scientists are sincerely invited to gather together to witness the scientific advances and understanding made through the studies and applications of density waves, and the connections to fluid dynamics and applied mathematics.

Abstract :
    In the last decade, super-resolution techniques, including stimulated emission depletion (STED), structured illumination, and localization scheme, have revolutionized optical microscopy and related applications. The spatial resolution has now achieved a few tens of nanometers, greatly surpassing the Abbe’s diffraction limit and allowing unprecedented imaging of micro-structures, particularly in life sciences.
    This presentation will discuss the working principles, the challenges, and the implications following the above advancements.
