Dear Colleagues,

You are cordially invited to attend the Joint Colloquium which will be held on June 04 .
The Joint Colloquium Series is organized by
the NTU Physics Department, Center for Condensed Matter Science (CCMS),
Leung Center for Cosmology and Particle Astrophysics (LeCosPA),
Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA),
and the Institute of Atomic and Molecular Sciences (IAMS).
The idea is to have excellent speakers to give inspiring, informative,
but non-technical talks on the frontiers of Sciences.

Enclosed below is the information of the Joint Colloquium on June 04.

Best regards,

Pisin Chen (LeCosPA)
Ting-Wai Chiu (NTU-Phys)
Michitoshi Hayashi (CCMS)
Lain-Jong Li (IAMS)
Michihiro Takami (ASIAA)

ASIAA/CCMS/IAMS/LeCosPA/NTU-Physics Joint Colloquium
Speaker: Professor Sinya Aoki (青木慎也 教授)
        (Yukawa Institute for Theoretical Physics, Kyoto University, Japan)
Topic : Nuclear forces from quarks and gluons
Time  : 06/04(Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:10
Place : Room 104, CCMS-New Physics Building


Abstract :
    In 1935, Dr. Hideki Yukawa, whom our institute was name after, explained nuclear forces which bind nucleons (protons and neutrons) inside nuclei, by an exchange of new particles, called pi mesons.  In the present knowledge, both nucleons and pi mesons are made of more fundamental objects, quarks and gluons, whose dynamics is described by Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). In this talk, I introduce our recent attempt to derive the nuclear forces from quarks and gluons using numerical simulations in lattice QCD, QCD defined on discrete space-time lattice.
    We first explain the strategy to extract the potentials in quantum field theories in detail. We then employ our method to derive the nucleon-nucleon potential in lattice QCD. We finally discuss recent progresses of the method applied to various systems such as hyperon-nucleon, hyperon-hyperon, meson-baryon and  3 nucleons.
