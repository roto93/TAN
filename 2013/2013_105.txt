            Astronomy Colloquium
############################################

      2:20 p.m. 7th June 2013 (Friday)
        NTHU Physics Building, Rm620

      Speaker: Dr. Hung-Yi Pu
                (ASIAA)

      Title: Greenland Telescope Project:
              Imaging the Shadow of the Black Hole

      Abstract:  ASIAA has officially acquired the 12m
      ALMA-NA Vertex Prototype Telescope in 2011.
      This telescope, now renamed as the "Greenland Telescope (GLT)",
      is going to be moved to the Summit Station in Greenland
      after upgrades. The first light of GLT at the Summit Station is
      expected to be available in 2017. Together with SMA and ALMA, the
      angular resolution of the submm VLBI system they formed will be only
      a few micro-arcseconds, providing an unique opportunity to observe
      the supermassive black hole in M87 on the event horizon. These
      observations will be extremely important for jet/accretion physics,
      as well as the general theory of relativity.

      In this talk, I will introduce the GLT project and introduce how to
      model the observed black hole "shadow" image. Such shadow (dark
      region) is expected to be observed when a black hole is
      surrounded by a bright source, such as an accretion disk.


Tea/Discussion Time is followed in the same room.

                  All Welcome !!
