Dear Colleagues,

You are cordially invited to attend the Joint Colloquium which will be held on March 26.
The Joint Colloquium Series is organized by
the NTU Physics Department, Center for Condensed Matter Science (CCMS),
Leung Center for Cosmology and Particle Astrophysics (LeCosPA),
Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA),
and the Institute of Atomic and Molecular Sciences (IAMS).
The idea is to have excellent speakers to give inspiring, informative,
but non-technical talks on the frontiers of Sciences.

Enclosed below is the information of the Joint Colloquium on March 26.
Best regards,

Pisin Chen (LeCosPA)
Ting-Wai Chiu (NTU-Phys)
Michitoshi Hayashi (CCMS)
Lain-Jong Li (IAMS)
Michihiro Takami (ASIAA)

ASIAA/CCMS/IAMS/LeCosPA/NTU-Physics Joint Colloquium
Speaker: Professor  Chen-Yuan Dong
        (Department of Physics, NTU)
Topic : Advances in Nonlinear Optical Microscopy for Biophysical Research
Time  : 03/26 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:10
Place : Room 104, CCMS-New Physics Building


Abstract :
    Advances in nonlinear optics and microscopy techniques have contributed significantly to research in biological systems. Not only can imaging through the use of techniques such as multiphoton excitation and harmonic generation provided a wealth of information on biophysical phenomena, femtosecond laser assisted photoablation can also be used to process biological systems on the micron scale. In this presentation, I will discuss the recent development of nonlinear techniques and present examples from our laboratory in which the relevant methodology can be used to advance the study of in vivo biophysics. Future developments and impacts of our studies for biomedical research will be discussed.
