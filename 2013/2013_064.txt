Dear Colleagues,

You are cordially invited to attend the Joint Colloquium which will be held on April 09.
The Joint Colloquium Series is organized by
the NTU Physics Department, Center for Condensed Matter Science (CCMS),
Leung Center for Cosmology and Particle Astrophysics (LeCosPA),
Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA),
and the Institute of Atomic and Molecular Sciences (IAMS).
The idea is to have excellent speakers to give inspiring, informative,
but non-technical talks on the frontiers of Sciences.

Enclosed below is the information of the Joint Colloquium on April 09.

Best regards,

Pisin Chen (LeCosPA)
Ting-Wai Chiu (NTU-Phys)
Michitoshi Hayashi (CCMS)
Lain-Jong Li (IAMS)
Michihiro Takami (ASIAA)

ASIAA/CCMS/IAMS/LeCosPA/NTU-Physics Joint Colloquium
Speaker: Professor  Yi-Wei Liu (¼B©Éºû ±Ð±Â)
        (Physics department of National Tsing Hau University)
Topic : The proton size puzzle(½è¤l¤j¤p¤§Á¼)
Time  : 04/09 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:10
Place : Room 104, CCMS-New Physics Building


Abstract :
    The precision laser spectroscopy of muonic hydrogen shows a large discrepancy with the current experiments and theory. The resulted charge radius of proton is 7 sigmas away from the previous measurement. In this talk, our experiment and the impact of its results will be discussed.

Brief Bio. :
    Yi-Wei Liu received the D.Phil. degree from Oxford University, Oxford, U.K. He is an Associate Professor with National Tsing-Hau University, Hsinchu, Taiwan. His researches are on the testing fundamental physics with precision laser spectroscopy and the ultracold molecule. He joined CREMA collaboration (Charge Radius Experiment with Muonic Atom ) since 2000.
