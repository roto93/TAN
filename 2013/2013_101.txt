Topic:        Death Spiral of a Star with its Companion
Time:        5/31 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
I will present the current status of the theoretical and observational understanding of spiral-shell patterns in the circumstellar envelopes of dying solar-type stars accompanied by the companions. This talk includes the explanation about the paper honored with the NSC 2012 postdoc publication award.

Evolved stars beyond the main sequence, in particular in the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) phase, can be highly obscured in dense circumstellar envelopes due to their intensive mass loss. The difficulty in detecting the obscured AGB stars leads to high uncertainties in the modeling of the late stellar evolutionary phases. In the case that the AGB star has a companion, however, the binary orbital motion leaves an imprint as a spiral-shell pattern on the circumstellar envelope. We develop a new method of determining the characteristics of such binary stars from the properties of the observed circumstellar spiral and incomplete ring patterns, revealing in the images taken with the Hubble Space Telescope and the mm/sub-mm interferometers. We use the shape of such a pattern projected on the plane of the sky as well as molecular line kinematics to further provide the three-dimensional information of the circumstellar pattern. This method is easily applicable to many sources in the!
  AGB and pre-planetary nebula phases, whose detection is highly anticipated with the ALMA.

Topic:        Astrophysical Black Holes
Time:        5/28 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:15
Place:        Room 104, CCMS-New Physics Building
Abstract:
Supermassive black holes are found at the centres of most galaxies and stellar mass black holes are common throughout galaxies.  Observations of these astrophysical black holes will be presented and discussed. Evidence will be presented that supermassive black holes  determine the final mass and shape of their host galaxies. The talk concludes with observations of the innermost regions around black holes and approaches to mapping down to the event horizon.

Topic:        The Great Observatories All-sky LIRG Survey: A Herschel and ALMA View
Time:        5/27 (Monday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
Luminous Infrared Galaxies (LIRGs) are observed primarily to be interacting and merging galaxies. They are the sites of rampant star formation and active galactic nuclei (AGN), which are fed by abundant supplies of molecular gas. However, the very property that led to their initial discovery by IRAS as a significant galaxy population - their high infrared luminosity - also makes them difficult to study; the majority of the UV and optical light from young, massive stars and AGN is absorbed by obscuring dust and re-emitted in the infrared. The Great Observatories All-sky LIRGs Survey thus makes use of the diversity in wavelength coverage of the present space-based telescopes to probe the activity in a large (~ 100 - 200), flux-limited sample of LIRGs from the Revised Bright Galaxy Sample (RBGS). The first part of the talk will be devoted to discussing the survey as a whole. The latter part of the talk will be focussed on the mode of star formation in LIRGs as derived from rece!
nt Herschel and Spitzer observations, and on recent ALMA results of the LIRG IIZw096.
