*** Special Seminar
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Tsz Yan Lam (MPA)
Topic:        Eulerian-Void Assignment and its application in modified gravity model
Time:        11/19 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
Void would be considered the underdenese analogy of massive halos and would constrain cosmological models. I will first discuss the recent development of a new algorithm to assign Eulerian void in the framework of the excursion set approach. I will then describe its application to modified gravity models, which has a distinctive feature compared to the statistics using massive halos.
