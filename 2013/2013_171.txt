                  NTHU
          Astronomy Colloquium
############################################

    2:20 p.m. 11 Oct. 2013 (Friday)
      NTHU Physics Building, Rm620

    Speaker: Dr. Jing Wang
              (NTHU)

    Title: Who are the major players behind the
            exotic phenomena in cosmic scheme ?
            From accretion-power neutron star to
            dark side of universe


    Abstract:
    Neutron stars, as the most compact objects known in the
    universe, demonstrate exotic phenomena and provide extreme
    conditions, which make themselves as the natural laboratories.
    In this talk, I will focus on accretion-powered neutron star and
    discuss accretion physics under strong magnetic field and
    accretion-induced evolution and variability of neutron star.
    Considering the mass problem, I will also extend neutron-star
    accretion to large scale structure and try to establish connection
    between accreting compact objects and some issues of cosmology.

    Tea/Discussion Time is followed in the same room.

                      All Welcome !!
