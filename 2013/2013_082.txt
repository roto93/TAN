Dear Colleagues,

You are cordially invited to attend the Joint Colloquium which will be held on May 07.
The Joint Colloquium Series is organized by
the NTU Physics Department, Center for Condensed Matter Science (CCMS),
Leung Center for Cosmology and Particle Astrophysics (LeCosPA),
Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA),
and the Institute of Atomic and Molecular Sciences (IAMS).
The idea is to have excellent speakers to give inspiring, informative,
but non-technical talks on the frontiers of Sciences.

Enclosed below is the information of the Joint Colloquium on May 07.

Best regards,

Pisin Chen (LeCosPA)
Ting-Wai Chiu (NTU-Phys)
Michitoshi Hayashi (CCMS)
Lain-Jong Li (IAMS)
Michihiro Takami (ASIAA)

Abstract :
    The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer, AMS, is a general purpose particle physics detector in space. It was installed on the International Space Station on 19 May, 2011. The first AMS result is based on 25 billion cosmic ray events collected during the first 18 months of operation. A precision measurement of the positron fraction in primary cosmic rays in the range from 0.5 to 350 GeV is presented. The spectrum shows a steady increase of the positron ratio from 10 to ~250 GeV, with no observable structure or anisotropy.
    This talk will introduce the AMS detector and its operation in space, followed by details of the analysis towards the positron ratio measurement. Some implications of these new results are also discussed.
