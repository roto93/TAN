Topic:        Exoplanetary Science in Australia: Detection, Characterisation, and
Destruction
Time:        7/12 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
I give an update on three major exoplanetary science initiatives being
pursued by Australian-based planet-search teams.  Further observations
from the Anglo-Australian Planet Search (AAPS) have revealed that some
systems previously thought to contain a single, moderate-eccentricity
planet are better fit by two planets on nearly-circular orbits.  We have
investigated apparent single-planet systems to see if the available data
can be better fit by two lower-eccentricity planets.  We identify nine
promising candidate systems and perform detailed dynamical tests to
confirm the stability of the potential new multiple-planet systems.  In
addition to the AAPS, I describe the Pan-Pacific Planet Search, a
radial-velocity survey of Southern hemisphere evolved, intermediate-mass
stars using the 3.9m Anglo-Australian Telescope.  We currently achieve
velocity precisions of 3-6 m/s, and there are several planet candidates
emerging as more data are obtained.

I then describe a plan for Minerva: an installation of four 0.7m
telescopes feeding a high-resolution spectrograph, sited at Mt Hopkins
in Arizona.  Minerva will give exoplanetary scientists the ability to
pursue dedicated radial-velocity searches for planets orbiting the
nearest bright stars.  In addition, a Southern hemisphere Minerva could
be used to follow up on objects of interest from Antarctic telescopes
such as the Chinese AST-3.  I will describe the diverse science cases
for this highly cost-effective facility.

Finally, I present results from our recent series of papers in which we
have performed extensive suites of dynamical simulations to test the
veracity of proposed multiple-planet systems.  We show that some systems
are strongly constrained by protected low-order resonances, while others
are wildly unstable on short timescales.  This work highlights the
critical need to include dynamical stability analysis as an integral
part of the discovery process for candidate multi-planet systems.

Topic:        Search for Surviving Post-Impact Remnant Stars in Type Ia Supernova Remnants
Time:        7/9 (Tuesday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1108
Abstract:
The nature of the progenitor systems of Type Ia supernovae is still unclear. One way to distinguish between the SDS and DDS is to search for the surviving Post-Impact Remnant Stars (PIRSs). Using our stellar evolution simulations of main-sequence- (MS-) and helium-rich- (He-) PIRSs, we predict the color and magnitude of MS- and He-PIRSs as functions of time. We also discuss PIRS candidates in Galactic Type Ia supernova remnants (Ia SNRs), including SN 185, SN 1006, SN 1574, SN 1604, and G1.9+0.3, and nearby extragalactic Ia SNRs. We find that the maximum detectable distance of MS PIRSs (He PIRSs) is 0.6âˆ’4 Mpc (0.4 âˆ’ 16 Mpc), if the apparent magnitude limit is 27 and we assume no extinction, suggesting the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC/SMC) and the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) are excellent environments in which to search for PIRSs.
