Dear Colleagues,

You are cordially invited to attend the Joint Colloquium which will be held
on November 12 (

site:
http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~d01222003/Seminar3/Joint%20colloquia%20fall%202=
013.html
).

The Joint Colloquium Series is organized by the NTU Physics Department,
Center for Condensed Matter Science (CCMS), Leung Center for Cosmology and
Particle Astrophysics (LeCosPA), Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and
Astrophysics (ASIAA), and the Institute of Atomic and Molecular Sciences
(IAMS).

The idea is to have excellent speakers to give inspiring, informative, but
non-technical talks on the frontiers of Sciences.

Enclosed below is the information of the Joint Colloquium on November 12.

Best regards,

Yen-Ting Lin (ASIAA)
Michitoshi Hayashi (CCMS)
Lain-Jong Li (IAMS)
Jiwoo Nam (LeCosPA)
Juinn-Wei Chen (NTU-Phys)

ASIAA/CCMS/IAMS/LeCosPA/NTU-Physics Joint Colloquium

Speaker: Ue-Li Pen (=B4^=AB=C2=C2=A7 =B1=D0=B1=C2)

            (Associate Director, Canadian Institute for Theoretical
Astrophysics)

Topic : Astrophysical Tests of Quantum Gravity

Time  : 11/12 (Tue.) 14:20 - 15:20

Place : Room 104, CCMS-New Physics Building

Abstract:
I discuss possible observational consequences of quantum black holes. This
year, the first pulsar in orbit about a black hole was discovered. We argue
that some solutions to Hawking's information loss problem, for example
fuzzballs, may result in changes of lensed pulsar coherence, analogous to
the Aharonov-Bohm effect. We speculate on future experimental technologies
which may improve the observational prospects.

Brief Bio:
Prof. Pen is a world renown cosmologist, working on a wide variety of
topics ranging from cosmic string and topological defects,
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich simulations, gravitational lensing, cosmic reionization
and MHD simulations. He is also an expert on numerical simulation
techniques and parallel computing. He was a NTU undergrad in math, obtained
his PhD from Princeton University in 1995, and was a Harvard University
Junior Fellow before joining the faculty at the University of Toronto and
the Canadian Institute of Theoretical Astrophysics (CITA) in 1998. He is
currently a Canadian Institute for Advanced Research senior fellow and the
associate director of CITA. Recently his research is focused on
cosmological applications of the hydrogen hyperfine transition 21-cm line,
and pulsar scattering phenomena.
