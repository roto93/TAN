Arizona Radio Observatory: Call for Proposals (Spring 2013) 
------------------------------------------------------------ 

Dear all, 

Proposals from members of the University Consortium of ALMA-Taiwan and 
ASIAA, for observing time are being solicited for the period February 25, 
2013 ¡V June 15, 2013, at the Arizona Radio Observatory, for the Sub- 
Millimeter Telescope (SMT) and the Kitt Peak 12 Meter (12M). The proposal 
deadline of UCAT/ASIAA for this 2013 spring semester is set on February 21, 
2013 (Thursday). 

The SMT currently supports a dual-polarization, 1 mm receiver with ALMA Band- 
6 sideband-separating mixers, a dual-polarization 0.8 mm receiver, and a 0.4 
mm (602¡V720 GHz) dual-polarization receiver with ALMA Band-9 mixers. A new 
Band 8 (385¡V500 GHz) receiver will also be available for limited 
observations. The SMT control system has been updated to allow for dual 
polarization, dual sideband observations (so-called "4 IF mode"). The 12M 
supports a dual-polarization 3 mm receivers (82¡V116 GHz) that employs ALMA 
Band-3 sideboard-separating mixers, as well as dual polarization, single 
sideband receivers for the lower part of the 3 mm window (65-86 GHz) and at 
2 mm (130-180 GHz). Due to likely equipment upgrades, availability of the 12 
m may be limited. Remote observing is available at both ARO telescopes. 

Please refer to http://aro.as.arizona.edu/ for more details. Information 
about Remote Observing can be found at: 
http://aro.as.arizona.edu/remote/remote.htm. 
For further information about remote observing and other operational 
questions, please contact Tom Folkers, Operations Manager: 
tfolkers@email.arizona.edu 

Proposals should consist of: 
1. A proposal Cover Sheet, obtainable at http://aro.as.arizona.edu/proposals. 
2. A brief scientific and technical justification (no more than 2 pages). 
3. A source list with observing time requirements and justification, and/or 
tables, figures and references (no more than 1 page in total). Note Sun 
Avoidance Zones. 
4. Provide the IP number of the computer you will be using during your 
observations. 

Please pay special attention to the ¡§Sun Avoidance Zone¡¨ issue of your 
proposed observations. The SMT will not be pointed to within 42 degrees of 
the Sun, and the 12M, 15 degrees. 

Electronic submissions will be accepted in PDF format only. Scheduling of 
successful proposals will be done according to availability of the receivers 
requested. 
Please submit your proposals by midnight (23:59 pm CST) February 21, 2013 to: 
kuan AT asiaa.sinica.edu.tw. 

Kind regards, 
Yi-Jehng Kuan 
on behalf of UCAT's ARO TAC
