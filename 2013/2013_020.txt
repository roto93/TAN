*** Special Seminar
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Nicole Czakon (Caltech)
Topic:        The Bolocam Sunyaev-Zel'dovich(SZ) Observing Program: X-ray/SZ Scaling
Relations
Time:        2/4 (Monday) 15:00 - 16:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
Galaxy clusters have become promising probes of cosmology thanks to
recent advances in instrumentation.  Both galaxy cluster surveys and
pointed galaxy cluster observations provide insight into the nature of
dark energy and dark matter. A variety of physical phenomena generate
cluster observables which span from radio to X-ray. To use galaxy
clusters for cosmology, however, we must combine these different
wavelength observations, which scale independently with a cluster's
physical properties. One of these observables, the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich
(SZ) effect provides a lever arm to understand the baryonic content at
the outskirts of galaxy clusters. Caltech has contributed significantly
to the development of detectors and instrumentation to measure the
Sunyaev Zelâ€™dovich effect. The SZ observing program of one of the
instruments, Bolocam, has fully matured over the last year. Thanks in
large part to the ASIAA-branch of the CLASH program, our data has
contributed to a variety of cluster analyses. I will give an overview of
my work calibrating integrated SZ values with X-ray determined
masses. This work includes a detailed study of sources of systematic
error, including, selection function effects, large-scale signal
filtering, and alternative mass models. The full Bolocam X-ray SZ
catalog (BOXSZ) results are expected to be released early 2013.

Speaker:    Ching-Cheng Hsu (Laboratory for high energy physics, University of Bern)
Topic:        High Energy Particle Astrophysics with Cherenkov Telescopes
Time:        2/5 (Tuesday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
High Energy experimental particle astrophysics is now a field of growing interests and has been well established. It marks the intersection of astrophysics, particle physics and cosmology. In general, particle astrophysics has two main elements. One is multi-messenger astronomy and the other is fundamental physics with cosmic messengers. It opens new windows to the universe and provides us new approaches to understanding the fundamental properties of matter and the universe.  

The main focus of this talk is on the development of experimental techniques for Earth-bound Cherenkov gamma-ray and neutrino detectors. Consequently, more emphasis is given to the physics results from these experiments, particularly on the physics of Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) and related subjects. At last, the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) project which is a worldwide effort experiment on Tera-electronvolt gamma-ray astronomy in the next decade will be introduced. In addition, I will also discuss the prospective CTA physics impacts on AGN research.
