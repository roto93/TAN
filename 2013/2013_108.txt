Dear Colleagues,

You are cordially invited to attend the Joint Colloquium which will be held on June 11.
The Joint Colloquium Series is organized by
the NTU Physics Department, Center for Condensed Matter Science (CCMS),
Leung Center for Cosmology and Particle Astrophysics (LeCosPA),
Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA),
and the Institute of Atomic and Molecular Sciences (IAMS).
The idea is to have excellent speakers to give inspiring, informative,
but non-technical talks on the frontiers of Sciences.

Enclosed below is the information of the Joint Colloquium on June 11.

Best regards,

Pisin Chen (LeCosPA)
Ting-Wai Chiu (NTU-Phys)
Michitoshi Hayashi (CCMS)
Lain-Jong Li (IAMS)
Michihiro Takami (ASIAA)

        (Department of Physics,  NTHU)
Topic : Novel Geometry and Symmetry in String Theory
Time  : 06/11(Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:10

Abstract :
      Einstein theory of gravity is a classical theory and breaks down at places where spacetime curvature is huge. The incompleteness of Einstein gravity suggests that our current understanding of spacetime as a continuous manifold can only be an approximated one and should be replaced by something more fundamental at the quantum level. The currently favored candidate for a theory of quantum gravity is string theory. This is much more symmetrical than a particle-based theory. It unifies all forces and matter fields in a natural way, as modes of a single string. Moreover, because gravity is naturally incorporated and it is a promising candidate for a theory of quantum gravity. In this talk, I will first briefly explain what string theory is. Then I will focus on some of the novel aspects of geometry and symmetry in string theory which are thought to be relevant for the description of the quantum nature of spacetime.
