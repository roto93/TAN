Dear Colleagues,

You are cordially invited to attend the Joint Colloquium which will be held on April 30.
The Joint Colloquium Series is organized by
the NTU Physics Department, Center for Condensed Matter Science (CCMS),
Leung Center for Cosmology and Particle Astrophysics (LeCosPA),
Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA),
and the Institute of Atomic and Molecular Sciences (IAMS).
The idea is to have excellent speakers to give inspiring, informative,
but non-technical talks on the frontiers of Sciences.

Enclosed below is the information of the Joint Colloquium on April 30.

Best regards,

Pisin Chen (LeCosPA)
Ting-Wai Chiu (NTU-Phys)
Michitoshi Hayashi (CCMS)
Lain-Jong Li (IAMS)
Michihiro Takami (ASIAA)

Brief Bio. :
      Wei Lee earned his M.S. degree in electro-optical engineering from National Chiao Tung University (NCTU), Taiwan, in 1987 and his Ph.D. degree in physics from the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), AL, in 1993.  He was a lecturer in the Department of Physics at UAB from 1993 to 1994 and worked as a visiting assistant professor of physics and astronomy at the University of Toledo, OH, between 1994 and 1997. As a physics faculty member from August 1997 through January 2012, Dr. Lee was affiliated with Chung Yuan Christian University, Taiwan.  During this period of time, he took his sabbatical leave as a visiting professor of optics at CREOL, the College of Optics and Photonics of the University of Central Florida, FL, between 2009 and 2010, and a visiting scholar at the L. V. Kirensky Institute of Physics, Krasnoyarsk Scientific Center, Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Russia in 2010.  He is currently Director of the Institute of Imaging and Bi!
omedical Photonics, College of Photonics, National Chiao Tung University, Tainan Campus, Taiwan, and serves on the editorial board for the Optical Society (OSA) journal Optical Materials Express.


Abstract :
      Incorporating liquid crystal (LC) as a defect layer in a photonic crystal (PC) leads to the electrically tunable optical spectrum in defect modes within the photonic band gap.  Such a superior feature makes the hybrid structure potential for designing various types of optical devices.  Recently, we have demonstrated several types of photonic structures based on one-dimensional (1-D) PC containing memory-enabling LC (MELC) as a defect layer.  The optical state remains unchanged after removal of applied voltage in the memory state.  The defect modes of a PC/MELC cell can be switched to not only the dynamic or voltage-sustained states but the memory or optically stable states as well.  Owing to the fact that the spectral properties of defect modes in a memory state persist without applied voltage, the device will support the green society of tomorrow.  The wavelength tunability, amplitude tunability and optical multistability of the defect modes permit the 1-D PC/MELC cel!
l to be alluring for photonic device applications such as low-power-consumption multichannel filters, light shutters or electrically controllable intensity modulators without any polarizers.
      In this colloquium, I shall report on our recent development of various one-dimensional PC/LC hybrid cells for photonic applications.  Special attention will be paid to the optical and spectral properties of multilayer PC structures containing a bistable chiral-tilted homeotropic nematic (BHN) layer, a bistable chiral-splay nematic (BCSN), a bistable dual- frequency cholesteric LC (DF-CLC) layer, a tristable polymer-stabilized cholesteric texture (PSCT), and a tristable smectic-A liquid crystal as a defect lay
