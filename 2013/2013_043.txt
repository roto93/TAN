Dear Colleagues,

You are cordially invited to attend the Joint Colloquium which will be held on March 12 .
The Joint Colloquium Series is organized by
the NTU Physics Department, Center for Condensed Matter Science (CCMS),
Leung Center for Cosmology and Particle Astrophysics (LeCosPA),
Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA),
and the Institute of Atomic and Molecular Sciences (IAMS).
The idea is to have excellent speakers to give inspiring, informative,
but non-technical talks on the frontiers of Sciences.

Enclosed below is the information of the Joint Colloquium on March 12 .

Best regards,

Pisin Chen (LeCosPA)
Ting-Wai Chiu (NTU-Phys)
Michitoshi Hayashi (CCMS)
Lain-Jong Li (IAMS)
Michihiro Takami (ASIAA)

ASIAA/CCMS/IAMS/LeCosPA/NTU-Physics Joint Colloquium
Speaker: Professor  J邦rgen Kirschner
        (Director, Max-Planck-Institute for Microstructure Physics, Halle, Germany)
Topic : Experiments on the exchange-correlation hole in solids
Time  : 03/12 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:10
Place : Room 104, CCMS-New Physics Building

Brief Bio. :
    Born on April 18, 1945 in Arendsee (Altmark). Study of physics, doctorate Munich Technical Univ. (1974), scientific research at Forschungszentrum J邦lich, habilitation at RWTH Aachen (1982), Professor of Experimental Physics (C4 level) Free Univ. Berlin (1988), Director and Scientific Member at the Max Planck Institute of Microstructure Physics (since 1992), Full Professor University Halle-Wittenberg (1993). 

Abstract :
    The concept of the exchange-correlation hole (xc-hole) is fundamental to solid state physics. It was introduced in the early 1930ies by Wigner and Seitz and Slater, and postulates, that each electron in a solid is surrounded by a region of reduced electronic charge, adding up to exactly one electron charge. Thus, each such a ※dressed§ electron looks ※neutral§ to another one residing beyond a certain distance. This concept explained why electrons essentially behave like independent quasi-particles. Despite the success of this postulate it has never been directly tested experimentally for more than 70 years. In order to do this, one has to make a scattering experiment, which by the very nature of the dressed electrons will have a rather small cross section.
      We set up an (e,2e) experiment in which an electron (of some 10 eV kinetic energy) is sent to a sample, is elastically back reflected and on its way out may scatter with a valence electron. If the incident and the hit electron have sufficient energy to overcome the surface barrier they may be detected in vacuum in coincidence. For a given emission direction of the one electron the electron-electron interaction manifests itself in the angular distribution of the second electron around this direction. We made such experiments and found that there is a depletion zone for the second electron within an angular range of about 1 rad, essentially independent of its energy. We tested this for alkali halides as well as for Cu, and Fe. The cause of this effect is the mutual repulsion of electrons by exchange interaction and Coulomb repulsion. Thus, one may eventually map the xc-hole. In order to disentangle the contributions from correlation and exchange, one may work with a spin!
-polarized target and spin-polarized primary electrons. Such an experiment has been carried out recently /1/, using Fe as the target and a GaAs photocathode electron source. We find that the ※exchange hole§ is significantly larger than the ※correlation hole§.
