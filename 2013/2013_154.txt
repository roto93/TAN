Dear All,

I would like to bring to your attention that the deadline for CFHT 2014A proposals 
is approaching, and it is Sep 19th 07:59.

One thing I need to point out is that there will be a new "long-term" proposal category 
for CFHT-Taiwan.  People who would like to request multi-semester observations or 
large amount of observing time, will need to follow the long-term proposal guideline.
The guideline, along with the call for proposals, can be found:
http://oir.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/cfht/observations.php

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions on this.

Cheers,
Wei-Hao Wang
on behalf of the CFHT-Taiwan TAC
