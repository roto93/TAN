Topic:        Stellar Density Waves in M81
Time:        10/15 (Tuesday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1108
Abstract:
Aside from the grand-design stellar spirals appeared in the disk of M81, another pair of stellar spiral situated well inside the bright bulge of M81 are recently discovered by Kendall et al. (2008). The seemly unrelated two pairs of spirals pose a challenge to the theory of spiral density wave. In this work, a three-component model associated with a stellar disk, a bulge and a dark halo is first constructed as the basic state of M81 with the maximum contact with the observational constraints. We then apply the modal approach to the constructed model of M81 to look for discrete unstable spiral modes. We conclude that the seemly separated inner and outer spirals can be well explained by the presence of a single trailing spiral mode. They share the same pattern speed 25.5 km/s/kpc with the radius of corotation at 9.03 kpc. In addition to the good agreement in the spiral pattern, the variation of spiral amplitude can be also naturally reproduced within the framework of modal appr
oach.
