      Title: Greenland Telescope Project:
              Imaging the Shadow of the Black Hole

      Abstract:  ASIAA has officially acquired the 12m
      ALMA-NA Vertex Prototype Telescope in 2011.
      This telescope, now renamed as the "Greenland Telescope (GLT)",
      is going to be moved to the Summit Station in Greenland
      after upgrades. The first light of GLT at the Summit Station is
      expected to be available in 2017. Together with SMA and ALMA, the
      angular resolution of the submm VLBI system they formed will be only
      a few micro-arcseconds, providing an unique opportunity to observe
      the supermassive black hole in M87 on the event horizon. These
      observations will be extremely important for jet/accretion physics,
      as well as the general theory of relativity.

      In this talk, I will introduce the GLT project and introduce how to
      model the observed black hole "shadow" image. Such shadow (dark
      region) is expected to be observed when a black hole is
      surrounded by a bright source, such as an accretion disk.


Tea/Discussion Time is followed in the same room.

                  All Welcome !!

*** Colloquium
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Fred Adams (University of Michigan)
Topic:        Effects of Clusters on Star/Planet Formation and Possible Constraints on the Birth Environment of the Solar System
Time:        6/7 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
Most stars -- and hence most solar systems -- form within groups and
clusters.  The first objective of this talk is to explore how these
star forming environments affect solar systems forming within them.
The discussion starts with the dynamical evolution of young clusters
with N = 100 - 3000 members. We use N-body simulations to study how
evolution depends on system size and initial conditions.  Multiple
realizations of equivalent cases are used to build up a robust
statistical description of these systems, e.g., distributions of
closest approaches and radial locations.  These results provide a
framework from which to assess the effects of clusters on solar system
formation. Distributions of radial positions are used in conjunction
with UV luminosity distributions to estimate the radiation exposure of
circumstellar disks. Photoevaporation models determine the efficacy of
radiation in removing disk gas and compromising planet formation. The
distributions of closest approaches are used in conjunction with
scattering cross sections to determine probabilities for solar system
disruption. The result of this work is a quantitative determination of
the effects of clusters on forming solar systems. The second objective
of this talk is to use these results to place constraints on the
possible birth environments for our own solar system. These latter 
results are more uncertain than the first ones, but provide interesting 
perspectives on our place in the universe.

Dear Colleagues,

You are cordially invited to attend the Joint Colloquium which will be held on June 11.
The Joint Colloquium Series is organized by
the NTU Physics Department, Center for Condensed Matter Science (CCMS),
Leung Center for Cosmology and Particle Astrophysics (LeCosPA),
Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA),
and the Institute of Atomic and Molecular Sciences (IAMS).
The idea is to have excellent speakers to give inspiring, informative,
but non-technical talks on the frontiers of Sciences.

Enclosed below is the information of the Joint Colloquium on June 11.

Best regards,

Pisin Chen (LeCosPA)
Ting-Wai Chiu (NTU-Phys)
Michitoshi Hayashi (CCMS)
Lain-Jong Li (IAMS)
Michihiro Takami (ASIAA)

Speaker: Professor Chong-Sun Chu ($B<kAO?7(B $B65<x(B)
        (Department of Physics,  NTHU)
Topic : Novel Geometry and Symmetry in String Theory
Time  : 06/11(Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:10
Place : Room 104, CCMS-New Physics Building


Abstract :
      Einstein theory of gravity is a classical theory and breaks down at places where spacetime curvature is huge. The incompleteness of Einstein gravity suggests that our current understanding of spacetime as a continuous manifold can only be an approximated one and should be replaced by something more fundamental at the quantum level. The currently favored candidate for a theory of quantum gravity is string theory. This is much more symmetrical than a particle-based theory. It unifies all forces and matter fields in a natural way, as modes of a single string. Moreover, because gravity is naturally incorporated and it is a promising candidate for a theory of quantum gravity. In this talk, I will first briefly explain what string theory is. Then I will focus on some of the novel aspects of geometry and symmetry in string theory which are thought to be relevant for the description of the quantum nature of spacetime.
