Dear Colleagues,

You are cordially invited to attend the Joint Colloquium which will be held
on December 17 (http://web.phys.ntu.edu.tw/colloquium/).

The Joint Colloquium Series is organized by the NTU Physics Department,
Center for Condensed Matter Science (CCMS), Leung Center for Cosmology and
Particle Astrophysics (LeCosPA), Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and
Astrophysics (ASIAA), and the Institute of Atomic and Molecular Sciences
(IAMS).

The idea is to have excellent speakers to give inspiring, informative, but
non-technical talks on the frontiers of Sciences.

Enclosed below is the information of the Joint Colloquium on December 17.

Best regards,

Yen-Ting Lin (ASIAA)
Michitoshi Hayashi (CCMS)
Chia-Lung Hsieh (IAMS)
Jiwoo Nam (LeCosPA)
Juinn-Wei Chen (NTU-Phys)

ASIAA/CCMS/IAMS/LeCosPA/NTU-Physics Joint Colloquium

Speaker: Paul Nation

              (Korea University)

Topic :  *Exploring the Classical-Quantum Transition **Using Optomechanical
Systems*

Time  : 12/17 (Tue.) 14:20 - 15:20

Place : Room 104, CCMS-New Physics Building

Abstract:
    Understanding how the classical world emerges from the counterintuitive
rules of quantum mechanics has been one of the longstanding goals in
physics. Our intuition, and education, tells us that =E2=80=9Csmall=E2=80=
=9D objects such
as atoms behave quantum mechanically, while =E2=80=9Clarge=E2=80=9D everyda=
y things are
=EF=AC=81rmly grounded in the classical domain. However, is this insight co=
rrect?
Or is it possible to place a macroscopic object in a quantum mechanical
state? Theoretical work over the last two decades has answered this last
question a=EF=AC=83rmatively, provided that the ever present e=EF=AC=80ects=
of the
environment to which every object is coupled can be mitigated.
    Here we will explore the generation of macroscopic quantum states of a
mechanical resonator in an optomechanical setup. Making use of tools
developed in quantum optics, we show that quantum states of a mechanical
oscillator can be generated in an analogue of a micromaser, in absence of
any atom-like subsystem, thus exhibiting single-atom masing e=EF=AC=80ects =
in a
system composed solely of oscillator components. The connection to the
micromaser allows for a physical understanding of how nonclassical states
arise in this system, and how best to maximize these signatures for
experimental observation.

Brief Bio:
    Paul Nation is a theoretical physicist working on a multitude of
quantum physics related topics such superconducting circuit devices,
quantum optics, and computational methods for solving quantum dynamics. He
received his B.S. (2005) from Utah State University and Ph.D. (2010) from
Dartmouth College. He has held postdoctoral positions at the RIKEN Advanced
Science Institute in Tokyo, and the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor.
