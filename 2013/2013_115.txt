Topic:        The origin of wide binary star companions and wide planetary orbits
Time:        6/20 (Thursday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
Observations have revealed the presence of a significant population of wide (> 1000 AU) binary systems in the Galactic field and halo. In addition, planets in wide (> 100 AU) orbits have been detected. The origin of both of these populations is difficult to explain with theories of star formation and planet formation. We carry out N-body simulations of dissolving star clusters with a free-floating planet population, and show that dynamical capture processes can explain these wide orbits. Interestingly, the simulations also predict the existence of other peculiar systems, such as higher-order multiple systems, circumbinary planets, planets around black holes and white dwarfs, retrograde planetary orbits, and free-floating double planets.
