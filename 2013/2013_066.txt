*** Colloquium
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Matteo BarnabÃ¨ (Dark Cosmology Centre)
Topic:        The dark and luminous mass structure of lens galaxies
Time:        4/12 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
Understanding the formation and evolution processes of galaxies
remains among the most important unsolved problems in present-day
astrophysics and cosmology.
A reliable and detailed description of the mass-density profile and
structural properties of galaxies through cosmic time is a much-needed
step forward but â€“ whereas nearby systems have been thoroughly
analyzed â€“ painfully little is known about more distant objects, since
observational limitations make it difficult to employ the traditional
diagnostic tools.
During this talk I will describe a method to overcome these
difficulties based on combining in a self-consistent way the
information obtained from two independent and complementary
techniques: strong gravitational lensing and stellar dynamics. This
provides a robust way to conduct detailed studies of both elliptical
and disk galaxies beyond the local Universe.
I will then detail the results of the application of this method to
the analysis of a sample of 16 lens elliptical galaxies in the
redshift range z = 0.08 - 0.33, for which both HST imaging
observations and two-dimensional kinematic maps (obtained from VLT
VIMOS spectroscopical observations) are available.
I will also illustrate how this approach can be extended to study in
detail the dark and luminous mass structure of lens disk galaxies, and
to put firm constraints on the initial mass function of massive
galaxies.

Speaker:    Fred K. Y. Lo (NRAO)
Topic:        Mega-maser Cosmology Project
Time:        4/8 (Monday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
Better measurements of H0 - the current expansion rate of the Universe, provide critical independent constraints on dark energy, spatial curvature of the Universe, neutrino physics, and validity of general relativity. The Mega-maser Cosmology Project (MCP) aims to determine the Hubble Constant at high accuracy by measuring the angular-diameter distance to galaxies in the Hubble Flow. The MCP has discovered 9 new mega-maser disks in Sy2 nuclei suitable for distance determination. A geometric distance measurement to a galaxy at 140 Mpc, via micro- arc-second astrometry of its circum-nuclear mega-maser disk, has been demonstrated. The current status of the MCP measurements of Ho, and future prospects, will be described.

The MCP also enables accurate determination of the central black-hole mass in mega-maser galaxies.    The large intrinsic scatter of BH masses in a narrow range of the velocity dispersion in the mega-maser galaxy bulges raise questions about the validity of the well-known M-Ïƒ relation of BH mass and the spherical component of galaxies. The relationship of the thin Keplerian accretion disks delineated by the mega-masers with the obscuring material of the AGN will also be briefly discussed.

Timing permitting, other key projects at the NRAO will be also described.
