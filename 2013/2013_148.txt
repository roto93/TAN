Arizona Radio Observatory: Call for Proposals (Fall 2013)
------------------------------------------------------------
Dear Astronomers in Taiwan,

Observing proposals from members of the University Consortium of ALMA-Taiwan
(UCAT) and ASIAA for the 10-meter Sub-Millimeter Telescope (SMT), located on
Mount Graham, of the Arizona Radio Observatory (ARO) are being solicited for the
period October 15, 2013 - January 31, 2014. The proposal deadline of UCAT/ASIAA
for this 2013 fall semester is set on September 17, 2013 (Tuesday).

The SMT currently supports a dual-polarization, 1 mm receiver (215-280 GHz) with
ALMA Band 6 sideband-separating (SBS) mixers, a dual-polarization 0.8 mm
(320-370 GHz) receiver, and a 0.4 mm (602-720 GHz) dual-polarization receiver
with ALMA Band 9 mixers. A new 0.7 mm (420-500 GHz) dual-polarization receiver
incorporating sideband-separating mixers will be available as well. The SMT
control system supports both dual polarization ("2 IF mode"), and dual
polarization, dual sideband observations ("4 IF mode"), as well as OTF mapping.
Remote observing is available http://aro.as.arizona.edu/remote/remote.htm .
Graduate student participation is especially encouraged.

Proposals should consist of:
1. A proposal Cover Sheet, obtainable at http://aro.as.arizona.edu/proposals .
2. A brief scientific and technical justification (no more than 2 pages).
3. A source list with observing time requirements and justification, and/or
    tables, figures and references (no more than 1 page in total).
4. Observers that plan to observe remotely must supply fixed IP address(es) of
    the computer(s) that will be used during observing on the cover sheet of
    the proposal.

Proposers are required to list on the cover sheet their requested observing
blocks (LST ranges), dates which they are not available to observe, and dates in
which sources in those observing blocks are within the Sun Avoidance Zone (the
SMT will not be pointed to sources within 44 degrees from the Sun).

Proposers should consult the ARO website http://aro.as.arizona.edu/ for
technical specifications. For further information about remote observing and
other operational questions, contact Tom Folkers, Operations Manager
tfolkers@email.arizona.edu .

Electronic submissions will be accepted in PDF format only. Scheduling of
successful proposals will be done according to availability of the receivers
requested. The final proposal pdf file should be emailed to
kuan@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw by  midnight (23:59 pm CST) September 17, 2013.


Kind regards,
Yi-Jehng Kuan
on behalf of UCAT's ARO TAC
