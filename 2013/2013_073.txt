Dear Colleagues,

You are cordially invited to attend the Joint Colloquium which will be held on April 23 .
The Joint Colloquium Series is organized by
the NTU Physics Department, Center for Condensed Matter Science (CCMS),
Leung Center for Cosmology and Particle Astrophysics (LeCosPA),
Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA),
and the Institute of Atomic and Molecular Sciences (IAMS).
The idea is to have excellent speakers to give inspiring, informative,
but non-technical talks on the frontiers of Sciences.

Enclosed below is the information of the Joint Colloquium on April 23 .

Best regards,

Pisin Chen (LeCosPA)
Ting-Wai Chiu (NTU-Phys)
Michitoshi Hayashi (CCMS)
Lain-Jong Li (IAMS)
Michihiro Takami (ASIAA)

ASIAA/CCMS/IAMS/LeCosPA/NTU-Physics Joint Colloquium
Speaker: Professor RUDOLF SCHAEFER
        (Leibniz Institute for Solid State and Materials Research (IFW), Dresden, Germany)
Topic : Magneto-Optic Analysis of Magnetic Microstructures
Time  : 04/23(Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:10
Place : Room 104, CCMS-New Physics Building


Brief Bio. :
    Rudolf Schaefer received the diploma degree in Materials Science and the Ph.D. degree in Engineering from the University of Erlangen-Nuernberg (Germany) in 1985 and 1990, respectively. He then joined the IBM Research Center in Yorktown Heights (USA) and the Forschungszentrum Juelich (Germany) as a Postdoc in 1991 and 1992, respectively. In 1993 Rudolf Schaefer moved to the IFW Dresden (now the Leibniz Institute for Solid State and Materials Research Dresden, Germany) where he became head of the department "Magnetic Microstructures" in 2002. In 2011, Dr. Schaefer was appointed honorary professor for Magnetic Materials at the Institute for Materials Science at Technical University Dresden. His areas of interest span magnetic materials with a focus on magnetic microstructures and domain imaging by Kerr microscopy. He has published more than 130 technical articles in peer-reviewed journals, including book chapters, and together with Alex Hubert he has coauthored the textboo!
k "Magnetic Domains". Prof. Schaefer currently chairs the technical committee for "Magnetic Imaging" of the IEEE Society


Abstract :
      The rich world of magnetic microstructure or magnetic domains, extending from visible dimensions down to the nano-scale, forms the mesoscopic link between the fundamental physical properties of a magnetic material and its macroscopic properties and technical applications, which range from films for computer storage technology to magnetic cores for electrical machinery. Hysteresis phenomena, energy loss in inductive devices, noise in sensors, or the magnetoresistive properties of modern spintronic devices can be decisively determined by the peculiarities of the underlying magnetic microstructure, especially by irreversibilities in the magnetization process. Therefore any development and optimization of magnetic materials, which is usually accompanied by the measurement of magnetization curves, requires an understanding of the underlying domains and their reaction to magnetic fields, which, in most cases, can only be gained by direct imaging. 
      The presentation will address different aspects of magnetic microstructure adapted, where possible, to the interest of the audience and supported by domain observation using Kerr microscopy. This may include domains and magnetization processes in bulk magnetic material like oriented and non-oriented electrical steel, amorphous and nanocrystalline ribbons or permanent magnets, as well as thin films and multilayers. Fast magnetization processes can also be considered. Most challenging is the analysis of hidden (internal) domains and processes in bulk material. They are relevant for material performance and their analysis requires surface imaging in combination with domain modeling and some volume-sensitive imaging method. Aside from their scientific and technical relevance, magnetic microstructures are also aesthetically appealing, an aspect that will be part of the presentation.
