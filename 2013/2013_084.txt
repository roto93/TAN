                    NTHU
              Astronomy Colloquium
#############################################

        2:20 p.m. 10th May 2013 (Friday)
          NTHU Physics Building, Rm620

        Speaker: Prof. Chow-Choong Ngeow
                (National Central University)

        Title: Classical Cepheids Beyond Classical Regime
              -- Longer Wavelength, Longer Periods
                  and Larger Projection Factors

        Abstract: In this talk, I will present new directions
        of Cepheid research emerged in recent years.  An
        on-going search of ultra-long period Cepheids (ULPCs)
        in M31 using PTF data is highlighted. Finally, I will
        ended my talk with the recent investigation of
        projection factor (p-factor) -- an important parameter
        when calibrating the PL relation using
        Baade-Wesselink (BW) type technique. The value
        of p-factor was found to be larger than the
        previous adopted, which could have impact on
        the derived Hubble constant via the Cepheid PL
        relations calibrated with BW methods.

  Tea/Discussion Time is followed in the same room.

                  All Welcome !!
