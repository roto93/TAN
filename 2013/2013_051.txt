Dear Colleagues,

You are cordially invited to attend the Joint Colloquium which will be held on March 19.
The Joint Colloquium Series is organized by
the NTU Physics Department, Center for Condensed Matter Science (CCMS),
Leung Center for Cosmology and Particle Astrophysics (LeCosPA),
Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA),
and the Institute of Atomic and Molecular Sciences (IAMS).
The idea is to have excellent speakers to give inspiring, informative,
but non-technical talks on the frontiers of Sciences.

Enclosed below is the information of the Joint Colloquium on March 19.
Best regards,

Pisin Chen (LeCosPA)
Ting-Wai Chiu (NTU-Phys)
Michitoshi Hayashi (CCMS)
Lain-Jong Li (IAMS)
Michihiro Takami (ASIAA)

ASIAA/CCMS/IAMS/LeCosPA/NTU-Physics Joint Colloquium
Speaker: Professor  Teruaki Suyama
        (Research Center for the Early Universe (RESCEU), The University of Tokyo)
Topic : Origin of the inhomogeneous structures of the universe
Time  : 03/12 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:10
Place : Room 104, CCMS-New Physics Building

Brief Bio. :
    Teruaki Suyama is currently an assistant professor and works at the Research Center for the Early Universe (RESCEU), The University of Tokyo. He is primarily working on the early universe by means of the theoretical physics. Born in Japan, he received Ph.D at Kyoto University in 2007. He worked at the Institute for Cosmic Ray Research (ICRR), The University of Tokyo (2007-2008), then at Centre for Cosmology, Particle Physics and Phenomenology, The University catholic de Louvain (2008-2010), then RESCEU.

Abstract :
    How our universe evolved since its beginning into what it is today? What is the ultimate origin of the inhomogeneous structures such as galaxies and stars? Inflation, which is thought to have happened in the very early universe and has become a standard paradigm of cosmology, predicts that the inhomogeneities are generated from the quantum field fluctuations. Many theoretical models have been proposed to convert such field fluctuations to the earliest observable inhomogeneities in the sky, i.e. the temperature anisotropies of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). I will review some representative theoretical models of generation of the inhomogeneities within the inflationary paradigm. Then, I will discuss how different models predict different observational signatures in the CMB, particularly focusing on the statistics of the anisotropies of the CMB which are now becoming powerful observables to constrain the theoretical models. I will also touch the current situation !
of to what extent the observations can distinguish and exclude the proposed models of the early universe.

*** Colloquium
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Neal Dalal (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign)
Topic:        Probing dark matter substructure with dusty galaxies
Time:        3/22 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
The abundance of dark matter substructure in the halos of ordinary galaxies is sensitive to both the physics of dark matter and the physics of inflation in the early universe.  Strong gravitational lensing provides one of the only probes of the abundance of DM halo substructure, but existing constraints on substructure from lensing have been weak because of the small sample sizes available.  I will describe how the advent of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) has opened a new window onto DM substructure.  Large numbers of lensed, dusty star-forming galaxies at high redshift have been discovered by Herschel and the South Pole Telescope, and ALMA observations of these lensed systems will allow reconstruction of the mass distributions of the lensing galaxies with unprecedented resolution.  I will describe early results from this program, and I will discuss forecasts for ALMA as a probe of the properties of dark matter.


*** Special Seminar
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Zhi-Yun Li (University of Virginia)
Topic:        Magnetic Braking and Protostellar Disk Formation
Time:        3/21 (Thursday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
The formation of stars and planets are connected through disks. Disk formation, once thought to be a trivial consequence of angular momentum conservation, is greatly complicated by the magnetic field that is observed to be present in the dense, star-forming cores of molecular clouds. Indeed, in the simplest case of perfect coupling between the magnetic field and bulk neutral core material (the ideal MHD limit), both analytic work and numerical simulations
have shown that the formation of rotationally supported disks is suppressed by excessive magnetic braking in dense cores magnetized to the observed level, leading to the so-called ``magnetic braking catastrophe'' in disk formation. I will discuss possible resolutions
to this fundamental problem, including non-ideal MHD effects, misalignment between
the magnetic field and rotation axis, turbulence-enhanced magnetic reconnection, and outflow stripping of the slowly rotating protostellar envelope. How protostellar disks form and grow remains an open question.
