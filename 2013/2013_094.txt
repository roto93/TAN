Dear Colleagues,

You are cordially invited to attend the Joint Colloquium which will be held on May 21 .
The Joint Colloquium Series is organized by
the NTU Physics Department, Center for Condensed Matter Science (CCMS),
Leung Center for Cosmology and Particle Astrophysics (LeCosPA),
Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA),
and the Institute of Atomic and Molecular Sciences (IAMS).
The idea is to have excellent speakers to give inspiring, informative,
but non-technical talks on the frontiers of Sciences.

Enclosed below is the information of the Joint Colloquium on May 21.

Best regards,

Pisin Chen (LeCosPA)
Ting-Wai Chiu (NTU-Phys)
Michitoshi Hayashi (CCMS)
Lain-Jong Li (IAMS)
Michihiro Takami (ASIAA)

ASIAA/CCMS/IAMS/LeCosPA/NTU-Physics Joint Colloquium
Speaker: Professor  J. Raynien Kwo 
        (Department of physics, National Tsing Hua University)
Topic : Emergent low power technology:  From III-V nanoelectronics to spin currentronics
Time  : 05/21(Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:10
Place : Room 104, CCMS-New Physics Building


Abstract :

    As driven by continual demands of enhanced-transport in channels and reducing power dissipation to push for the ultimate CMOS, new materials and novel device physics are playing a critical role. High carrier mobility channel materials based on IIIâ€“V compounds and Ge are now the viable solutions. This talk gives an overview on extensive efforts undertaken in realization of inversion-channel high ð�œ¿/InGaAs MOSFET as an imminent technology. The engineering of this key high ð�œ¿/InGaAs interface on the atomic level has led to resolving the long-standing puzzle of the interplay between interfacial structures and electronic properties. Record-high device electrical performances have been demonstrated in the self-aligned inversion-channel InGaAs MOSFETs. 
    Looking ahead, a number of alternative technology candidates have emerged on the horizon. For spintronic research, the talk also covers recent progresses made in generating pure spin currents for low dissipation spin transport. 


Brief Bio. :
      Prof. J. Raynien Kwo is currently the Distinguished Chair Professor in the department of physics, National Tsing Hua University (NTHU).  Raynien received her BS degree from the Physics Department of NTU in 1975, and went to US to pursue the graduate study in Stanford University, CA. After obtaining her PhD in Applied Physics in 1981, she joined Bell Labs, Physics Research Division in Murray Hill, New Jersey as a member of technical staff, and later became a distinguished member of the technical staff in 2001. In 2003 she returned to Taiwan to promote higher education and advanced research for physics in her native land.  She directed the NTHU Physics Department as the Chair during 2005-2008, and led the Taiwan Physical Society as the President in 2008-2009.  She was the Director of the Center for the Condensed Matter Sciences in NTU (2010-2012). 
      Prof. Kwo is internationally well known for her outstanding research in novel electronic materials invented by advanced thin film fabrication techniques, especially for her pioneering work that laid the foundation for the field of artificial magnetic superlattices during the mid 80â€™s. With her pioneer work in metal molecular beam epitaxy, she discovered long-range antiferromagnetic coupling mediated in synthetic rare-earth magnetic superlattices, as identified to be the fundamental mechanism responsible for the giant magneto-resistance effect awarded with the Physics Nobel Prize in 2007. Later, in the field of high temperature superconducting films, she was the first to invent the oxide molecular-beam epitaxy to produce single crystalline HTSC films crucial for fundamental studies of anisotropic normal state properties. In her recent research on â€œoxide electronicsâ€�, she spearheaded the development of alternative high-k gate dielectrics for Si CMOS beyond 45 nm n!
ode. She also co-invented new high-k dielectrics including a mixed oxide Ga_2O_3(Gd_2O_3) and a binary oxide Gd_2O_3 to unpin the Fermi level of the III-V InGaAs semiconductor surface for the first time, vital for the realization of InGaAs MOSFETs.
