Dear Colleagues,

You are cordially invited to attend the Joint Colloquium which will be held on April 16 .
The Joint Colloquium Series is organized by
the NTU Physics Department, Center for Condensed Matter Science (CCMS),
Leung Center for Cosmology and Particle Astrophysics (LeCosPA),
Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA),
and the Institute of Atomic and Molecular Sciences (IAMS).
The idea is to have excellent speakers to give inspiring, informative,
but non-technical talks on the frontiers of Sciences.

Enclosed below is the information of the Joint Colloquium on April 16 .

Best regards,

Pisin Chen (LeCosPA)
Ting-Wai Chiu (NTU-Phys)
Michitoshi Hayashi (CCMS)
Lain-Jong Li (IAMS)
Michihiro Takami (ASIAA)

ASIAA/CCMS/IAMS/LeCosPA/NTU-Physics Joint Colloquium
Speaker: Ting-Kuo Lee (李定國)
        (Distinguished Research Fellow and Director, Institute of Physics, Academia Sinica)
Topic : Unexpected physical properties of high temperature superconductors 
Time  : 04/16 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:10
Place : Room 104, CCMS-New Physics Building


Abstract :
    Since the discovery of high temperature superconductors, it has been demonstrated again and again that whenever better samples are prepared and more sophisticated and higher accuracy measurements are used, there is always a new surprise, for example: s-wave paring is changed to d-wave pairing, spin-gap, Fermi arc and pseudogap, dichotomy of nodal and antinodal regions, inhomogeneous states like stripes and checker board,  large distribution of gap magnitudes, two gaps in superconducting state, Fermi surface pockets, time reversal symmetry broken without breaking translational symmetry,  phase fluctuation vs. Gaussian fluctuation, etc.. In this talk, I shall speculate the reason for this complexity in cuprates based on our understanding of the solutions of the t-J model. In particular I shall use our recent works on stripes and phase fluctuation as examples.

      Title:  Comet 103P/Hartley 2
      Abstract:
Comet 103P/Hartley 2 was the target for the extended mission of
NASA's Deep Impact spacecraft, called EPOXI,蟵fter the impact
experiment at comet 9P/Tempel 1 on July 4, 2005. The EPOXI flyby
observations at a closest distance of 694 km on November 4, 2010,
brought a wealth of information on the outgassing activity, shape and
surface structure of this small Jupiter family comet (A'Hearn et al.
2011). For example, the strong outflows of the CO2-rich jet from the
sun-lit end of the bowling-pin shaped and the H2O-rich jet in the
waist region came as a surprise. How would they be connected to the
large-scale jet structures observed in the coma? How would the
outgassing process be modulated by the rotation of the comet nucleus
Here, I'm going to present theain campaign results of comet
103P/Hartley 2.

    Tea/Discussion Time is followed in the same room.

                  All Welcome !!

  Astronomical Society of the Republic of China 2013 Scientific Assembly
                            (ASROC2013)

      National Penghu University of Science and Technology, Penghu
                            May 24 - 26, 2013

Second Circular
_______________

ASROC2013, the 2013 Scientific Assembly of the Astronomical Society of the
Republic of China, will be held at National Penghu University of Science and
Technology on May 24-26 (Fri-Sun). This is the annual event for all astronomers
and astrophysicists in Taiwan to report their latest results and to exchange
new ideas. ASROC2013 is an excellent venue, too, for graduate students to
present their research findings and/or progress from thesis studies.

    Besides scientific and educational sessions, poster presentations, and
a business meeting, ASROC2013 will also include two plenary talks:
"Probing Strong Gravity with Accreting Black Holes" (on May 25) given by the
former President of the Royal Astronomical Society and a Fellow of the Royal
Society, Prof. Andrew Fabian of University of Cambridge, and "The Search for
Life in the Universe" (on May 26) by Dr. Donald Goldsmith, the winner of the
Annenberg Award of American Astronomical Society in astronomy education, and
the Dorothea Klumpke-Roberts Award of Astronomical Society of the Pacific in
popularization of astronomy, respectively.

        In addition to the scientific agenda, a half-day free time is reserved
for group discussion or group excursions at choice in the afternoon of May 25
(Sat); a conference banquet will be held later in the evening and all meeting
participants are welcome to attend (please refer to
http://www.asroc.org.tw/asroc2013/en/tourbanquet.php for more details).
During the meeting, exhibitions of astronomical books and instruments, portable
telescopes are also planned.  Given the meeting date overlap the annual Penghu
Firework Festival, participants of ASROC2013 are strongly encouraged to make
travel arrangements and hotel booking as early as possible. (Please refer to
http://www.asroc.org.tw/asroc2013/en/travelNAccom.php#travel for more details.)

    ASROC2013 website has been online since January 16; participants of the
scientific assembly should submit their abstracts and register online. The
abstract submission deadline is March 31, and the on-line registration deadline
is April 15. A registration fee of NT$500 should be paid on site. For more
detailed information and update, please visit the ASROC website at
http://www.asroc.org.tw/asroc2013/en/index.php .
