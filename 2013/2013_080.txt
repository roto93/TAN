      Title:  Stochastically Fueling the AGN Dust Toroid vis
              Highly Turbulent Gas Streams ?
      Abstract:
I will present the Green Bank 100m Telescope mapping
observations of CS 1-0, and the SMA 157-pointings mosaic of the
submillimeter dust continuum emission as well as several warm and
dense gas tracers, in the central ~20 pc area in Galactic Center.

These observations resolved several filamentary gas streams which
follow highly eccentric Keplerian orbits around the central
supermassive black hole (SMBH) Sgr A* and the 2-4 pc scale
circumnuclear disk (CND). Some of these gas streams appear to be
well connected with the CND. Rather than being a quasi-stationary
structure, the CND may be dynamically evolving, incorporating the
inflow via exterior gas streams, and feeding gas toward the center.


    Tea/Discussion Time is followed in the same room.

Dear Colleagues,

You are cordially invited to attend the Joint Colloquium which will be held on April 30.
The Joint Colloquium Series is organized by
the NTU Physics Department, Center for Condensed Matter Science (CCMS),
Leung Center for Cosmology and Particle Astrophysics (LeCosPA),
Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA),
and the Institute of Atomic and Molecular Sciences (IAMS).
The idea is to have excellent speakers to give inspiring, informative,
but non-technical talks on the frontiers of Sciences.

Enclosed below is the information of the Joint Colloquium on April 30.

Best regards,

Pisin Chen (LeCosPA)
Ting-Wai Chiu (NTU-Phys)
Michitoshi Hayashi (CCMS)
Lain-Jong Li (IAMS)
Michihiro Takami (ASIAA)

ASIAA/CCMS/IAMS/LeCosPA/NTU-Physics Joint Colloquium
Speaker: Professor Wei Lee (李偉 教授)
        (College of Photonics National Chiao Tung University)
Topic : One-dimensional photonic crystals containing memory-enabling liquid-crystal defect layers
Time  : 04/30(Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:10
Place : Room 104, CCMS-New Physics Building


Brief Bio. :
      Wei Lee earned his M.S. degree in electro-optical engineering from National Chiao Tung University (NCTU), Taiwan, in 1987 and his Ph.D. degree in physics from the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), AL, in 1993.  He was a lecturer in the Department of Physics at UAB from 1993 to 1994 and worked as a visiting assistant professor of physics and astronomy at the University of Toledo, OH, between 1994 and 1997. As a physics faculty member from August 1997 through January 2012, Dr. Lee was affiliated with Chung Yuan Christian University, Taiwan.  During this period of time, he took his sabbatical leave as a visiting professor of optics at CREOL, the College of Optics and Photonics of the University of Central Florida, FL, between 2009 and 2010, and a visiting scholar at the L. V. Kirensky Institute of Physics, Krasnoyarsk Scientific Center, Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Russia in 2010.  He is currently Director of the Institute of Imaging and Bi!
omedical Photonics, College of Photonics, National Chiao Tung University, Tainan Campus, Taiwan, and serves on the editorial board for the Optical Society (OSA) journal Optical Materials Express.


Abstract :
      Incorporating liquid crystal (LC) as a defect layer in a photonic crystal (PC) leads to the electrically tunable optical spectrum in defect modes within the photonic band gap.  Such a superior feature makes the hybrid structure potential for designing various types of optical devices.  Recently, we have demonstrated several types of photonic structures based on one-dimensional (1-D) PC containing memory-enabling LC (MELC) as a defect layer.  The optical state remains unchanged after removal of applied voltage in the memory state.  The defect modes of a PC/MELC cell can be switched to not only the dynamic or voltage-sustained states but the memory or optically stable states as well.  Owing to the fact that the spectral properties of defect modes in a memory state persist without applied voltage, the device will support the green society of tomorrow.  The wavelength tunability, amplitude tunability and optical multistability of the defect modes permit the 1-D PC/MELC cel!
l to be alluring for photonic device applications such as low-power-consumption multichannel filters, light shutters or electrically controllable intensity modulators without any polarizers.
      In this colloquium, I shall report on our recent development of various one-dimensional PC/LC hybrid cells for photonic applications.  Special attention will be paid to the optical and spectral properties of multilayer PC structures containing a bistable chiral-tilted homeotropic nematic (BHN) layer, a bistable chiral-splay nematic (BCSN), a bistable dual- frequency cholesteric LC (DF-CLC) layer, a tristable polymer-stabilized cholesteric texture (PSCT), and a tristable smectic-A liquid crystal as a defect lay

*** Colloquium

Speaker:    Chow-Choong Ngeow (NCU)
Topic:        Classical Cepheids Beyond Classical Regime -- Longer Wavelength, Longer Periods and Larger Projection Factors
Time:        5/3 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
Classical Cepheids are an important component in extra-galactic distance scale work, as its famous period-luminosity (PL) relation can be used to derive the Hubble constant via the calibration of various secondary distance indicators. Boosted by the HST H0 Key Project, past works on Classical Cepheids have been focused on the investigation of long period Cepheids (with pulsation periods from 10 to 60 days) in the V and I bands. One such example is the extensive calibration of VI band PL relations in literature. In this talk, I will present new directions of Cepheid research emerged in recent years. The first one is the moving of the calibration of PL relation from optical to mid-infrared (MIR). The biggest advantage of using the MIR PL relations is the extinction is negligible in these wavelengths, at which extinction is one of main systematic errors in Cepheid distance (hence propagated to the errors for Hubble constant). The MIR PL relations also hold the promise to derive!
  Hubble constant with 2-3% accuracy in near future. The second direction is the investigation of Cepheids with periods longer than 80 days, the so-called ultra-long period Cepheids (ULPCs). These ULPCs are ignored in the past, however Bird et al (2009) proposed they can reach to a distance of 100Mpc, well beyond the ~40Mpc distance based on shorter period Cepheids using HST. An on-going search of ULPCs in M31 using PTF data is highlighted in this talk. Finally, I will ended my talk with the recent investigation of projection factor (p-factor) -- an important parameter when calibrating the PL relation using Baade-Wesselink (BW) type technique. The value of p-factor was found to be larger than the previous adopted, which could have impact on the derived Hubble constant via the Cepheid PL relations calibrated with BW methods.
