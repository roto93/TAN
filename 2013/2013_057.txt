Dear Colleagues,

You are cordially invited to attend the Joint Colloquium which will be held on March 26.
The Joint Colloquium Series is organized by
the NTU Physics Department, Center for Condensed Matter Science (CCMS),
Leung Center for Cosmology and Particle Astrophysics (LeCosPA),
Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA),
and the Institute of Atomic and Molecular Sciences (IAMS).
The idea is to have excellent speakers to give inspiring, informative,
but non-technical talks on the frontiers of Sciences.

Enclosed below is the information of the Joint Colloquium on March 26.
Best regards,

Pisin Chen (LeCosPA)
Ting-Wai Chiu (NTU-Phys)
Michitoshi Hayashi (CCMS)
Lain-Jong Li (IAMS)
Michihiro Takami (ASIAA)

ASIAA/CCMS/IAMS/LeCosPA/NTU-Physics Joint Colloquium
Speaker: Professor  Chen-Yuan Dong
        (Department of Physics, NTU)
Topic : Advances in Nonlinear Optical Microscopy for Biophysical Research
Time  : 03/26 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:10
Place : Room 104, CCMS-New Physics Building


Abstract :
    Advances in nonlinear optics and microscopy techniques have contributed significantly to research in biological systems. Not only can imaging through the use of techniques such as multiphoton excitation and harmonic generation provided a wealth of information on biophysical phenomena, femtosecond laser assisted photoablation can also be used to process biological systems on the micron scale. In this presentation, I will discuss the recent development of nonlinear techniques and present examples from our laboratory in which the relevant methodology can be used to advance the study of in vivo biophysics. Future developments and impacts of our studies for biomedical research will be discussed.

> OBJECTIVES:
> This series of Cosmic Dust meetings aims at finding a consensus among
experts on the formation and evolution of cosmic dust: where it comes from
and where it goes. The meeting is organized by dust freaks who are very
enthusiastic not only to make the goal achievable but also to establish a
dust community across every scientifically relevant discipline for the
development of cosmic dust research. For this reason, the primary
objectives of the meeting are to bring together professionals who deal with
cosmic dust and to provide an opportunity for participants to develop human
relations and interactions between the participants.
>
> SCOPE:
> All kinds of cosmic dust such as
> � intergalactic dust
> � interstellar dust
> � protoplanetary disk dust
> � debris disk dust
> � cometary dust
> � asteroidal dust
> � interplanetary dust
> � circumplanetary dust
> � stellar nebular condensates
> � presolar grains
> � micrometeorites
> � meteoroids
> � meteors
> � regolith particles
> � planetary aerosols
> are the subject of discussion. The meeting is open for any aspects of
dust research by means of different methods of studies (in-situ and
laboratory measurements, astronomical observations, laboratory and
numerical analogue simulations, theoretical modeling, data analyses, etc.).
All dust-related topics, for example, the formation of molecules and their
reactions on and their desorption from the surface of dust particles, are
also welcome. Publishing the proceedings of this meeting is currently being
planned as a special issue of a peer-reviewed journal, while paper
submission to the proceedings is not obligatory.

> ADMISSIONS APPLICATION:
> Please complete online meeting application at the CPS website in order to
attend the meeting (deadline: May 13, 2013, 11:59 p.m. Japan Standard
Time). Because the number of participants shall be limited, the online

notified of the admissions decision by May 31, 2013. Priority will be given
to those who contribute to oral or poster sessions and retain enthusiasm
for discussions throughout the meeting. For further details, please visit
the Cosmic Dust website.

> REGISTRATION FEE:
> While no payment is required at the time of admissions application and
abstract submission, a registration fee of 10,000 JPY should be paid by
cash on arrival at the venue. No matter what circumstances are specified,
the registration fee will not be waived.

> BRIEF HISTORY:
> The Cosmic Dust meeting started in 2006 as a session called 鏠osmic Dust�
of the 3rd AOGS (Asia-Oceania Geoscience Society) annual meeting in
Singapore. Dust freaks have kept on organizing the session at subsequent
AOGS meetings in Korea (2008), India (2010), and Taiwan (2011). The Cosmic
Dust series has been recognized as the most successful session of the AOGS
Planetary Sciences Section. In 2012, the time was ripe to be free from
organizing restrictions on the AOGS meeting. From that time on, the Cosmic
Dust meeting is totally independent of any international conference. The
past meetings on Cosmic Dust have been held in a relaxed and joyful
atmosphere. So will be the coming one!
