Dear Colleagues,

You are cordially invited to attend the Joint Colloquium which will be held
on October 22.

The Joint Colloquium Series is organized by the NTU Physics Department,
Center for Condensed Matter Science (CCMS), Leung Center for Cosmology and
Particle Astrophysics (LeCosPA), Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and
Astrophysics (ASIAA), and the Institute of Atomic and Molecular Sciences
(IAMS).

The idea is to have excellent speakers to give inspiring, informative, but
non-technical talks on the frontiers of Sciences.

Enclosed below is the information of the Joint Colloquium on October 22.

Best regards,

Yen-Ting Lin (ASIAA)
Michitoshi Hayashi (CCMS)
Lain-Jong Li (IAMS)
Jiwoo Nam (LeCosPA)
Juinn-Wei Chen (NTU-Phys)

ASIAA/CCMS/IAMS/LeCosPA/NTU-Physics Joint Colloquium

Speaker: Prof George Wei-Shu Hou (=ABJ=BA=FB=AE=A4 =B1=D0=B1=C2)

            (Dept. of Physics, National Taiwain University)

Topic : a Higgstory --- Special Colloquium on the 2013 Nobel Prize in
Physics

Time  : 10/22 (Tue.) 14:20 - 15:10

Place : Room 104, CCMS-New Physics Building

Abstract:
  History has it that a Higgs boson was discovered through the gluon-gluon
fusion process in high energy p-p collisions that, by all counts so far,
confirms theoretical prediction. With the 2013 Physics Nobel Prize awarded
to Englert and Higgs, we trace the backdrop in the early 1960s, how the
separate groups of antagonists were led to propose the now awarded
mechanism that allow gauge bosons to become massive through
spontaneous symmetry breaking, how the hunting started with the
emergence of the Standard Model, culminating in the discovery last year
by the gigantic experiments called ATLAS and CMS, operating at the CERN
LHC. Anecdotes would be splattered throughout.
