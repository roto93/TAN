Topic:        The shape of galaxy evolution - Morphology in the age of Galaxy Zoo
Time:        10/30 (Wednesday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
Despite the advent of large surveys, morphology remains an important diagnostic for studies of galaxy evolution and formation. Since 2007, the Galaxy Zoo project (http://www.galaxyzoo.org) has collected more than 250 million independent classifications of galaxies from both the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and large Hubble Space Telescope surveys, and in this seminar project Principle Investigator Chris Lintott will review the results, emphasizing the use of morphology to distinguish between secular and merger-driven evolution. Unusual objects discovered by Galaxy Zoo such as Hanny's Voorwerp, a quasar light-echo, have also provided a chance to study the evolution of AGN almost as it happens.

Topic:        The Onset of Molecular Gas:  CO Intensity Mapping
Time:        10/29 (Tuesday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
Molecular gas is a poorly understood but vital component of galaxy evolution.  New tools such as ALMA and EVLA are making impressive characterizations of the gas in the most massive galaxies at high redshift.  But lower mass galaxies, which ultimately evolve into galaxies like the Milky Way, are undetectable through individual pointings.  Intensity mapping, or the detection of aggregate emission of large angular scales, is a powerful tool for characterizing the molecular gas in low mass galaxies.  I will describe our campaign using data from the SZA to detect CO at z=3 and our plans to detect molecular gas to greater redshift using the SZA, AMiBA, and new instruments.
