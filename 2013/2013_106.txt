Topic:        Effects of Clusters on Star/Planet Formation and Possible Constraints on the Birth Environment of the Solar System
Time:        6/7 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
Most stars -- and hence most solar systems -- form within groups and
clusters.  The first objective of this talk is to explore how these
star forming environments affect solar systems forming within them.
The discussion starts with the dynamical evolution of young clusters
with N = 100 - 3000 members. We use N-body simulations to study how
evolution depends on system size and initial conditions.  Multiple
realizations of equivalent cases are used to build up a robust
statistical description of these systems, e.g., distributions of
closest approaches and radial locations.  These results provide a
framework from which to assess the effects of clusters on solar system
formation. Distributions of radial positions are used in conjunction
with UV luminosity distributions to estimate the radiation exposure of
circumstellar disks. Photoevaporation models determine the efficacy of
radiation in removing disk gas and compromising planet formation. The
distributions of closest approaches are used in conjunction with
scattering cross sections to determine probabilities for solar system
disruption. The result of this work is a quantitative determination of
the effects of clusters on forming solar systems. The second objective
of this talk is to use these results to place constraints on the
possible birth environments for our own solar system. These latter 
results are more uncertain than the first ones, but provide interesting 
perspectives on our place in the universe.
