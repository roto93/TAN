*** Colloquium
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Lucio Piccirillo (University of Manchester)
Topic:        Next generation of CMB B-modes coherent instruments to reach r<0.01
Time:        1/11 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
I will present the status of our research at JBCA concerning the development of ultra low-noise
cryogenic LNAs and a novel interferometer scheme that can be used for CMB B-modes research. 

The majority of cryogenic HEMT amplifiers are usually cooled at physical temperatures of the order of 15 - 20K 
mostly because it is believed that the noise reduction with temperature is negligible with further reduction of the
temperature. We built a test cryostat equipped with our own design 1K fridge to characterise Ka-band amplifiers in the 
range 20K to 1K. We have extensively studied an MIC Planck EBB, a Faraday MMIC and a novel Transistor + MMIC amplifier 
all at Ka-band. 

We find that there is space for further improvement in noise performances when a comprehensive optimisation of bias
conditions with physical temperature is performed. In addition to a reduction in noise we observe also
a very interesting reduction in bias power dissipated by the amplifier. The results of our study allow us to
propose a potential scheme for the next generation of CMB B-modes experiments where a very large
number of pixels are needed. I will discuss the design of a ~1,000 horns W-band compact camera that can be
used to realise an interferometer installed in a single cryostat.
