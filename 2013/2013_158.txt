Arizona Radio Observatory: Call for Proposals (Fall 2013)
------------------------------------------------------------
Dear Astronomers in Taiwan,

Observing proposals from members of the University Consortium of ALMA-Taiwan
(UCAT) and ASIAA for the 10-meter Sub-Millimeter Telescope (SMT), located on
Mount Graham, of the Arizona Radio Observatory (ARO) are being solicited for the
period October 15, 2013 - January 31, 2014. The proposal deadline of UCAT/ASIAA
for this 2013 fall semester is set on September 17, 2013 (Tuesday).

The SMT currently supports a dual-polarization, 1 mm receiver (215-280 GHz) with
ALMA Band 6 sideband-separating (SBS) mixers, a dual-polarization 0.8 mm
(320-370 GHz) receiver, and a 0.4 mm (602-720 GHz) dual-polarization receiver
with ALMA Band 9 mixers. A new 0.7 mm (420-500 GHz) dual-polarization receiver
incorporating sideband-separating mixers will be available as well. The SMT
control system supports both dual polarization ("2 IF mode"), and dual
polarization, dual sideband observations ("4 IF mode"), as well as OTF mapping.
Remote observing is available http://aro.as.arizona.edu/remote/remote.htm .
Graduate student participation is especially encouraged.

Proposals should consist of:
1. A proposal Cover Sheet, obtainable at http://aro.as.arizona.edu/proposals .
2. A brief scientific and technical justification (no more than 2 pages).
3. A source list with observing time requirements and justification, and/or
    tables, figures and references (no more than 1 page in total).
4. Observers that plan to observe remotely must supply fixed IP address(es) of
    the computer(s) that will be used during observing on the cover sheet of
    the proposal.

Proposers are required to list on the cover sheet their requested observing
blocks (LST ranges), dates which they are not available to observe, and dates in
which sources in those observing blocks are within the Sun Avoidance Zone (the
SMT will not be pointed to sources within 44 degrees from the Sun).

Proposers should consult the ARO website http://aro.as.arizona.edu/ for
technical specifications. For further information about remote observing and
other operational questions, contact Tom Folkers, Operations Manager
tfolkers@email.arizona.edu .

Electronic submissions will be accepted in PDF format only. Scheduling of
successful proposals will be done according to availability of the receivers
requested. The final proposal pdf file should be emailed to
kuan@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw by  midnight (23:59 pm CST) September 17, 2013.


Kind regards,
Yi-Jehng Kuan
on behalf of UCAT's ARO TAC

Dear Prof Kuan,


Could you help to forward the following message to TAN?


Cheers,

> Subject: CFHT 2014A call for proposal, and "long-term" proposals

Dear All,

I would like to bring to your attention that the deadline for CFHT 2014A proposals 
is approaching, and it is Sep 19th 07:59.

One thing I need to point out is that there will be a new "long-term" proposal category 
for CFHT-Taiwan.  People who would like to request multi-semester observations or 
large amount of observing time, will need to follow the long-term proposal guideline.
The guideline, along with the call for proposals, can be found:
http://oir.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/cfht/observations.php

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions on this.

Cheers,
Wei-Hao Wang
on behalf of the CFHT-Taiwan TAC

Dear Colleagues,

You are cordially invited to attend the Joint Colloquium which will be held
on September 17.

The Joint Colloquium Series is organized by the NTU Physics Department,
Center for Condensed Matter Science (CCMS), Leung Center for Cosmology and
Particle Astrophysics (LeCosPA), Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and
Astrophysics (ASIAA), and the Institute of Atomic and Molecular Sciences
(IAMS).

The idea is to have excellent speakers to give inspiring, informative, but
non-technical talks on the frontiers of Sciences.

Enclosed below is the information of the Joint Colloquium on September 17.

Best regards,

Juinn-Wei Chen (NTU-Phys)
Jiwoo Nam (LeCosPA)
Michitoshi Hayashi (CCMS)
Lain-Jong Li (IAMS)
Yen-Ting Lin (ASIAA)

ASIAA/CCMS/IAMS/LeCosPA/NTU-Physics Joint Colloquium

Speaker: Professor Koji Hashimoto (=BE=F4=A5=BB=A9=AF=A4h =B1=D0=B1=C2)

        (Department of Physics, Osaka University)

Topic : Condensed Matter Physics from String Theory

Time  : 09/17 (Tue.) 14:20 - 15:10

Place : Room 104, CCMS-New Physics Building

Abstract:
    Superstring theory has been served as a candidate for a theory unifying
all matter and forces in the universe. Along its theoretical development, a
new "principle" was found: "holographic principle", in other words,
"AdS/CFT correspondence". This new principle creates bridges between
various subjects in physics: gravity, particle physics, condensed matter
and unclear physics. In this talk, I explain the new principle in plain
words, and tell you how it works, how it can be applied, and how it can put
an access to grand challenges in physics.

Title: Entanglement Entropy for Probe Branes, the leading Backreaction.

Abstract:
Motivated by the vast utility of probe brane systems, we will review
the notion of holographic quantum entanglement entropy, together with
the extension thereof by probe brane systems through systematically
taking the leading order backreaction of the probe branes into
account.
