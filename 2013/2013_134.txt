Dear Colleagues,

We would like to invite you to participate in the upcoming Summer School of
Astrobiology, on August  5-9, 2013.

This summer school aims to promote the interactions and training of young
generations in Taiwan for topics at the frontier of research. The broad
context under the theme of Astrobiology will bring an refreshing experience
for active researchers and students alike in related fields (star
formation, planetary sciences and biology), as well as beginning graduate
students entering the new, interdisciplinary field.
