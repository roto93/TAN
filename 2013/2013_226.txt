*** Special Seminar
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Aravind Natarajan (University of Pittsburg)
Topic:        Searching for Dark Matter through Radio Observations: Present and Future
Time:        12/16 (Monday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
It is now commonly accepted that most of the matter in the Universe is dark, but its identity is unknown. Weakly Interacting Massive Particles are well motivated candidates for dark matter. I will review the status of dark matter detection using direct, and collider searches. I then discuss two promising techniques for dark matter detection using radio observations: (i) Searching for excess synchrotron radiation from dwarf galaxies in the local group, and (ii) Observations of the highly redshifted 21cm line of neutral Hydrogen.  I discuss recent results from the SCI-HI global 21cm experiment and future prospects.
