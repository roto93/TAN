Dear Colleagues,

You are cordially invited to attend the Joint Colloquium which will be held
on December 24 (http://web.phys.ntu.edu.tw/colloquium/).

The Joint Colloquium Series is organized by the NTU Physics Department,
Center for Condensed Matter Science (CCMS), Leung Center for Cosmology and
Particle Astrophysics (LeCosPA), Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and
Astrophysics (ASIAA), and the Institute of Atomic and Molecular Sciences
(IAMS).

The idea is to have excellent speakers to give inspiring, informative, but
non-technical talks on the frontiers of Sciences.

Enclosed below is the information of the Joint Colloquium on December 24.

Best regards,

Yen-Ting Lin (ASIAA)
Michitoshi Hayashi (CCMS)
Chia-Lung Hsieh (IAMS)
Jiwoo Nam (LeCosPA)
Juinn-Wei Chen (NTU-Phys)

ASIAA/CCMS/IAMS/LeCosPA/NTU-Physics Joint Colloquium

Speaker: Kerson Huang

              (Massachusetts Institute of Technology)

Topic :  *Higgs and the Cosmos*

Time  : 12/24 (Tue.) 14:20 - 15:20

Place : Room 104, CCMS-New Physics Building

Abstract:
    The vacuum is filled with complex scalar fields, such as the Higgs
field. These fields serve as order parameters for superfluidity (quantum
phase coherence over macroscopic distances), making the entire universe a
superfluid. We review a model that attributes dark energy to the energy
density of the cosmic superfluid, and dark matter to local fluctuations of
the superfluid density.

Brief Bio:
    Kerson Huang is Professor of Physics, Emeritus, at MIT. His research
area included particle theory, statistical physics, biophysics, and most
recently, cosmology. He is the author of several physics textbooks,
including Quantum Field Theory, and Statistical Mechanics. He has
translated "The Rubaiyat" from English to classical Chinese quatrains, and
the Chinese classic "I Ching" into English. He has published two volumes of
poetry.
