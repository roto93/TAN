            Astronomy Colloquium
############################################

    2:20 p.m. 15th March 2013 (Friday)
      NTHU Physics Building, Rm620

    Speaker: Dr. Shinsuke Abe
              (National Central University)

    Title:  Earth Impactors
            - Meteorites and Their Parent Bodies -

    Abstract:
    Parent bodies of the most of major meteor showers have been
    identified as comets or dormant comets. On the other, it is still
    a matter of finding parent bodies of meteorites. Here, I will
    present asteroid related fireballs, for example, 'Chelyabinsk
    meteorite' which entered Earth's atmosphere over Russia at 03:20
    UT (09:20 LST) on 15 Fevruary 2013. Hayabusa-2 is an asteroid
    sample return mission of JAXA/ISAS (Japan Aerospace eXploration
    Agency/Institute of Space and Astronautical Sciences) which will
    be launched at the end of 2014, will explore a near-Earth asteroid
    (162173) 1999 JU3 in 2018, and will back to the Earth in 2020. The
    asteroid 1999 JU3 is also thought to be a parent body of
    carbonaceous chondrites.

    Tea/Discussion Time is followed in the same room.

                    All Welcome !!

Abstract: http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/activity/colloquium.php

*** Colloquium
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Tracy Beck (STScI)
Topic:        Star and Planet Formation Science with the James Webb Space Telescope
Time:        3/15 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is the next great observatory currently in development by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA).  The JWST will peer into deep space using it's 6.5 meter segmented primary mirror and it is infrared optimized to operate at 1 - 25 micron wavelengths.  The four main science themes for JWST are:  First Light and Reionization, the Assembly of Galaxies, the Birth of Stars and Planetary Systems, and Planetary Systems and the Origins of Life.  In this talk, I will introduce you to the JWST and discuss some of its key instrument modes that will have a very strong impact on my own field of research - the birth and early evolution of stars and their planetary systems.  I will also highlight some star and planet formation research projects that I have done using 8 meter-class telescopes in that will help to pave the way for future observations with JWST.

[Taiwan Proposal Announcement]

# FYI, original announcement from CFHT HQ is attached at the bottom of this mail.

############################################
Proposals for CFHT Open for Semester 2013B
############################################

The 3.6 meter optical/infrared Canadian-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) is
now open for proposals from all Taiwan-based researchers for semester 2013B.
The deadline for proposal submission is:

2013 March 25 23:59 UT, which is 2013 March 26, 7:59 Taiwan time

We anticipate that a minimum of 5 nights, and possibly up to 8 nights, will be available in semester 2013B,
depending on demand and quality of proposals. Please note that the instruments
available for 2013B are MegaCam,
WIRCam, ESPaDOnS, and PUEO with KIR.

Detailed information on the telescope, available instrumentation, proposal
format, and how to submit proposals is available from the CFHT web page:

http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/en/science/Proposals/

Note on WIRCAM:
For WIRCam, pay careful attention to the added note about narrow band
filters and their availability.

http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/en/science/QSO/ph1_WC.html


### Important Reminder ###

(1) If you have any problems with proposal submission and/or time
allocation for CFHT Taiwan Time, please contact the Taiwan TAC
(ohyama-at-asiaa.sinica.edu.tw) instead of contacting CFHT directly.

(2) Please fill in or update the status of all your previous projects on
the web page

https://oir.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/cfht/project [Authentication required]

You can and should provide more details on the progress of previous
(especially related) projects in the relevant section of your proposal. IF NO
INFORMATION IS FORTHCOMING, THE TAC WILL ASSUME THAT NO PROGRESS
HAS BEEN MADE AND WILL TAKE THIS INTO CONSIDERATION IN ALLOCATION
OF OBSERVING TIME.


### Exploratory Programs ###

To encourage innovative science, this semester we will continue considering
"exploratory" programs using MegaCam, WIRCam, or ESPaDOnS that require
no more than 1 hour of observing time. Such proposals will not be refereed, but
will be scrutinized by the TAC and allocated time based on scientific merit and
feasibility. When submitting such proposals, please state at the beginning of the
scientific justification that "This is an EXPLORATORY proposal".


### Queued Service Observations Snapshot Programs ###

In addition, we would like to bring to your attention the Queued Service Observation
(QSO) snapshot program. These are programs that can be executed with either
MegaCam or WIRCam in relatively poor seeing conditions when the seeing is <1.2".
Projects executed under the QSO snapshot program are not charged to the
available observing time for Taiwan. Proposals to the QSO snapshot program will not
be refereed, but will be scrutinized by the TAC for scientific value and feasibility.


### Resubmission due to Lost Time ###

If your scheduled project from previous semesters was not completed for
any reason (including bad weather), you will need to resubmit your proposal
explaining why you need more time. Your proposal will be stronger if the available data has
been analyzed, and you use this data to demonstrate that the stated science goals can be
achieved with allocation of the full requested time.


### Notes on Large Programs (LPs) ###

New large programs (LPs) will be launched from 2013A. Some of you may want to check possible duplication of your science targets with those programs.

For more information, please follow the links below:
http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/en/science/LargePrograms/index.php
http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/en/science/LP_13_16/index.php

For those who are participating those programs as one of co-Is, please note on the proposal that the program you are proposing is related to those LPs or not. When you propose new observing program(s) aside of your LP participation, please make sure and state somewhere in the proposal that you (and your co-Is) can execute both programs.


### Time Allocation Process ###

All new proposals, and where deemed necessary resubmitted proposals, are
refereed by researchers selected by the Taiwan-CFHT TAC based on their demonstrated
expertise in the relevant research fields.
Apart from the referees comments, who are asked to evaluate primarily the
scientific strength of the proposal, the Taiwan-CFHT TAC also takes into account
technical feasibility. For those who have previously been scheduled observing time
on the CFHT, the Taiwan-CFHT TAC will also take into account the status of previously
executed projects and publications.


### Status of Previous Proposals ###

Please fill in or update the status of all your previous projects on the web page
https://oir.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/cfht/ [Authentication required]

You can and should provide more details on the progress of previous
(especially related) projects in the relevant section of your proposal. If no information is
forthcoming, the TAC will assume that no progress has been made and will take this into
consideration in allocation of observing time.
