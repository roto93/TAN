Topic:        Approaching the Speed Limit: Discovering A Powerful Jet Acceleration

Place:        R1203
Abstract:
In 1966 M. Rees predicted that "an object moving relativistically in suitable directions may appear to a distant observer to have a transverse velocity much greater than the speed of light". Just a few years later in 1969, our curiosity became evident; J. Gubbay and others obtained a first indication of "superluminal motions" in quasars by VLBI observations. They are now widely recognized as highly relativistic outflows, initiated around the black holes/neutron stars, exhibit apparent velocities faster than light, when they align within a small viewing angle along the line of sight. "How can the flow obtain such an extremely fast speed?" is one of big unanswered questions that high-energy astrophysicists have been facing for over 40 years. We finally solve this puzzle with EVN observations towards M87 with the confirmation that an asymptotic acceleration of streaming take places from 1% to 99% of the speed of light. We conclude that the six billion solar mass black hole produ
ces a magnetic jet exhaust nozzle, extending up to the host galaxy scale over 10^5 Schwarzschild radius. Our result constitutes a solid foundation of the magnetohydrodynamic paradigm for astrophysical jets.
