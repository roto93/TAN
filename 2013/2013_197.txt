ADDITIONAL INFO!!

(1) Cycle 1 Duplication Checklist (added on Nov 6)
http://almascience.nao.ac.jp/proposing/call-for-proposals/duplications

Cycle 2 proposals will be checked for duplication against successful =
Cycle 1=20
(though not Cycle 0) projects. The duplication criteria are given in
Section 7.2.2 of the Proposer's Guide:
<http://almascience.org/proposing/call-for-proposals/proposers-guide#PG
Sect7.2.2>.

Cycle 2 PIs should avoid proposing the same targets with similar =
observational=20
parameters in their Cycle 2 proposals, or should explain clearly why the
proposed observations would not constitute a duplication.

(2) Observations of monitoring or predictable events with ACA.
The ACA restriction listed in Section 9 of the=20
"ALMA Capabilities page"
http://almascience.nao.ac.jp/proposing/call-for-proposals/capabilities
does not apply to observations of phenomena with predictable times and =
for
monitoring projects...
Please check Knowledgebase article titled
"If I observe a predictable phenomenon, is my project considered time =
constrained?"
on the science portal
