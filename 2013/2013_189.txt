Dear Prospective ALMA users,

Call for Proposals for ALMA Cycle 2

The ALMA Director, on behalf of the Joint ALMA Observatory (JAO) and the=20=

partner organizations in East Asia, Europe, and North America, is
pleased to announce the Early Science Cycle 2 Call for Proposals (CfP).
Members of the astronomical community are invited to propose for
scientific observations that will be scheduled from June 2014 to October
2015.

At full operational capability, the ALMA Observatory will include an =
array of fifty=20
12-m antennas for long baseline interferometric observations (the 12-m
Array), and the Atacama Compact Array (ACA, aka Morita Array) composed
of twelve 7-m antennas for short baseline interferometric observations
(7-m Array) and four 12-m antennas for single-dish observations (Total
Power or TP Array).

Cycle 2 observations provide an exciting opportunity for science from =
this unique=20
world-class facility, though completion of the full 66-antenna array
remains the highest ALMA priority.

Dear colleagues,

    As the ALMA Cycle 2 call for proposal has just been announced, =
ALMA Taiwan ARC node will make  efforts in helping users submit their =
best proposals. In doing so, the following steps will be taken: (1) Call =
for ALMA Taiwan Notice of Intent, (2) ALMA-T User Workshop, (3) Proposal =
Writing Camp, and (4) Mock Proposal Review.=20

    1) *** Call for ALMA Taiwan Notice of Intent (NoI) ***

    Prospective users are STRONGLY advised to submit a Notice of =
Intent to Taiwan ARC about your proposal plan. We appreciate those =
colleagues who have already copied to us their earlier NoI submissions =
to JAO. For colleagues who plan to submit ALMA proposals but have not =
notified Taiwan ARC, please send in your proposal information as the =
following to "arc@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw" by November 1st (Friday).

    ALMA-T Notice of Intent:
    PI : (e.g. Carl)
    Proposal title : (e.g. The Search of ET)
    Brief proposal objective and plan : (e.g. Target Vega at H2O =
maser bands)
    Submission Path : (e.g. North America)

    2) *** ALMA-T User Workshop ***

    The Taiwan ARC node will organize jointly with UCAT an user =
workshop to be held on Nov 8th (Friday), in which updates about the ALMA =
project status, cycle 2 capabilities and CASA software will be provided. =
Further details and registration information will be announced =
separately very soon.

    3) *** Proposal Writing Camp ***

    The Taiwan ARC node will host an ALMA Proposal Writing Camp at =
ASIAA. The purpose is to help users sharpen and polish the proposals =
well before the deadline for the mock review (see item 3) as well as the =
final submission. The camp will be held on Nov 14, 15, and 18 from 9am =
to 5pm on each day in room 1107. One to two ARC members will be one-site =
for providing technical advices, and an English editor will be around =
for grammatical suggestions.

    4) Mock Proposal Review :

    As in previous cycles, a mock proposal review for Taiwan users =
will be held to encourage prospective users get the proposals prepared =
early.  All Taiwanese users are welcome to submit their proposals. Full =
proposal, including scientific and technical justification, figures and =
tables, is required for the review; technical and scientific comments =
will feedback to the PIs afterwards so that PIs can incorporate the =
comments into proposal revision before their final submission.
    The proposal submission deadline for the mock review will be on =
Nov 19th, and feedbacks to the PIs will be provided on Nov 26th.

    5) Important Dates=20

    Nov  1 : Deadline for ALMA Taiwan Notice of Intent
    Nov  8 : ALMA-T User Workshop
    Nov 14 : Proposal Writing Camp
    Nov 15 : Proposal Writing Camp
    Nov 18 : Proposal Writing Camp
    Nov 19 : Mock Proposal Review Submission Deadline
    Nov 26 : Mock Proposal Review Feedbacks to PIs
    Dec  5 : ALMA Cycle 2 Proposal Submission Deadline

    Again, the steps are to encourage users to get the proposals =
prepared as early as possible. Please note down the related dates and =
participate the events. Contact ARC members at arc@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw =
if you have any question.

Best,
Chin-Fei
