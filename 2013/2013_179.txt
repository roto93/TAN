Topic:        Stellar Density Waves in M81
Time:        10/15 (Tuesday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1108
Abstract:
Aside from the grand-design stellar spirals appeared in the disk of M81, another pair of stellar spiral situated well inside the bright bulge of M81 are recently discovered by Kendall et al. (2008). The seemly unrelated two pairs of spirals pose a challenge to the theory of spiral density wave. In this work, a three-component model associated with a stellar disk, a bulge and a dark halo is first constructed as the basic state of M81 with the maximum contact with the observational constraints. We then apply the modal approach to the constructed model of M81 to look for discrete unstable spiral modes. We conclude that the seemly separated inner and outer spirals can be well explained by the presence of a single trailing spiral mode. They share the same pattern speed 25.5 km/s/kpc with the radius of corotation at 9.03 kpc. In addition to the good agreement in the spiral pattern, the variation of spiral amplitude can be also naturally reproduced within the framework of modal appr
oach.

Dear Colleagues,

You are cordially invited to attend the Joint Colloquium which will be held
on October 22.

The Joint Colloquium Series is organized by the NTU Physics Department,
Center for Condensed Matter Science (CCMS), Leung Center for Cosmology and
Particle Astrophysics (LeCosPA), Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and
Astrophysics (ASIAA), and the Institute of Atomic and Molecular Sciences
(IAMS).

The idea is to have excellent speakers to give inspiring, informative, but
non-technical talks on the frontiers of Sciences.

Enclosed below is the information of the Joint Colloquium on October 22.

Best regards,

Yen-Ting Lin (ASIAA)
Michitoshi Hayashi (CCMS)
Lain-Jong Li (IAMS)
Jiwoo Nam (LeCosPA)
Juinn-Wei Chen (NTU-Phys)

ASIAA/CCMS/IAMS/LeCosPA/NTU-Physics Joint Colloquium

Speaker: Prof George Wei-Shu Hou (=ABJ=BA=FB=AE=A4 =B1=D0=B1=C2)

            (Dept. of Physics, National Taiwain University)

Topic : a Higgstory --- Special Colloquium on the 2013 Nobel Prize in
Physics

Time  : 10/22 (Tue.) 14:20 - 15:10

Place : Room 104, CCMS-New Physics Building

Abstract:
  History has it that a Higgs boson was discovered through the gluon-gluon
fusion process in high energy p-p collisions that, by all counts so far,
confirms theoretical prediction. With the 2013 Physics Nobel Prize awarded
to Englert and Higgs, we trace the backdrop in the early 1960s, how the
separate groups of antagonists were led to propose the now awarded
mechanism that allow gauge bosons to become massive through
spontaneous symmetry breaking, how the hunting started with the
emergence of the Standard Model, culminating in the discovery last year
by the gigantic experiments called ATLAS and CMS, operating at the CERN
LHC. Anecdotes would be splattered throughout.

        2:20 p.m. 25 Oct. 2013 (Friday)

        Title: Status of the TAOS Project


        Abstract:
TAOS II will comprise three 1.3-m telescopes (F/4) and each telescope
is equipped with a 9k x 9k mosaic CMOS camera with a field-of-view of
~1.2 square degrees. We attempt to monitor over 10,000 stars with the
cadence of 20 Hz or higher. The telescopes will be installed in San
Pedro Mr%@rtir Observatory, Ensenada, Mexico, and the site 
has a typical seeing of 0.6 arcsec and about 250 clear nights per 
year. Currently, the infrastructure of the site is under developing,
and two of the telescopes is ready for optics test in the shop. The
installation of telescopes will start in 2014. The CMOS devices is
designed and manufactured by e2v technologies. %@ We will receive the
detectors from 2015. We plan to start the science operation in the
spring of 2016.

    Tea/Discussion Time is followed in the same room.

                  All Welcome !!
