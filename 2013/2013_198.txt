      Title: Super-Luminous Supernovae:
            Giant Supernovae in Dwarf Hosts

      Abstract:
In this talk, I will introduce the supernova studies at QUB, our basic
understanding of super-luminous supernovae and their host galaxies
from several precious events, such as SN2010gx and PTF-12dam. We
have found the host of SN2010gx to have a remarkably low
metallicity (equal to 0.06 solar metallicity) as determined from
the detection of the [OIII] f4363 line.

We keep collecting more host galaxy samples, if the low
metallicity is a common factor among them, it will be a major
constraint on the progenitor channel of super-luminous supernovae,
and also helps to explain the low intrinsic rates (~10^-4 of the
core-collapse population) of the super-luminous supernovae detected
so far.

    Tea/Discussion Time is followed in the same room.

                  All Welcome !!
