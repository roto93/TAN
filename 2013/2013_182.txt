*** Special Seminar
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Kent D. Irwin (Department of Physics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA)
Topic:        X-Ray Emission and Near-Edge Absorption Spectroscopy Using Superconducting Transition-Edge Sensors
Time:        10/22 (Tuesday) 11:00 - 12:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
This paper describes the development of superconducting transition-edge sensors (TES) for x-ray emission and near-edge absorption spectroscopy at light sources. Conventional x-ray spectrometers typically have either poor spectral resolution or low efficiency. The TES uses a superconducting film biased in the superconducting transition as a sensing element. TES x-ray detectors have energy resolution up to two orders of magnitude higher than semiconductor detectors, with much higher efficiency than dispersive systems. This combination makes it possible to efficiently study spectral features due to chemical shifts in both emission and absorption features. The implementation of new superconducting integrated circuit multiplexers is now enabling the development of large arrays of TES x-ray detectors, which will provide revolutionary new capabilities to synchrotron and free-electron-laser light sources.

Dear Asada and all

  I just got the message that Dr. Kent Irwin would like to change the topic
of his talk which is more related to astronomy. Following is update
information.

Title: Cosmology with superconducting detectors

Kent Irwin, Department of Physics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305

Abstract:
Superconducting microwave detectors and polarimeters are now widely used to
constrain cosmological parameters and to search for physics beyond the
standard model, including inflation and neutrino mass. Measurements of the
polarziation of the CMB are used to search for the signal of primordial
gravitational waves, and to probe structure evolution through lensing of
the CMB. Galaxy clusters are studied through the inverse Compton scattering
of CMB photons off of the hot plasma in the intra-cluster medium. I will
describe our work developing instruments for cosmological measurements with
the CMB, including the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, the South Pole
Telescope, and the MUSTANG instrument on the Green Bank Telescope.

Sorry for late notice and welcome you all to attend Dr. Kent Irwin's talk.

Asada-san: can you help to update this information on the website? Thanks.

Best Regards,

Ming-Jye
