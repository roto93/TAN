> OBJECTIVES:
> This series of Cosmic Dust meetings aims at finding a consensus among
experts on the formation and evolution of cosmic dust: where it comes from
and where it goes. The meeting is organized by dust freaks who are very
enthusiastic not only to make the goal achievable but also to establish a
dust community across every scientifically relevant discipline for the
development of cosmic dust research. For this reason, the primary
objectives of the meeting are to bring together professionals who deal with
cosmic dust and to provide an opportunity for participants to develop human
relations and interactions between the participants.

> SCOPE:
> All kinds of cosmic dust such as

> � interstellar dust
> � protoplanetary disk dust
> � debris disk dust
> � cometary dust
> � asteroidal dust
> � interplanetary dust
> � circumplanetary dust
> � stellar nebular condensates
> � presolar grains
> � micrometeorites
> � meteoroids

> � planetary aerosols
> are the subject of discussion. The meeting is open for any aspects of
dust research by means of different methods of studies (in-situ and
laboratory measurements, astronomical observations, laboratory and
numerical analogue simulations, theoretical modeling, data analyses, etc.).
All dust-related topics, for example, the formation of molecules and their
reactions on and their desorption from the surface of dust particles, are
also welcome. Publishing the proceedings of this meeting is currently being
planned as a special issue of a peer-reviewed journal, while paper
submission to the proceedings is not obligatory.

> BRIEF HISTORY:
> The Cosmic Dust meeting started in 2006 as a session called 鏠osmic Dust�
of the 3rd AOGS (Asia-Oceania Geoscience Society) annual meeting in
Singapore. Dust freaks have kept on organizing the session at subsequent
AOGS meetings in Korea (2008), India (2010), and Taiwan (2011). The Cosmic
Dust series has been recognized as the most successful session of the AOGS
Planetary Sciences Section. In 2012, the time was ripe to be free from
organizing restrictions on the AOGS meeting. From that time on, the Cosmic
Dust meeting is totally independent of any international conference. The
past meetings on Cosmic Dust have been held in a relaxed and joyful
atmosphere. So will be the coming one!
