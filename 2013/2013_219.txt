*** Colloquium
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Ralph Pudritz (Origins Institute, and Dept. of Physics and Astronomy, McMaster University.)
Topic:        The early evolution of disks, jets, and protostellar spins
Time:        12/4 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
The formation of disks and outflows as a consequence of 
the collapse of dense, magnetized, molecular cloud cores is a central
problem in star formation.  Collapse in a magnetized medium holds a major
surprise in that magnetic braking by an ordered field can strongly 
surpress disk formation.  A related question is why the 
spin rates of many young stars are so low despite their
high accretion rates.  How is the angular momentum problem of young
stars resolved?  This talk traces the early evolution of collapsing magnetized
cores through the formation of disks, outflows, and accretion-powered
stellar winds means by which the angular momentum problem of star formation 
is resolved.
