The 2013 Scientific Assembly of the Astronomical Society of the Republic of
China (ASROC2013) will be held at National Penghu University of Science and
Technology on May 24 (Friday) - 26 (Sunday), 2013. This is the annual event
for
all astronomers and astrophysicists in Taiwan to demonstrate their most recent
discoveries and observations, to report their latest research results and to
exchange ideas, also to organize cooperation when desirable. Oral
presentations
and conference posters in all areas of astronomy and astrophysics are
solicited.
ASROC2013 is an excellent venue, too, for students, in particular graduate
students, to present their research findings or progress from their thesis
studies.

    The meeting will include plenary talks, scientific and educational
sessions, poster presentation, and a business meeting. The featured plenary
speakers are 1) Prof. Andrew Fabian of University of Cambridge, a Fellow of
the
Royal Society and also the President of the Royal Astronomical Society
(2008-2010), the award recipient of the Rossi Prize (2001) of American
Astronomical Society (AAS), the Dannie Heineman Prize (2008) of the AAS and
American Institute of Physics (AIP) and the Gold Medal (2012) of the Royal
Astronomical Society, and 2) Dr. Donald Goldsmith of Interstellar Media, also
the winner of the Science Writing Award (1986) of AIP, the Dorothea Klumpke-
Roberts Award (1990) of Astronomical Society of the Pacific (ASP) in
popularization of astronomy, the Annenberg Award (1995) of AAS in astronomy
education, and the Award for best science book of the year (2004) from
Amazon.com. The titles of plenary talks are Accreting Black Holes (tentative)
and The Search for Life in the Universe, respectively.

    ASROC2013 website will be ready by mid-January; on-line registration
