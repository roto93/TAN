*** Colloquium

Speaker:    Mar Mezcua (Instituto de Astrofç©©sica de Canarias (IAC))
Topic:        SUPERMASSIVE BINARY BLACK HOLE SYSTEMS
Time:        6/28 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
It is widely accepted that galaxies are not isolated objects in the Universe, but are rather observed to undergo galaxy merging. If nearly all galaxies host a supermassive black hole in their center, it is expected that pairs of supermassive black holes will be formed in the course of a merger event. The detection and number estimates of binary black hole systems can, thus, help us to understand how galaxies form and grow, and shed light on the evolutionary models that rule the Universe.

In this Colloquium I will present observational evidence for binary black hole systems in three kinds of extragalactic objects: X-shaped radio galaxies, ultraluminous X-ray sources, and double nucleus galaxies. I will detail our observations and analyses of these systems and the conclusions obtained when combined all observational data.
