Dear Prof. Kuan, 

I should appreciate it if you could advertise the following workshop 
on TAN.  Although I advertised the excursion deadline (Feb 7) 
to some institutes (e.g., ASIAA, NTHU), I forgot to send it to TAN. 

Thank you very much.

Japan.  Thus, the objective of this workshop is to outline 
a future coordinated program of collaborative work between 
Taiwan and Japan on the physics of compact objects. 
Everyone is cordially invited. 

Topics: 
  * Accretion onto compact objects, 
  * Structures of black-hole magnetospheres, 
  * General-relativistic effects around a black hole, 
  * Radio(VLBI)-imaging of the vicinity of a black hole, 
  * Formation, propagation, and acceleration of jets 
  * Other topics (e.g., black holes, pulsars, jets, ...)
