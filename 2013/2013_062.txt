==============================================================================

Dear all,

  This is the final call for ASROC2013 abstract submission.
  Please note that the abstract submission deadline of ASROC2013 is
  at 23:59 CST on March 31 (Sunday). 

  Please also note that the online registration deadline of ASROC2013
  is at 23:59 CST on April 15 (Monday).

  By the way, the booking of airline tickets for May 24-26 is now available.
  However, if you encounter a difficulty in obtaining a seat, one alternative
  besides taking a boat ride to depart for Penghu from airports other than
  Taipei, such as Tainan, Kaohsiung or Taichung.  Good luck.

  Astronomical Society of the Republic of China 2013 Scientific Assembly
                            (ASROC2013)

      National Penghu University of Science and Technology, Penghu
                            May 24 - 26, 2013

Second Circular
_______________

ASROC2013, the 2013 Scientific Assembly of the Astronomical Society of the
Republic of China, will be held at National Penghu University of Science and
Technology on May 24-26 (Fri-Sun). This is the annual event for all astronomers
and astrophysicists in Taiwan to report their latest results and to exchange
new ideas. ASROC2013 is an excellent venue, too, for graduate students to
present their research findings and/or progress from thesis studies.

    Besides scientific and educational sessions, poster presentations, and
a business meeting, ASROC2013 will also include two plenary talks:
"Probing Strong Gravity with Accreting Black Holes" (on May 25) given by the
former President of the Royal Astronomical Society and a Fellow of the Royal
Society, Prof. Andrew Fabian of University of Cambridge, and "The Search for
Life in the Universe" (on May 26) by Dr. Donald Goldsmith, the winner of the
Annenberg Award of American Astronomical Society in astronomy education, and
the Dorothea Klumpke-Roberts Award of Astronomical Society of the Pacific in
popularization of astronomy, respectively.

        In addition to the scientific agenda, a half-day free time is reserved
for group discussion or group excursions at choice in the afternoon of May 25
(Sat); a conference banquet will be held later in the evening and all meeting
participants are welcome to attend (please refer to
http://www.asroc.org.tw/asroc2013/en/tourbanquet.php for more details).
During the meeting, exhibitions of astronomical books and instruments, portable
telescopes are also planned.  Given the meeting date overlap the annual Penghu
Firework Festival, participants of ASROC2013 are strongly encouraged to make
travel arrangements and hotel booking as early as possible. (Please refer to
http://www.asroc.org.tw/asroc2013/en/travelNAccom.php#travel for more details.)

    ASROC2013 website has been online since January 16; participants of the
scientific assembly should submit their abstracts and register online. The
abstract submission deadline is March 31, and the on-line registration deadline
is April 15. A registration fee of NT$500 should be paid on site. For more
detailed information and update, please visit the ASROC website at

Dear Colleagues,

You are cordially invited to attend the Joint Colloquium which will be held on April 02.
The Joint Colloquium Series is organized by
the NTU Physics Department, Center for Condensed Matter Science (CCMS),
Leung Center for Cosmology and Particle Astrophysics (LeCosPA),
Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA),
and the Institute of Atomic and Molecular Sciences (IAMS).
The idea is to have excellent speakers to give inspiring, informative,
but non-technical talks on the frontiers of Sciences.

Enclosed below is the information of the Joint Colloquium on April 02.

Best regards,

Pisin Chen (LeCosPA)
Ting-Wai Chiu (NTU-Phys)
Michitoshi Hayashi (CCMS)
Lain-Jong Li (IAMS)
Michihiro Takami (ASIAA)

ASIAA/CCMS/IAMS/LeCosPA/NTU-Physics Joint Colloquium
Speaker: Professor  Toshio Matsumoto
        (Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Academia Sinica)
        (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency)
Topic : A search for the light of the first stars; The enigma of the near-infrared background
Time  : 04/02 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:10
Place : Room 104, CCMS-New Physics Building


Abstract :
    The first stars of the universe have attracted the strong interest of astronomers, as the first stars could re-ionized the universe and must be key objects to delineate the dark age of the universe. It has been thought that the first stars are very massive and luminous, however, it is difficult to detect individual stars even with JWST. To overcome the faintness of individual stars, we have tried to observe the near-infrared background to detect the integrated red-shifted light of the first stars. This is a challenging observation,  since there exist bright foreground and backgrounds, however the space probes, COBE, IRTS, AKARI and Spitzer succeeded in detecting excess sky brightness and fluctuation that can not be explained with known foreground emission  sources. In addition to these results, I will present the recent result of the sounding rocket experiment, CIBER, and its implications for the study of the first stars.


Brief Bio. :
    Dr. Matsumoto has been one of the pioneers for space infrared observations in Japan. After attaining a Ph.D. at Nagoya University, he worked for Nagoya University and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), being involved in a number of observations with rockets, and leading the 1st and 2nd Japanese infrared satellite missions, winning several awards in Japan.
    He is now a professor emeritus at JAXA, and significantly involved in the next Japanese and European infrared mission (SPICA) and a international rocket mission with USA, Japan and Korea (CIBER). Since he retired from the professorship at JAXA in 2005, he has been assisting Korea and Taiwan in the SPICA collaboration.
