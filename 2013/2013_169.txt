********************** Final Announcement *******************************

    The Life Cycle of Dust in the Universe:
    Observations, Theory, and Laboratory Experiments

    November 18-22, 2013, Taipei, Taiwan

    http://events.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/meeting/20131118/

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT UPCOMING DEADLINE:

The deadline for registration is on 25 October. Please submit your
registration form and complete your payment before the deadline.

The deadline to submit abstracts for contributed talks has already
passed.  At this time we only accept abstracts for poster
presentations, also until 25 October.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

OBJECTIVES:

This meeting aims to address the life cycle of dust in the Universe,
which covers the formation, evolution and destruction of dust in a
range of environments, ranging from the smallest to the largest
scales. Bringing together observational and theoretical
astrophysicists as well as meteoriticists and experimentalists will
allow for a cross-disciplinary dialogue.

The meeting follows a successful tradition of astrophysical dust
meetings, starting in Albany in 1972, with the latest edition "Cosmic
Dust: Near and Far" organized by Th. Henning taking place in
Heidelberg in 2008.

Since that meeting, the field of dust astrophysics has made major
leaps forward with the hoist of data arriving from such missions as
the infrared space telescopes Spitzer, Herschel, and Stardust, the
latter returning dust samples from comet Wild-2 currently being
studied in the lab. The largest telescope on Earth, ALMA, has recently
come online, allowing for investigations into the origin of dust in
the Universe. Thus, this is an excellent time to review the status of
the field of dust astrophysics in this meeting.

The meeting aims to create an environment in which all aspects of the
life cycle of dust will be discussed, from an astrophysical, chemical
and mineralogical perspective, and the effect on a range of
environments. Observational insights, theoretical models and
experimental approaches all contribute to our view of the life cycle
of dust, and the meeting will address new developments and future
projects in all these areas.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

CONFERENCE PROGRAM:

The conference talk schedule is now available on-line. The preliminary
list of poster presentations is also available, but we still accept

coast of Yeliu with its beautiful rock formations, followed by a visit
to the night market of Keelung.

On the weekend after the conference (23 & 24 November), a two-day trip
to Taroko Gorge will be offered. This scenic canyon on Taiwan's east
coast is definitely worth a visit!

2-day workshop at Academia Sinica on 25 and 26 November 2013 in honor
of Typhoon Lee's 65th birthday, celebrating his contributions to the
field of meteoritics and dust astrophysics. This will also be the
inauguration meeting for Academia Sinica's NanoSIMS facility.

can be found on http://events.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/workshop/20131125/

Dear Colleagues,

You are cordially invited to attend the Joint Colloquium which will be held
on October 8.

The Joint Colloquium Series is organized by the NTU Physics Department,
Center for Condensed Matter Science (CCMS), Leung Center for Cosmology and
Particle Astrophysics (LeCosPA), Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and
Astrophysics (ASIAA), and the Institute of Atomic and Molecular Sciences
(IAMS).

The idea is to have excellent speakers to give inspiring, informative, but
non-technical talks on the frontiers of Sciences.

Enclosed below is the information of the Joint Colloquium on October 8.

Best regards,

Yen-Ting Lin (ASIAA)
Michitoshi Hayashi (CCMS)
Lain-Jong Li (IAMS)
Jiwoo Nam (LeCosPA)
Juinn-Wei Chen (NTU-Phys)

ASIAA/CCMS/IAMS/LeCosPA/NTU-Physics Joint Colloquium

Speaker: Prof Gil Holder

        (Dept. of Physics, McGill University)

Topic : The Cosmic Microwave Background in High Definition

Time  : 10/08 (Tue.) 14:20 - 15:10

Place : Room 104, CCMS-New Physics Building

Abstract:
    High resolution studies of the cosmic microwave background provide new
views on neutrinos, dark energy, and cosmological structure formation. This
new information comes through an improved understanding of the primary
fluctuations imprinted in the early universe, as well as through
measurements of the effects of Compton scattering and gravitational lensing
by structure in the late universe. I'll report  results from the South Pole
Telescope, including a recent detection of the characteristic "B-mode"
pattern of polarized fluctuations that is caused by gravitational lensing.

Brief Bio:
    Dr Holder is the Canada Research Chair in Cosmological Astrophysics at
McGill University and a senior fellow in the Cosmology and Gravity program
of the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research. He obtained his PhD from
the University of Chicago and did postdoctoral research at the Institute
for Advanced Study. His research is at the interface of theory and
experiment in measuring large scale structure in the universe, developing
new techniques for cosmology.

------------------------------


The formation and evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are
among the most exciting and challenging topics in astronomy and
astrophysics. New wide-field deep surveys are required to tackle
these issues, and Subaru's new wide-field camera (Hyper Suprime-Cam;
HSC) will bring promising opportunities to make breakthroughs in
this research field. Since the HSC-SSP (Subaru Strategic Program)
survey will start soon (in Spring 2014), it is a good time to have
an intensive face-to-face discussion among HSC collaboration
astronomers about scientific opportunities from the first-year data.

We will focus on doing science and writing papers based on the
first-year data of the coming HSC-SSP survey. These discussions in
advance of the start of the HSC-SSP survey will maximize the
scientific output in the theme of SMBH studies.

We will focus on the following topics, among others:
  -- Current status of the HSC operation plans, camera, and pipeline
  -- Commissioning run results and the data
  -- Survey plans and output photometric catalogs
  -- Quasar selection methods
  -- AGN photometric redshifts
  -- Statistics of quasars and SMBHs from the HSC data
  -- Co-evolution studies of SMBHs and galaxies with the HSC data
  -- Synergies of HSC and multi-wavelength data for SMBH studies
  -- Strategies for spectroscopic follow-up and the relation with PFS
  -- Theoretical preparations for HSC quasar surveys
  -- Action items for the HSC-SSP survey

The meeting will take place at Academia Sinica, Institute of Astronomy
and Astrophysics (ASIAA). The institute is located in the city of
Taipei, the capital of Taiwan, on the grounds of National Taiwan
University (*not* in the Academia Sinica Campus near Nan-Kang). The
weather in Taipei is typically fine and warm in January, and visitors
can enjoy nearby night markets (the nearest one is within walking
distance), historical places within the city, excellent museums, one
of the tallest skyscrapers in the world, and superb cuisine, all
accessible with a very convenient subway system.

Details of registration, abstract submission, travel info, and so on
will be announced in the second circular, which will be distributed
at the end of October. Though the total available budget is limited,
we will be able to support travel expenses for some of the
participants. More details on this travel support will be announced
in the second circular. If you have any questions, please feel free
to contact us (see below).

We plan to arrange your hotel reservations after gathering information
about your stay, which will be announced in the 2nd circular. We can
also help with visas, and therefore please let the LOC know as soon as
possible if you need it.

We are looking forward to seeing you in Taipei!
