Dear Colleagues,

You are cordially invited to attend the Joint Colloquium which will be held
on September 17.

The Joint Colloquium Series is organized by the NTU Physics Department,
Center for Condensed Matter Science (CCMS), Leung Center for Cosmology and
Particle Astrophysics (LeCosPA), Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and
Astrophysics (ASIAA), and the Institute of Atomic and Molecular Sciences
(IAMS).

The idea is to have excellent speakers to give inspiring, informative, but
non-technical talks on the frontiers of Sciences.

Enclosed below is the information of the Joint Colloquium on September 17.

Best regards,

Juinn-Wei Chen (NTU-Phys)
Jiwoo Nam (LeCosPA)
Michitoshi Hayashi (CCMS)
Lain-Jong Li (IAMS)
Yen-Ting Lin (ASIAA)

ASIAA/CCMS/IAMS/LeCosPA/NTU-Physics Joint Colloquium

Speaker: Professor Koji Hashimoto (=BE=F4=A5=BB=A9=AF=A4h =B1=D0=B1=C2)

        (Department of Physics, Osaka University)

Topic : Condensed Matter Physics from String Theory

Time  : 09/17 (Tue.) 14:20 - 15:10

Place : Room 104, CCMS-New Physics Building

Abstract:
    Superstring theory has been served as a candidate for a theory unifying
all matter and forces in the universe. Along its theoretical development, a
new "principle" was found: "holographic principle", in other words,
"AdS/CFT correspondence". This new principle creates bridges between
various subjects in physics: gravity, particle physics, condensed matter
and unclear physics. In this talk, I explain the new principle in plain
words, and tell you how it works, how it can be applied, and how it can put
an access to grand challenges in physics.
