*** Colloquium
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Tracy Beck (STScI)
Topic:        Star and Planet Formation Science with the James Webb Space Telescope
Time:        3/15 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is the next great observatory currently in development by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA).  The JWST will peer into deep space using it's 6.5 meter segmented primary mirror and it is infrared optimized to operate at 1 - 25 micron wavelengths.  The four main science themes for JWST are:  First Light and Reionization, the Assembly of Galaxies, the Birth of Stars and Planetary Systems, and Planetary Systems and the Origins of Life.  In this talk, I will introduce you to the JWST and discuss some of its key instrument modes that will have a very strong impact on my own field of research - the birth and early evolution of stars and their planetary systems.  I will also highlight some star and planet formation research projects that I have done using 8 meter-class telescopes in that will help to pave the way for future observations with JWST.
