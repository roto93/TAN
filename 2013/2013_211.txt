Title: Planet formation in inhomogeneous protoplanetary disks

Abstract:
One of the most fundamental questions in theories of planet formation
is how planets form out of protoplanetary disks. As shown by many
previous studies, planetary migration, that arises from resonant,
tidal interactions between protoplanets and the natal disks,
jeopardizes the existence of any planetary system around the central
stars. In this talk, I will present all the key results of my recent
work, wherein planet traps - specific sites in protoplanetary disks
at which planets undergoing rapid type I migration are captured -
play a crucial role. We will discuss how disk inhomogeneities, one of
the most general properties of planetary disks, give rise to planet
traps and how planet traps affect the formation and evolution of
planetary systems. Comparisons with a large number of observed
exoplanets enable us to verify our picture of planet formation based
on planet traps.
