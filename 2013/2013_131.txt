Dear all,

As Keiichi mentioned, we will have a colloquium talk by
prof. Mark Morris (UCLA) on Wednesday (tomorrow).
Please keep in mind the unusual date for colloquium.

And after the colloquium, we will take him to Din Tai Fung
for the colloquium dinner. If you are interested in joining
dinner, please let me finish counting by tomorrow noon.

Thanks,
Hyosun
