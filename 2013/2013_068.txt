Dear Colleagues,

You are cordially invited to attend the Joint Colloquium which will be held on April 16 .
The Joint Colloquium Series is organized by
the NTU Physics Department, Center for Condensed Matter Science (CCMS),
Leung Center for Cosmology and Particle Astrophysics (LeCosPA),
Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA),
and the Institute of Atomic and Molecular Sciences (IAMS).
The idea is to have excellent speakers to give inspiring, informative,
but non-technical talks on the frontiers of Sciences.

Enclosed below is the information of the Joint Colloquium on April 16 .

Best regards,

Pisin Chen (LeCosPA)
Ting-Wai Chiu (NTU-Phys)
Michitoshi Hayashi (CCMS)
Lain-Jong Li (IAMS)
Michihiro Takami (ASIAA)

ASIAA/CCMS/IAMS/LeCosPA/NTU-Physics Joint Colloquium
Speaker: Ting-Kuo Lee (李定國)
        (Distinguished Research Fellow and Director, Institute of Physics, Academia Sinica)
Topic : Unexpected physical properties of high temperature superconductors 
Time  : 04/16 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:10
Place : Room 104, CCMS-New Physics Building


Abstract :
    Since the discovery of high temperature superconductors, it has been demonstrated again and again that whenever better samples are prepared and more sophisticated and higher accuracy measurements are used, there is always a new surprise, for example: s-wave paring is changed to d-wave pairing, spin-gap, Fermi arc and pseudogap, dichotomy of nodal and antinodal regions, inhomogeneous states like stripes and checker board,  large distribution of gap magnitudes, two gaps in superconducting state, Fermi surface pockets, time reversal symmetry broken without breaking translational symmetry,  phase fluctuation vs. Gaussian fluctuation, etc.. In this talk, I shall speculate the reason for this complexity in cuprates based on our understanding of the solutions of the t-J model. In particular I shall use our recent works on stripes and phase fluctuation as examples.
