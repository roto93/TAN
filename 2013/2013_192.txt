Dear colleagues,

Please find the 2nd circular of the coming HSC/AGN meeting to be held
in Jan. 2014 in ASIAA. All of you, especially "non-HSC but AGN"
astronomers. "HSC but non-AGN" astronomers, and "non-HSC and non-AGN"
astronomers, are welcome to join it.

Regards.
Youichi

Dear HSC collaborators,

This is the second circular of a HSC-AGN face-to-face meeting in
January 2014 in ASIAA, Taiwan. Any related researchers including
galaxy people, transient people, hardware and software people,
and so on, are welcome to join in.

Best regards,

Tohru Nagao

Second Circular: Quasar science with HSC: toward the first results


==============================
14-16 January 2014
Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Academia Sinica (ASIAA),
Taipei, Taiwan
http://astro.edu.nagasaki-u.ac.jp/HSC-AGN2014/
http://events.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/meeting/20140114/
==============================


The formation and evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are
among the most exciting and challenging topics in astronomy and
astrophysics. New wide-field deep surveys are required to tackle
these issues, and Subaru's new wide-field camera (Hyper Suprime-Cam;
HSC) will bring promising opportunities to make breakthroughs in
this research field. Since the HSC-SSP (Subaru Strategic Program)
survey will start soon (in Spring 2014), it is a good time to have
an intensive face-to-face discussion among HSC collaboration
astronomers about scientific opportunities from the first-year data.

We will focus on doing science and writing papers based on the
first-year data of the coming HSC-SSP survey. These discussions in
advance of the start of the HSC-SSP survey will maximize the
scientific output in the theme of SMBH studies.

We will focus on the following topics, among others:
  -- Current status of the HSC operation plans, camera, and pipeline
  -- Commissioning run results and the data
  -- Survey plans and output photometric catalogs
  -- Quasar selection methods
  -- AGN photometric redshifts
  -- Statistics of quasars and SMBHs from the HSC data
  -- Co-evolution studies of SMBHs and galaxies with the HSC data
  -- Synergies of HSC and multi-wavelength data for SMBH studies
  -- Strategies for spectroscopic follow-up and the relation with PFS
  -- Theoretical preparations for HSC quasar surveys
  -- Action items for the HSC-SSP survey

The meeting will take place at Academia Sinica, Institute of Astronomy
and Astrophysics (ASIAA). The institute is located in the city of
Taipei, the capital of Taiwan, on the grounds of National Taiwan
University (*not* in the Academia Sinica Campus near Nan-Kang). The
weather in Taipei is typically fine and warm in January, and visitors
can enjoy nearby night markets (the nearest one is within walking
distance), historical places within the city, excellent museums, one
of the tallest skyscrapers in the world, and superb cuisine, all
accessible with a very convenient subway system.

The webform for the on-line registration and the abstract submission
is now open at the following URL (deadline: 30th November 2013):
http://events.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/meeting/20140114/

Note that there is no registration fee for participating in this
workshop. Participants from outside of Taipei may stay at the Howard
Hotel, which is located walking distance from ASIAA. Please indicate
your check-in and check-out dates on the registration webform by the
registration deadline, if you decide to stay in Howard Hotel, and
the meeting organizers will make your reservation for you. Please
DO NOT reserve your room(s) yourself.
Though the total available budget is limited, we will be able to
support travel expenses for some of the participants. People who
require travel support should indicated this on the registration
webform by the registration deadline.

The meeting will start in the morning on 14th Jan. Therefore we
would recommend you to arrive in Taipei by 13th Jan.
Detailed info of the venue and your travel are available on the
workshop webpages:

We are looking forward to seeing you in Taipei!
