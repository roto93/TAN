Dear Colleagues,

You are cordially invited to attend the Joint Colloquium which will be held
on December 10 (http://web.phys.ntu.edu.tw/colloquium/).

The Joint Colloquium Series is organized by the NTU Physics Department,
Center for Condensed Matter Science (CCMS), Leung Center for Cosmology and
Particle Astrophysics (LeCosPA), Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and
Astrophysics (ASIAA), and the Institute of Atomic and Molecular Sciences
(IAMS).

The idea is to have excellent speakers to give inspiring, informative, but
non-technical talks on the frontiers of Sciences.

Enclosed below is the information of the Joint Colloquium on December 10.

Best regards,

Yen-Ting Lin (ASIAA)
Michitoshi Hayashi (CCMS)
Chia-Lung Hsieh (IAMS)
Jiwoo Nam (LeCosPA)
Juinn-Wei Chen (NTU-Phys)

ASIAA/CCMS/IAMS/LeCosPA/NTU-Physics Joint Colloquium

Speaker: Cheng Chin

              (University of Chicago)

Topic :  *From Cosmology to Cold Atoms: **Observation of Sakharov Acoustic
Oscillations **in Quenched Atomic Superfluids*

Time  : 12/10 (Tue.) 14:20 - 15:20

Place : Room 104, CCMS-New Physics Building

Abstract:
    Sakharov acoustic oscillation, conventionally discussed in the context
of early universe evolution and the anisotropy of cosmic microwave
background radiation, is the manifestation of interfering acoustic waves
generated in an ideal fluid. We report a laboratory simulation of Sakharov
oscillations in an atomic superfluid by quenching the interactions between
atoms and monitoring the subsequent density fluctuations. Sakharov
oscillations are identified as the multi-peak structure in the density
fluctuations, resembling that of the cosmic microwave background radiation.
From the Sakharov oscillations, we determine the sonic horizon, providing
new perspectives to extend quantum simulation to other intriguing
cosmological and gravitational phenomena.

Brief Bio:
    Cheng Chin is a professor at the James Franck Institute, Enrico Fermi
Institute, and the Department of Physics at the University of Chicago. He
received his Ph.D. from Stanford University and completed his postdoc
research at Innsbruck University in Austria. He conducts experimental
research on ultracold atoms. He has received the Sloan Fellowship (2006),
Packard Fellowship (2006), OCPA Young Research Award (2006), NSF CAREER
Award (2008), IUPAP Young Scientists Prize (2008), I. I. Rabi Prize (2011)
and Humboldt Fellowship (2013).
