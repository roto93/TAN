The First Announcement of The 9th East Asian Meeting of Astronomy (EAMA9)


Time: October 14-18, 2013
Place: National Central University, Taoyuan, Taiwan


Host Institutes: 
Graduate Institute of Astronomy, National Central University

Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Academia Sinica


(website:http://events.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/meeting/20131014/index.php)



  The EAMA, East Asian Meeting on Astronomy, has more than two decades of history in the promotion and organization for the cooperation of astronomical efforts in the East Asian region. Since the formation of EACOA, the East Asian Core Observatories Association in 2005, EAMA is one of our principal sponsored activities. During the past eight EAMA meetings, fruitful discussions and interactions among regional astronomers have greatly promoted the astronomical research, education, and public outreach in East Asia. The 9th-EAMA meeting is being held in Taiwan, and we look forward to further growth in our cooperation and collaborations.

  Since the 8th-EAMA meeting held in Shanghai, many large astronomical projects involving East Asian research institutes have been put into operation (ALMA, Subaru HSC, LAMOST, KVN), or are under construction (FAST, Shanghai 65m, Subaru PFS, TAOS-2, GLT), or are being planned (GMT, TMT, SKA, SPICA). The 9th-EAMA meeting will be a good opportunity for the astronomers in East Asia to share their achievements in research, experiences in projects, and ideas for future astronomy. We sincerely invite you to join us.

Abstract: http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/activity/colloquium.php

*** Colloquium
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Mar Mezcua (Instituto de Astrofç©©sica de Canarias (IAC))
Topic:        SUPERMASSIVE BINARY BLACK HOLE SYSTEMS
Time:        6/28 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
It is widely accepted that galaxies are not isolated objects in the Universe, but are rather observed to undergo galaxy merging. If nearly all galaxies host a supermassive black hole in their center, it is expected that pairs of supermassive black holes will be formed in the course of a merger event. The detection and number estimates of binary black hole systems can, thus, help us to understand how galaxies form and grow, and shed light on the evolutionary models that rule the Universe.

In this Colloquium I will present observational evidence for binary black hole systems in three kinds of extragalactic objects: X-shaped radio galaxies, ultraluminous X-ray sources, and double nucleus galaxies. I will detail our observations and analyses of these systems and the conclusions obtained when combined all observational data.
