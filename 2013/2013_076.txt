            Astronomy Colloquium
#############################################

      2:20 p.m. 26th April 2013 (Friday)
        NTHU Physics Building, Rm620

      Speaker: Dr. Hau-Yu Liu

      Title:  Stochastically Fueling the AGN Dust Toroid vis
              Highly Turbulent Gas Streams ?
      Abstract:
I will present the Green Bank 100m Telescope mapping
observations of CS 1-0, and the SMA 157-pointings mosaic of the
submillimeter dust continuum emission as well as several warm and
dense gas tracers, in the central ~20 pc area in Galactic Center.

These observations resolved several filamentary gas streams which
follow highly eccentric Keplerian orbits around the central
supermassive black hole (SMBH) Sgr A* and the 2-4 pc scale
circumnuclear disk (CND). Some of these gas streams appear to be
well connected with the CND. Rather than being a quasi-stationary
structure, the CND may be dynamically evolving, incorporating the
inflow via exterior gas streams, and feeding gas toward the center.


    Tea/Discussion Time is followed in the same room.

                    All Welcome !!
