Dear Prof. Kuan, 

I should appreciate it if you could advertise the following workshop 
on TAN.  Although I advertised the excursion deadline (Feb 7) 
to some institutes (e.g., ASIAA, NTHU), I forgot to send it to TAN. 

Thank you very much.

SOC and LOC: http://UM2013.cfht.hawaii.edu/socloc.php 

SOC contact: um2013soc@cfht.hawaii.edu 

LOC contact: um2013loc@cfht.hawaii.edu 

              In addition, CFHT recently released an Announcement of 
Opportunity (AO) to develop new capabilities for the Observatory – 

http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/en/news/AO_2013/index.php 

              In support of this AO the UM will feature a town-hall 
session featuring presentations by teams intending to submit 
development proposals in addition to hosting a community discussion of 
the possible future directions to be taken by the Observatory. The 
10th CFHT UM therefore represents an important opportunity for the 
community to reflect upon the considerable scientific achievements of 
the observatory and its users in addition to engaging actively in the 
discussion of our future path. 

                                              Aloha, 

                                                              Doug
