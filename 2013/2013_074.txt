*** Colloquium
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Satoko Takahashi (ASIAA)
Topic:        Millimeter and Sbumillimeter studies of the Orion Molecular Filaments
Time:        4/26 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
I will present high angular resolution and wide-field interferometric continuum observations of the Orion Molecular Cloud (OMC) utilizing the Submilllimeter Array (SMA) and Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA), covering 25'/3.1 pc length of the the northern part of the OMC filaments. We detect at least 69 spatially resolved continuum sources associated with OMC filamentary structures through thermal dust emission. Their estimated masses and a projected source sizes range from 0.09 to 5.8 solar masses  and 1010 to 19000 AU, respectively. An analysis based on the Jeans theorem  suggests that these sources are most likely gravitationally unstable. Comparison of multi-wavelength datasets indicates that approximately half of the detected continuum sources are associated with outflows, infrared sources, and ionized jets. These sources show the evolutionary stage from prestellar core to Class 0/ I phases. We found the source separation within the OMC filaments peaked at  0.02 pc and 0.05!
  pc. This spatial distribution is part of a larger hierarchical structure, that also includes fragmentation scales of GMCs ( 5 degree/ 37 pc), large-scale clumps (1.3 pc), small-scale clumps (0.3 pc). This suggests that hierarchical fragmentation operates within the Orion A molecular cloud. Fragmentation spacings are roughly consistent with the local thermal fragmentation length in large-scale clumps ( 0.3 pc), while fragmentation spacings in dense cores measured from the SMA observations is smaller than the local fragmentation length. These smaller observed spacings can be explained by either that helical magnetic field or global filament collapse.

This will be my last talk in IAA before I leave Taiwan. I also would like to make summary of my research projects and project experiences at IAA in the past years.
