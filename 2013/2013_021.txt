Arizona Radio Observatory: Call for Proposals (Spring 2013) 
------------------------------------------------------------ 

Dear all, 

Proposals from members of the University Consortium of ALMA-Taiwan and 
ASIAA, for observing time are being solicited for the period February 25, 
2013 ¡V June 15, 2013, at the Arizona Radio Observatory, for the Sub- 
Millimeter Telescope (SMT) and the Kitt Peak 12 Meter (12M). The proposal 
deadline of UCAT/ASIAA for this 2013 spring semester is set on February 21, 
2013 (Thursday). 

The SMT currently supports a dual-polarization, 1 mm receiver with ALMA Band- 
6 sideband-separating mixers, a dual-polarization 0.8 mm receiver, and a 0.4 
mm (602¡V720 GHz) dual-polarization receiver with ALMA Band-9 mixers. A new 
Band 8 (385¡V500 GHz) receiver will also be available for limited 
observations. The SMT control system has been updated to allow for dual 
polarization, dual sideband observations (so-called "4 IF mode"). The 12M 
supports a dual-polarization 3 mm receivers (82¡V116 GHz) that employs ALMA 
Band-3 sideboard-separating mixers, as well as dual polarization, single 
sideband receivers for the lower part of the 3 mm window (65-86 GHz) and at 
2 mm (130-180 GHz). Due to likely equipment upgrades, availability of the 12 
m may be limited. Remote observing is available at both ARO telescopes. 

Please refer to http://aro.as.arizona.edu/ for more details. Information 
about Remote Observing can be found at: 
http://aro.as.arizona.edu/remote/remote.htm. 
For further information about remote observing and other operational 
questions, please contact Tom Folkers, Operations Manager: 
tfolkers@email.arizona.edu 

Proposals should consist of: 
1. A proposal Cover Sheet, obtainable at http://aro.as.arizona.edu/proposals. 
2. A brief scientific and technical justification (no more than 2 pages). 
3. A source list with observing time requirements and justification, and/or 
tables, figures and references (no more than 1 page in total). Note Sun 
Avoidance Zones. 
4. Provide the IP number of the computer you will be using during your 
observations. 

Please pay special attention to the ¡§Sun Avoidance Zone¡¨ issue of your 
proposed observations. The SMT will not be pointed to within 42 degrees of 
the Sun, and the 12M, 15 degrees. 

Electronic submissions will be accepted in PDF format only. Scheduling of 
successful proposals will be done according to availability of the receivers 
requested. 
Please submit your proposals by midnight (23:59 pm CST) February 21, 2013 to: 
kuan AT asiaa.sinica.edu.tw. 

Kind regards, 
Yi-Jehng Kuan 
on behalf of UCAT's ARO TAC

*** Special Seminar
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Nicole Czakon (Caltech)
Topic:        The Bolocam Sunyaev-Zel'dovich(SZ) Observing Program: X-ray/SZ Scaling
Relations
Time:        2/4 (Monday) 15:00 - 16:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
Galaxy clusters have become promising probes of cosmology thanks to
recent advances in instrumentation.  Both galaxy cluster surveys and
pointed galaxy cluster observations provide insight into the nature of
dark energy and dark matter. A variety of physical phenomena generate
cluster observables which span from radio to X-ray. To use galaxy
clusters for cosmology, however, we must combine these different
wavelength observations, which scale independently with a cluster's
physical properties. One of these observables, the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich
(SZ) effect provides a lever arm to understand the baryonic content at
the outskirts of galaxy clusters. Caltech has contributed significantly
to the development of detectors and instrumentation to measure the
Sunyaev Zelâ€™dovich effect. The SZ observing program of one of the
instruments, Bolocam, has fully matured over the last year. Thanks in
large part to the ASIAA-branch of the CLASH program, our data has
contributed to a variety of cluster analyses. I will give an overview of
my work calibrating integrated SZ values with X-ray determined
masses. This work includes a detailed study of sources of systematic
error, including, selection function effects, large-scale signal
filtering, and alternative mass models. The full Bolocam X-ray SZ
catalog (BOXSZ) results are expected to be released early 2013.

Speaker:    Ching-Cheng Hsu (Laboratory for high energy physics, University of Bern)
Topic:        High Energy Particle Astrophysics with Cherenkov Telescopes
Time:        2/5 (Tuesday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
High Energy experimental particle astrophysics is now a field of growing interests and has been well established. It marks the intersection of astrophysics, particle physics and cosmology. In general, particle astrophysics has two main elements. One is multi-messenger astronomy and the other is fundamental physics with cosmic messengers. It opens new windows to the universe and provides us new approaches to understanding the fundamental properties of matter and the universe.  

The main focus of this talk is on the development of experimental techniques for Earth-bound Cherenkov gamma-ray and neutrino detectors. Consequently, more emphasis is given to the physics results from these experiments, particularly on the physics of Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) and related subjects. At last, the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) project which is a worldwide effort experiment on Tera-electronvolt gamma-ray astronomy in the next decade will be introduced. In addition, I will also discuss the prospective CTA physics impacts on AGN research.
