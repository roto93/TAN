Dear Colleagues,

You are cordially invited to attend the Joint Colloquium which will be held
on October 1.

The Joint Colloquium Series is organized by the NTU Physics Department,
Center for Condensed Matter Science (CCMS), Leung Center for Cosmology and
Particle Astrophysics (LeCosPA), Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and
Astrophysics (ASIAA), and the Institute of Atomic and Molecular Sciences
(IAMS).

The idea is to have excellent speakers to give inspiring, informative, but
non-technical talks on the frontiers of Sciences.

Enclosed below is the information of the Joint Colloquium on October 1.

Best regards,

Yen-Ting Lin (ASIAA)
Michitoshi Hayashi (CCMS)
Lain-Jong Li (IAMS)
Jiwoo Nam (LeCosPA)
Juinn-Wei Chen (NTU-Phys)

Topic : Interpreting the Warming

Time  : 10/01 (Tue.) 14:20 - 15:10

Place : Room 104, CCMS-New Physics Building

Abstract:
    Global warming is one of the hottest environmental issues in recent
years, partly because of the observed warming trend since the early
20th century
and repeatedly occurring extreme events such heat waves and record-breaking
rainfall. Many of these phenomena have been attributed to the increasing
anthropogenic greenhouse effect since the Industrial Revolution. The
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in its Fourth Assessment Report
on Climate Change (2007) confirmed that =E2=80=9Cmost of the observed incre=
ase in
global average temperature since the mid-20th century is very likely due to
the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations=E2=80=
=9D and
projected further 1.8-4=C2=BAC warming by the end of the 21st century. On t=
he
other hand, there are continuing arguments and reports against the
attribution of the observed warming and increasing extreme events to the
anthropogenic greenhouse effect. How do we interpret the mixed information?
What are the scientific bases for the IPCC reports? How reliable is the
future climate projection? This talk will briefly summarize my person view
on these issues and the major scientific findings of the IPCC Fifth
Assessment Report scheduled to release on 27 September 2013.

Brief Bio:

Dr. Huang-Hsiung Hsu was an associate professor and professor at the
Department of Atmospheric Sciences, National Taiwan University from 1989 to
2011. He joined the Research Center for Environmental Changes, Academia
Sinica in August 2011. His research interest includes atmospheric general
circulation, Asian monsoon, climate variation and change, and climate
dynamics. He has been leading a 5=E2=80=93year NSC project =E2=80=9CConsort=
ium for Climate
Change Study=E2=80=9D since August 2011 to implement and develop an Earth S=
ystem
Modeling system in Taiwan. He is also a co-PI of the NSC =E2=80=9CTaiwan Cl=
imate
Change Information and Projection=E2=80=9D Project. Dr. Hsu was a lead auth=
or in
the following two NSC reports: Scientific Report on Typhoon Morakot (

Topic:        Recent results from the Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies
Time:        10/1 (Tuesday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1108
Abstract:
The S4G survey is an imaging survey of 2331 nearby galaxies using 
the Spitzer telescope at 3.6 and 4.5 $\mu$m. At these wavelengths
the dominant contribution to the stellar light comes from red giant
stars, but there is still light from several younger stellar 
components, as well as radiation from dust. I will give an overview
of the project, and describe first results in several areas. These
include studies of thin and thick disks of spiral galaxies, where
we find evidence for a more important contribution of the thick
disk in galaxies with small rotational velocities, disk truncation
studies (both in the thin disk and in the thick disk), and studies
of galaxies showing various signs of interactions. I will also 
discuss the possibility of creating stellar mass maps from the 
Spitzer data alone. Such maps are in principle useful for calculating
non-axisymmetric potentials, and permit, if realistic, more detailed
modelling of disk galaxies.
