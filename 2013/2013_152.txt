Arizona Radio Observatory: Call for Proposals (Fall 2013)
------------------------------------------------------------
Dear Astronomers in Taiwan,

Observing proposals from members of the University Consortium of ALMA-Taiwan
(UCAT) and ASIAA for the 10-meter Sub-Millimeter Telescope (SMT), located on
Mount Graham, of the Arizona Radio Observatory (ARO) are being solicited for the
period October 15, 2013 - January 31, 2014. The proposal deadline of UCAT/ASIAA
for this 2013 fall semester is set on September 17, 2013 (Tuesday).

The SMT currently supports a dual-polarization, 1 mm receiver (215-280 GHz) with
ALMA Band 6 sideband-separating (SBS) mixers, a dual-polarization 0.8 mm
(320-370 GHz) receiver, and a 0.4 mm (602-720 GHz) dual-polarization receiver
with ALMA Band 9 mixers. A new 0.7 mm (420-500 GHz) dual-polarization receiver
incorporating sideband-separating mixers will be available as well. The SMT
control system supports both dual polarization ("2 IF mode"), and dual
polarization, dual sideband observations ("4 IF mode"), as well as OTF mapping.
Remote observing is available http://aro.as.arizona.edu/remote/remote.htm .
Graduate student participation is especially encouraged.

Proposals should consist of:
1. A proposal Cover Sheet, obtainable at http://aro.as.arizona.edu/proposals .
2. A brief scientific and technical justification (no more than 2 pages).
3. A source list with observing time requirements and justification, and/or
    tables, figures and references (no more than 1 page in total).
4. Observers that plan to observe remotely must supply fixed IP address(es) of
    the computer(s) that will be used during observing on the cover sheet of
    the proposal.

Proposers are required to list on the cover sheet their requested observing
blocks (LST ranges), dates which they are not available to observe, and dates in
which sources in those observing blocks are within the Sun Avoidance Zone (the
SMT will not be pointed to sources within 44 degrees from the Sun).

Proposers should consult the ARO website http://aro.as.arizona.edu/ for
technical specifications. For further information about remote observing and
other operational questions, contact Tom Folkers, Operations Manager
tfolkers@email.arizona.edu .

Electronic submissions will be accepted in PDF format only. Scheduling of
successful proposals will be done according to availability of the receivers
requested. The final proposal pdf file should be emailed to
kuan@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw by  midnight (23:59 pm CST) September 17, 2013.


Kind regards,
Yi-Jehng Kuan
on behalf of UCAT's ARO TAC

Dear colleagues

The 9th East-Asian Meeting on Astrophysics (EAMA9) will be held
October 14 to 17 at NCU.  The series of the conferences aims to bring
together experts in the EA region, mainly from Korea, Japan, China and
Taiwan, to exchange experiences and ideas, and more importantly, to
foster collaborations.

On behalf of the organizing staff, I would like to encourage you to
sign up for the meeting and better yet to contribute to the scientific
program.  You can find information following this link,
  http://events.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/meeting/20131014/

A block of rooms at the university guest house have been reserved
for domestic participants.  If you need to book such a room,
please contact the LOC via
eama2013_loc@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw<http://events.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/meeting/20131014/>

See you at NCU.

Wen Ping

"The Planck Satellite as a Large Scale Structure Survey"

Planck is the third-generation satellite aimed at measuring the cosmic microwave background, the oldest electromagnetic radiation in the Universe, coming to us from just 400,000 years after the hot big bang. Launched in May 2009, Planck has surveyed the full sky at high sensitivity and high angular resolution from 30 to 857 GHz. This broad frequency coverage gives Planck a unique view of the history of the Universe from the epoch of recombination to the present. I will present the Planck latest cosmological results, with an emphasis on Planck's sensitivity to the low redshift Universe through, e.g., the lensing of the cosmic microwave background.

"Cosmology at Sub-mm Wavelengths: From Herschel to CCAT and Beyond"

I will summarize key science results obtained so far by two key programs that made use of the SPIRE instrument aboard the Herschel Space Observatory. These extragalactic surveys have uncovered close to a million dusty, starburst galaxies at redshifts of 1 to 5 with instantaneous star-formation rates out to several thousand solar masses per year in some cases. I will discuss properties of Herschel-selected bright and lensed sub-mm galaxies, their dust and molecular gas properties, the spatial clustering of bright and faint sub-mm galaxies, and the role of dusty starbursts in galaxy formation and evolution. I will discuss unresolved fluctuations as a way to study the fainter galaxies below the confusion limit. I will briefly introduce intensity mapping of sub-mm/far-IR spectral lines as a way to probe large-scale structure and the epoch of reionization and will end my talk with some discussion of future directions in sub-mm wavelength observations with ALMA, CCAT and SPICA.

"Probing the Epoch of Reionization with Intensity Mapping"

Star formation during the epoch of reionization may be studied through
measurements of intensity fluctuations in the redshifted 158 um line of
singly ionized carbon.  Intensity mapping is an attractive approach to
measure galaxy clustering and its relation to underlying dark matter halos,
without resolving individual galaxies with a large aperture telescope.  The
technique has had several notable successes in continuum band measurements
with Planck and Herschel/SPIRE, and is also being used in the near-infrared
with Spitzer, Akari and CIBER to study the components of the extragalactic
background.  The Tomographic Ionized-carbon Mapping Experiment (TIME) will
measure 3-dimensional line intensity variations using a large focal plane
array of mm-wave spectrometers, coupled to a wide-field dedicated 3 - 10
meter telescope.  We are currently developing spectrometers lithographed on
a compact silicon chip based on low-loss superconducting RF circuitry,
similar to the antenna structures currently used in CMB polarimeters, that
enables mass production for large spectroscopic throughput.  We are also
developing a precursor instrument named TIME-Pilot based on conventional
spectrometer technology that can make a first detection of C+ fluctuations
at predicted levels in a modest dedicated survey from the 10 meter Caltech
Submillimeter Observatory.
