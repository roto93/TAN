Dear Colleagues,

You are cordially invited to attend the Joint Colloquium which will be held
on November 12 (
http://web.phys.ntu.edu.tw/jwc/2013_Fall_colloquia/Joint%20colloquia%20fall=
%202013.html
,backup
site:
http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~d01222003/Seminar3/Joint%20colloquia%20fall%202=
013.html
).

The Joint Colloquium Series is organized by the NTU Physics Department,
Center for Condensed Matter Science (CCMS), Leung Center for Cosmology and
Particle Astrophysics (LeCosPA), Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and
Astrophysics (ASIAA), and the Institute of Atomic and Molecular Sciences
(IAMS).

The idea is to have excellent speakers to give inspiring, informative, but
non-technical talks on the frontiers of Sciences.

Enclosed below is the information of the Joint Colloquium on November 12.

Best regards,

Yen-Ting Lin (ASIAA)
Michitoshi Hayashi (CCMS)
Lain-Jong Li (IAMS)

ASIAA/CCMS/IAMS/LeCosPA/NTU-Physics Joint Colloquium

Speaker: Ue-Li Pen (=B4^=AB=C2=C2=A7 =B1=D0=B1=C2)

            (Associate Director, Canadian Institute for Theoretical
Astrophysics)

Topic : Astrophysical Tests of Quantum Gravity

Time  : 11/12 (Tue.) 14:20 - 15:20

Place : Room 104, CCMS-New Physics Building

Abstract:
I discuss possible observational consequences of quantum black holes. This
year, the first pulsar in orbit about a black hole was discovered. We argue
that some solutions to Hawking's information loss problem, for example
fuzzballs, may result in changes of lensed pulsar coherence, analogous to
the Aharonov-Bohm effect. We speculate on future experimental technologies
which may improve the observational prospects.

Brief Bio:
Prof. Pen is a world renown cosmologist, working on a wide variety of
topics ranging from cosmic string and topological defects,
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich simulations, gravitational lensing, cosmic reionization
and MHD simulations. He is also an expert on numerical simulation
techniques and parallel computing. He was a NTU undergrad in math, obtained
his PhD from Princeton University in 1995, and was a Harvard University
Junior Fellow before joining the faculty at the University of Toronto and
the Canadian Institute of Theoretical Astrophysics (CITA) in 1998. He is
currently a Canadian Institute for Advanced Research senior fellow and the
associate director of CITA. Recently his research is focused on
cosmological applications of the hydrogen hyperfine transition 21-cm line,
and pulsar scattering phenomena.

ADDITIONAL INFO!!

(1) Cycle 1 Duplication Checklist (added on Nov 6)
http://almascience.nao.ac.jp/proposing/call-for-proposals/duplications

Cycle 2 proposals will be checked for duplication against successful =
Cycle 1=20
(though not Cycle 0) projects. The duplication criteria are given in
Section 7.2.2 of the Proposer's Guide:
<http://almascience.org/proposing/call-for-proposals/proposers-guide#PG
Sect7.2.2>.

Cycle 2 PIs should avoid proposing the same targets with similar =
observational=20
parameters in their Cycle 2 proposals, or should explain clearly why the
proposed observations would not constitute a duplication.

(2) Observations of monitoring or predictable events with ACA.
The ACA restriction listed in Section 9 of the=20
"ALMA Capabilities page"
http://almascience.nao.ac.jp/proposing/call-for-proposals/capabilities
does not apply to observations of phenomena with predictable times and =
for
monitoring projects...
Please check Knowledgebase article titled
"If I observe a predictable phenomenon, is my project considered time =
constrained?"

      Title: Super-Luminous Supernovae:
            Giant Supernovae in Dwarf Hosts

      Abstract:
In this talk, I will introduce the supernova studies at QUB, our basic
understanding of super-luminous supernovae and their host galaxies
from several precious events, such as SN2010gx and PTF-12dam. We
have found the host of SN2010gx to have a remarkably low
metallicity (equal to 0.06 solar metallicity) as determined from
the detection of the [OIII] f4363 line.

We keep collecting more host galaxy samples, if the low
metallicity is a common factor among them, it will be a major
constraint on the progenitor channel of super-luminous supernovae,
and also helps to explain the low intrinsic rates (~10^-4 of the
core-collapse population) of the super-luminous supernovae detected
so far.

    Tea/Discussion Time is followed in the same room.

                  All Welcome !!

*** Colloquium
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Martha Boyer (GSFC)
Topic:        Towards Characterizing AGB Stars in the Magellanic Clouds
Time:        11/13 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
When low- to intermediate-mass stars (0.8 < M < 8 M_sun) begin to
ascend the asymptotic giant branch (AGB), pulsations levitate material
from the stellar surface and provide density enhancements and shocks,
encouraging dust formation and re-processing. This dust is
subsequently released to the interstellar medium via a strong stellar
wind driven mainly by radiation pressure on the grains. This dusty
stellar wind causes AGB stars to radiate strongly in the near- to
mid-infrared, potentially affecting measurements of star-formation
histories of distant galaxies at these wavelengths.  The Spitzer
Surveying the Agents of Galaxy Evolution (SAGE) survey of the
Magellanic Clouds produced the first large-scale unbiased infrared
observations of a large sample of AGB stars, enablng investigations
into the dust production, the stellar evolution, and the luminosity
contribution from these important stars. I will discuss some of the
the SAGE AGB findings, and how the lessons from SAGE are being applied
to investigations of AGB stars in other galaxies.

Dear All,

        We would like to remind you the following 2 ALMA-T activities =
this week and next week:

      1) Proposal Writing Camp

    The Taiwan ARC node will host an ALMA Proposal Writing Camp at =
ASIAA. The purpose is to help users sharpen and polish the proposals =
well before the deadline for the mock review as well as the final =
submission. The camp will be held on Nov 14, 15, and 18 from 9am to 5pm =
on each day in room 1107. One to two ARC members will be one-site for =
providing technical advices, and an English editor will be around for =
grammatical suggestions.

    2) Mock Proposal Review

    As in previous cycles, a mock proposal review for Taiwan users =
will be held to encourage prospective users get the proposals prepared =
early.  All Taiwanese users are welcome to submit their proposals. Full =
proposal, including scientific and technical justification, figures and =
tables, is required for the review; technical and scientific comments =
will feedback to the PIs afterwards so that PIs can incorporate the =
comments into proposal revision before their final submission.
    The proposal submission deadline for the mock review will be on =
Nov 19th, and feedbacks to the PIs will be provided on Nov 26th.

Best,
