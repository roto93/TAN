    The Life Cycle of Dust in the Universe:
    Observations, Theory, and Laboratory Experiments

    November 18-22, 2013, Taipei, Taiwan

    http://events.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/meeting/20131118/

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT UPCOMING DEADLINES:

The deadline for early registration is on 24 August. Please submit
your registration form and complete your payment before the deadline
totake advantage of the reduced registration fee.

The deadline to submit abstracts for contributed talks is also on
24 August.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

OBJECTIVES:

This meeting aims to address the life cycle of dust in the Universe,
which covers the formation, evolution and destruction of dust in a
range of environments, ranging from the smallest to the largest
scales. Bringing together observational and theoretical
astrophysicists as well as meteoriticists and experimentalists will
allow for a cross-disciplinary dialogue.

The meeting follows a successful tradition of astrophysical dust
meetings, starting in Albany in 1972, with the latest edition "Cosmic
Dust: Near and Far" organized by Th. Henning taking place in
Heidelberg in 2008.

Since that meeting, the field of dust astrophysics has made major
leaps forward with the hoist of data arriving from such missions as
the infrared space telescopes Spitzer, Herschel, and Stardust, the
latter returning dust samples from comet Wild-2 currently being
studied in the lab. The largest telescope on Earth, ALMA, has recently
come online, allowing for investigations into the origin of dust in
the Universe. Thus, this is an excellent time to review the status of
the field of dust astrophysics in this meeting.

The meeting aims to create an environment in which all aspects of the
life cycle of dust will be discussed, from an astrophysical, chemical
and mineralogical perspective, and the effect on a range of
environments. Observational insights, theoretical models and
experimental approaches all contribute to our view of the life cycle
of dust, and the meeting will address new developments and future
projects in all these areas.

VENUE:

International Conference Hall,
Humanities and Social Sciences Building, 3F, Academia Sinica
128 Academia Road, Section 2, Nankang, Taipei, Taiwan

The meeting is held on the Academis Sinica (AS) main campus, which is
different from the National Taiwan University (NTU) campus where

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROCEEDINGS:

We plan to publish conference proceedings.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

EXCURSIONS:

Through a local tour agency, we will offer two excursions, which can
be booked separately from the conference registration.

On Wednesday afternoon (20 November), we will visit the famous eroded
coast of Yeliu with its beautiful rock formations, followed by a visit
to the night market of Keelung.

On the weekend after the conference (23 & 24 November), a two-day trip
to Taroko Gorge will be offered. This scenic canyon on Taiwan's east
coast is definitely worth a visit!

The registration for these excursions is currently open. More
information can be found on the "Travel Guide" section of the
conference website:

ISOTOPE WORKSHOP & NANOSIMS INAUGURATION:

After the conference on "The Life Cycle of Dust in the Universe:
Observations, Theory and Laboratory Experiments", there will be a
2-day workshop at Academia Sinica on 25 and 26 November 2013 in honour
of Typhoon Lee's 65th birthday, celebrating his contributions to the
field of meteoritics and dust astrophysics. This will also be the
inauguration meeting for Academia Sinica's NanoSIMS facility.

The registration for this meeting is currently open, and more information
can be obtained from Ming-Chang Liu (mcliu@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw).

Abstract: http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/activity/colloquium.php

*** Colloquium
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Srinivasan Sundar (ASIAA)
Topic:        An inventory of hidden dust from extremely red evolved stars
Time:        8/16 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
The injection of metal-rich material from dusty red supergiants (RSGs) and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars drives the chemical evolution of galaxies and the formation of the next generation of stars. It is therefore critical to constrain the dust budget from these evolved objects. Over the past few years, our group has used multi-wavelength information to estimate the total dust injection rate from RSG and AGB stars in the Magellanic Clouds.

As part of our studies, we found that most of the dust (>75%) comes from a small fraction (~5%) of very dusty stars. However, the most evolved of these sources are so obscured by dust that they do not have optical or near-infrared counterparts. These extremely red objects (EROs) are thus only visible at mid-infrared and longer wavelengths. A preliminary analysis of the recently discovered extreme carbon stars in the Large Magellanic cloud (Gruendl et al. 2008) using archival Spitzer data from the SAGE program (Meixner et al. 2006) shows that these sources do indeed have very high dust production rates. The detection of such sources is therefore an important step in the determination of the dust budget.

In this talk, I will summarise our work on the dust budget so far, and present our ongoing inventory of ERO candidates in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, as well as in M33. I will also discuss a possible search for these objects in our own Galaxy.
