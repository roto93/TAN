Dear Colleagues,

You are cordially invited to attend the Joint Colloquium which will be held on May 14 .
The Joint Colloquium Series is organized by
the NTU Physics Department, Center for Condensed Matter Science (CCMS),
Leung Center for Cosmology and Particle Astrophysics (LeCosPA),
Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA),
and the Institute of Atomic and Molecular Sciences (IAMS).
The idea is to have excellent speakers to give inspiring, informative,
but non-technical talks on the frontiers of Sciences.

Enclosed below is the information of the Joint Colloquium on May 14.

Best regards,

Pisin Chen (LeCosPA)
Ting-Wai Chiu (NTU-Phys)
Michitoshi Hayashi (CCMS)
Lain-Jong Li (IAMS)
Michihiro Takami (ASIAA)

Abstract :
    In the last decade, super-resolution techniques, including stimulated emission depletion (STED), structured illumination, and localization scheme, have revolutionized optical microscopy and related applications. The spatial resolution has now achieved a few tens of nanometers, greatly surpassing the Abbe’s diffraction limit and allowing unprecedented imaging of micro-structures, particularly in life sciences.
    This presentation will discuss the working principles, the challenges, and the implications following the above advancements.
