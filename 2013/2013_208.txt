Dear All,

  Here is a kind reminder for ALMA-T Mock Proposal submission deadline.

  (see also http://alma.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/proposals_cycle02.php#mock)
  The Taiwan ARC node will hold a mock review of ALMA proposals for =
Cycle 2, as for Cycle 1. In Cycle 1, the over-subscription rate was =
about 6. In Cycle 2, the over-subscription rate may be about the same. =
Thus, only very well-prepared proposals will succeed. Prospective users =
should have their proposals prepared now.

Proposals fail sometimes due to 1) unclear science questions or goals =
and/or poorly designed experimenting methods/approaches, but also often =
due to 2) poor writing or last minute compilation. The purpose of this =
review is to improve the quality of ALMA-T proposals for better success =
rate by enforcing potential users to prepare the proposals early, thus, =
to at least eliminate the last minute writing and to further sharpen the =
science ideas.

  This mock review is mainly targeted at new users, postdocs, and =
students in Taiwan. Nonetheless, all Taiwanese users are welcome to =
submit their proposals.

  The proposal submission deadline is 2013.11.19. Full proposal, =
including scientific and technical justification, figures and tables, is =
required to submit to arcasiaa.sinica.edu.tw in pdf format. Half-cooked =
proposals will benefit little from mock reviewing. Technical assessment =
will be carried out by the Taiwan ARC staff. Scientific review will be =
conducted through paper by a review panel, including Vivien Chen, Naomi =
Hirano, Sheng-Yuan Liu, Satoki Matsushita, Kazushi Sakamoto, and Wei-Hao =
Wang.

Technical and scientific review comments will feedback to the PIs =
through email a week later on 2013.11.26. Face-to-face discussion with =
the ARC staff or review panel members may be considered and arranged. =
PIs can incorporate these comments into proposal revision before "true" =
submission.

Best Wishes,
Chin-Fei
On behalf of Taiwan ARC node=
