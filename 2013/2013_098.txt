Dear Colleagues,

You are cordially invited to attend the Joint Colloquium which will be held on May 28 .
The Joint Colloquium Series is organized by
the NTU Physics Department, Center for Condensed Matter Science (CCMS),
Leung Center for Cosmology and Particle Astrophysics (LeCosPA),
Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA),
and the Institute of Atomic and Molecular Sciences (IAMS).
The idea is to have excellent speakers to give inspiring, informative,
but non-technical talks on the frontiers of Sciences.

Enclosed below is the information of the Joint Colloquium on May 28.

Best regards,

Pisin Chen (LeCosPA)
Ting-Wai Chiu (NTU-Phys)
Michitoshi Hayashi (CCMS)
Lain-Jong Li (IAMS)
Michihiro Takami (ASIAA)

ASIAA/CCMS/IAMS/LeCosPA/NTU-Physics Joint Colloquium
Speaker: Professor Andrew Fabian
        (University of Cambridge)
Topic : Astrophysical Black Holes
Time  : 05/28(Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:10
Place : Room 104, CCMS-New Physics Building


Abstract :
    Supermassive black holes are found at the centers of most galaxies and stellar mass black holes are common throughout galaxies. Observations of these astrophysical black holes will be presented and discussed. Evidence will be presented that supermassive black holes determine the final mass and shape of their host galaxies. The talk concludes with observations of the innermost regions around black holes and approaches to mapping down to the event horizon.


Brief Bio. :
      Professor Fabian has been active in professional astronomy since the early 1970s, having received his degrees from the University of London. His current areas of research include galaxy clusters, active galactic nuclei, strong gravity, black holes and the X-ray background. Much of his research involves X-ray astronomy and high energy astrophysics. He has used data from almost all cosmic X-ray satellites launched. He is a Royal Society Research Professor at the Institute of Astronomy, of the University of Cambridge (since 1982) and is the head of the X-ray astronomy group there. He was Vice-Master of Darwin College, Cambridge from 1997-2012. He has won several awards including the Dannie Heineman Prize for Astrophysics from the American Astronomical Society and the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society. He was the President of the Royal Astronomical Society from 2008-2010, and  Editor-in-Chief of the Astronomy Journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Soc!
iety from 1994-2008.
