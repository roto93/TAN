Topic:        Cosmic magnetism: magnetic fields and polarized radio emission from galaxy clusters and large-scale structure
Time:        3/1 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
Magnetic fields are present everywhere in the Universe, from substellar systems to large-scale structures, such as cosmic filaments, walls and voids. They are important in various  astrophysical aspects. Without them, stars cannot be formed, and quasars cannot shine. While we have some understanding of the properties of stellar-scale magnetic fields, our knowledge of magnetic fields beyond galactic scales is very primitive. The situation will however change with the coming of new instruments, e.g. the SKA. In this talk I will first present an overview on cosmic magnetism. Then I will show results of two recent studies on cosmic magnetic fields by my collaboration. The first is a MHD simulation study of the evolution of magnetic fields of cluster and larger scales. The second is an investigation of how polarized radiation is transported through magnetized inhomogeneous multi-phase cosmological media. I will discuss how these studies will help to improve our understanding of p!
roperties, evolution and origin of the cosmic magnetic fields. I will also discuss certain technical difficulties and obstacles that we need to overcome in order to properly diagnose magnetic fields in large cosmic structures.

Topic:        Results from the Subaru Telescope SEEDS Project: Direct Imaging of Exoplanets and Their Forming Disks
Time:        2/26 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:10
Place:        Room 104, CCMS-New Physics Building
Abstract:
Astronomers have successfully discovered a number of extrasolar planets over the last twenty years. Our interests are now focused on direct detection of exoplanets similar to Jupiter, Saturn and Earth, understanding the similarities or diversities of such planetary systems, and how they form and evolve. Recent advances in technology, infrared imaging and the construction of large telescopes have provided dramatic progress in such studies.
SEEDS (Strategic Explorations of Exoplanets and Disks) is an ongoing large survey for exoplanets and protoplanetary disks at Subaru, one of the largest optical and infrared telescopes in the world. We describe the outline of this survey and present results from its first three years, including the detection of several new planets/companions. We also show our discoveries of the detailed structures of protoplanetary disks, i.e., potential signposts of young planets.

Topic:        Capturing stars into galactic centre accretion disks
Time:        2/25 (Monday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
The high stellar densities in galactic centres, combined with an accretion disk around the massive black hole, mean that stars will inevitably interact with the disk. This interaction can cause stars to be captured into the disk and migrate inward in a process similar to planetary migration. In addition to growing the black hole, the final plunge of the star through the accretion disk and into the black hole will result in an observational signature of high energy x-rays and gamma-rays. I will present early results from the StarDisk model, developed as part of the Silk Road Project (NAOC), which will soon self-consistently model the stellar dynamics, hydrodynamics and the feedback between stars and gas in galactic centres.

Topic:        Dusty evolved stars at low metallicity
Time:        2/27 (Wednesday) 15:30 - 16:30
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
Stars on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) are thought to be responsible for the majority of the dust injected into the interstellar medium.  Infrared surveys on local group galaxies provide an ideal opportunity to investigate how the composition and quantity of dust produced by asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars depends on metallicity on a galactic scale. Here, I discuss recent work on dust production in nearby dwarf galaxies, with particular focus on oxygen-rich dust  in the Magellanic Clouds.
