Dear TAN colleagues,

Please find below the "First Circular: Quasar science with HSC: toward
the first results."

Your can also contact Youichi Ohyama @ ASIAA
(ohyama@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw) for any inquiries.

Regards,

14-16 January 2014
Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Academia Sinica (ASIAA),
Taipei, Taiwan

------------------------------


The formation and evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are
among the most exciting and challenging topics in astronomy and
astrophysics. New wide-field deep surveys are required to tackle
these issues, and Subaru's new wide-field camera (Hyper Suprime-Cam;
HSC) will bring promising opportunities to make breakthroughs in
this research field. Since the HSC-SSP (Subaru Strategic Program)
survey will start soon (in Spring 2014), it is a good time to have
an intensive face-to-face discussion among HSC collaboration
astronomers about scientific opportunities from the first-year data.

We will focus on doing science and writing papers based on the
first-year data of the coming HSC-SSP survey. These discussions in
advance of the start of the HSC-SSP survey will maximize the
scientific output in the theme of SMBH studies.

We will focus on the following topics, among others:
  -- Current status of the HSC operation plans, camera, and pipeline
  -- Commissioning run results and the data
  -- Survey plans and output photometric catalogs
  -- Quasar selection methods
  -- AGN photometric redshifts
  -- Statistics of quasars and SMBHs from the HSC data
  -- Co-evolution studies of SMBHs and galaxies with the HSC data
  -- Synergies of HSC and multi-wavelength data for SMBH studies
  -- Strategies for spectroscopic follow-up and the relation with PFS
  -- Theoretical preparations for HSC quasar surveys
  -- Action items for the HSC-SSP survey

The meeting will take place at Academia Sinica, Institute of Astronomy
and Astrophysics (ASIAA). The institute is located in the city of
Taipei, the capital of Taiwan, on the grounds of National Taiwan
University (*not* in the Academia Sinica Campus near Nan-Kang). The
weather in Taipei is typically fine and warm in January, and visitors
can enjoy nearby night markets (the nearest one is within walking
distance), historical places within the city, excellent museums, one
of the tallest skyscrapers in the world, and superb cuisine, all
accessible with a very convenient subway system.

Details of registration, abstract submission, travel info, and so on
will be announced in the second circular, which will be distributed
at the end of October. Though the total available budget is limited,
we will be able to support travel expenses for some of the
participants. More details on this travel support will be announced
in the second circular. If you have any questions, please feel free
to contact us (see below).

We plan to arrange your hotel reservations after gathering information
about your stay, which will be announced in the 2nd circular. We can
also help with visas, and therefore please let the LOC know as soon as
possible if you need it.

We are looking forward to seeing you in Taipei!
