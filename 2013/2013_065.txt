First Announcement of the 4th Fermi Asian Network (FAN) Workshop
http://www.physics.hku.hk/~astro/FAN4/Index.htm
------------------------------
July 8-12, 2013
The University of Hong Kong

We are delighted to announce the 4th Fermi Asian Network (FAN)
workshop. The FAN collaboration consists of high-energy
astrophysicists mainly from Taiwan, Hong Kong and Korea, and we are
aiming to answer some of the major astrophysical problems by using
Fermi data. Over the last two years, we have published a series of
papers with a focus on compact objects. In order to review our effort
and expand our collaboration, we will hold the 4th workshop in Hong
Kong. The core topics of the workshop will cover

* AGN/Galactic Center
* Diffuse gamma-ray sources
* Fermi transients
* Gamma-ray bursts
* Gamma-ray binaries
* Magnetars
* Millisecond pulsars
* Rotation powered pulsars
* Supernova remnants and pulsar wind nebulae
* Unidentified Fermi objects

The emphasis of this workshop will be on both discussions and formal
presentations. We will also hold a mini hand-on training course to
help students and postdoc to analyze Fermi data.

Invited Speakers:
Andrea Belfiore (UCSC)
Roberto Mignani (UCL)
Paul Ray (NRL)  TBD
Paulo Saz Parkinson (UCSC)
Patrick Slane (CfA)
Diego Torres (IEEC-CSIC)

Registration:
Everyone is invited to participate in this workshop. The registration
fee is USD200 and it could be waived upon request. You are encouraged
to make a contributed talk related to the workshop. The registration
deadline is on May 26, 2013. Due to the limited space, priority will
be given to those with contributed talks. Please visit
http://www.physics.hku.hk/~astro/FAN4/Index.htm for registration and
local information.

Please contact  Prof. K.S. Cheng (hrspksc@hku.hk) for any questions
