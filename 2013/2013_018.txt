Subaru Telescope, the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ) 
invites applications for one vacant position (assistant professor) to work for Subaru telescope, 
an optical-infrared telescope at the 4,200 m (13,460ft.) summit of Mauna Kea 
on the island of Hawaii. Subaru Telescope, NAOJ operates the Subaru telescope 
for open use observations, and is also active in the research and development 
for its future systems. In addition, Subaru Telescope is supporting Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) project, 
which would be the next large project at NAOJ. We are seeking an assistant professor who will play 
a central role in a) ensuring smooth and safe science operation of Subaru Telescope for open use observations; 
b) mapping the scientific roles of Subaru Telescope in the future TMT era; c) maintaining high levels of scientific outputs. 
See below for the duties, responsibilities and qualification of the position.


1. Summary of Duties and Responsibilities: The primary duties and responsibilities of this position focus on 

management of the smooth and safe science operation of the telescope to maximize scientific output 

from its open-use observations. They include playing a major role in the TMT’s future operation. 

They entail the following specific duties:



-      As Head of Science Operations under the Assistant Director of Operations at Subaru Telescope, 

      lead the scientific operations of the telescope and work closely with the Head of Engineering.

-      Play a central role in the discussion and identification of scientific priorities at Subaru Telescope, 

      while taking into account the key instrumentations in the next decade, such as Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC); 

      ensure continuity in the optimum scientific operation of the telescope in a way that leads to synergy 

      with the TMT Project; closely coordinate activities with the Subaru Principal Scientist.

-      Actively participate in planning the operation of the TMT and play a central role in implementing 

      this plan in the future.


In addition to these duties and responsibilities, the Assistant Professor will work the day-to-day operation of 

the telescope system and actively engage in his/her own research activities by using the Subaru Telescope.


2. Qualifications: The applicant must have demonstrated experience and knowledge in the areas of telescope 

and/or instrumentation development and/or operation. This background may include expertise with space telescopes 

and large experimental facilities as well as ground-based telescopes. The applicant also needs to have leadership skills 

in a multicultural work environment. These skills include the ability to interact and communicate effectively not only with 

engineering staff hired locally/internationally but also with those from Japan.


3. Compensation: The salary for the position depends upon the applicant’s experience and qualifications. 
NAOJ policies determine employee benefits, including relocation costs and support.

More information, including how to apply for the position, is available 
at http://www.subarutelescope.org/Announce/2013/01/16/index.html. 
More information on the Subaru telescope is also available at http://www.subarutelescope.org

I would encourage relevant researchers to apply for the position.


Best regards,
Nobuo Arimoto
Director of Subaru Telescope
