*** Colloquium
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Martha Boyer (GSFC)
Topic:        Towards Characterizing AGB Stars in the Magellanic Clouds
Time:        11/13 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
When low- to intermediate-mass stars (0.8 < M < 8 M_sun) begin to
ascend the asymptotic giant branch (AGB), pulsations levitate material
from the stellar surface and provide density enhancements and shocks,
encouraging dust formation and re-processing. This dust is
subsequently released to the interstellar medium via a strong stellar
wind driven mainly by radiation pressure on the grains. This dusty
stellar wind causes AGB stars to radiate strongly in the near- to
mid-infrared, potentially affecting measurements of star-formation
histories of distant galaxies at these wavelengths.  The Spitzer
Surveying the Agents of Galaxy Evolution (SAGE) survey of the
Magellanic Clouds produced the first large-scale unbiased infrared
observations of a large sample of AGB stars, enablng investigations
into the dust production, the stellar evolution, and the luminosity
contribution from these important stars. I will discuss some of the
the SAGE AGB findings, and how the lessons from SAGE are being applied
to investigations of AGB stars in other galaxies.

Topic:        astrophysical tests of quantum gravity
Time:        11/12 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:10
Place:        Room 104, CCMS-New Physics Building
Abstract:
I discuss possible observational consequences of quantum black holes.  This year, the first pulsar in orbit about a black hole was discovered.  We argue that some solutions to Hawking's information loss problem, for example fuzzballs, may result in changes of lensed pulsar coherence, analogous to the Aharonov-Bohm effect.  We speculate on future experimental technologies which may improve the observational prospects.
