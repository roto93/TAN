Dear colleagues

The 9th East-Asian Meeting on Astrophysics (EAMA9) will be held
October 14 to 17 at NCU.  The series of the conferences aims to bring
together experts in the EA region, mainly from Korea, Japan, China and
Taiwan, to exchange experiences and ideas, and more importantly, to
foster collaborations.

On behalf of the organizing staff, I would like to encourage you to
sign up for the meeting and better yet to contribute to the scientific
program.  You can find information following this link,

A block of rooms at the university guest house have been reserved
for domestic participants.  If you need to book such a room,
please contact the LOC via

See you at NCU.

Wen Ping
