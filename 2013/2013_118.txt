  The EAMA, East Asian Meeting on Astronomy, has more than two decades of history in the promotion and organization for the cooperation of astronomical efforts in the East Asian region. Since the formation of EACOA, the East Asian Core Observatories Association in 2005, EAMA is one of our principal sponsored activities. During the past eight EAMA meetings, fruitful discussions and interactions among regional astronomers have greatly promoted the astronomical research, education, and public outreach in East Asia. The 9th-EAMA meeting is being held in Taiwan, and we look forward to further growth in our cooperation and collaborations.

  Since the 8th-EAMA meeting held in Shanghai, many large astronomical projects involving East Asian research institutes have been put into operation (ALMA, Subaru HSC, LAMOST, KVN), or are under construction (FAST, Shanghai 65m, Subaru PFS, TAOS-2, GLT), or are being planned (GMT, TMT, SKA, SPICA). The 9th-EAMA meeting will be a good opportunity for the astronomers in East Asia to share their achievements in research, experiences in projects, and ideas for future astronomy. We sincerely invite you to join us.
