  Title: Modelling the X-ray Spectra of AGN
          with a Relativistic Reflection Model

  Abstract:
X-ray emission from accreting black hole systems provide information
on the accretion geometry of the innermost region of the black hole.
Observational evidence indicates that black hole systeare consisted
of an accretion disc around a central black hole with a hot illuminating 
corona above the disc plane. The resulting X-ray spectra
can be decomposed by a powerlaw continuum, a reflection component and
a thermal disc component if the accretion is hot. This talk mainly
focuses on modelling the X-ray spectra of active galactic 
nuclei (AGN) and how to extract information on the black hole spin
and source geometry from reflection features. Spectra of 
the famous Type 1 AGN will be presented.
