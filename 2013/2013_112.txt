*** Colloquium
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Freeke van de Voort (ASIAA)
Topic:        Feeding galaxies and their gaseous haloes
Time:        6/14 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
Galaxies grow by accreting gas, which they need in order to form stars, from their surrounding haloes. These haloes, in turn, accrete gas from the intergalactic medium. Feedback from stars and black holes returns gas from the galaxy to the halo and can even expel it from the halo. Using cosmological simulations, I will describe this cycle of inflow and outflow, how it varies with redshift and halo mass, and its implications for star formation. I will then discuss the emission and absorption properties of the halo gas and show how to connect them to existing and future observations.
