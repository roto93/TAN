Dear Sebastien,

  I was wondering whether you might be able to circulate the following
announcement about AAO Student Fellowships to appropriate undergraduates
or mailing lists please?

Many thanks,
Andrew Hopkins
------------------------------**------------------------------**----------
Applications for the Jun-Sep 2013 AAO Student Fellowships are now open.
The deadline for applications is 15 Feb 2013.

aaosf.html>

Opportunities exist for undergraduate students who have completed not
less than 2 years of full time course work in Astronomy, Astrophysics,
Applied Physics, Engineering, Mathematics or related subjects to work
at the Australian Astronomical Observatory on research projects under
the individual supervision of AAO staff astronomers. In addition to
astronomical research, a major part of the Observatory's core business
is astronomical instrumentation for optical/infrared telescopes, and
studentships are available in this area as well.

Student Fellowships are available for 10 to 12 weeks in the period
mid-June to mid-September. The stipend is A$700 per week.

The AAO headquarters is located in North Ryde, a suburb approximately
16 km from the centre of Sydney. A field trip is arranged to
visit the telescopes at Siding Spring Observatory.

Applications should be directed to A. Prof. Andrew Hopkins,
Head of AAT Science. For further details, including how to apply, see:
