Topic:        Energy Deposition, Entropy and AGN Feedback in Galaxy Clusters
Time:        2/22 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
There are mounting evidences for AGN feedback in groups and clusters of galaxies. Understanding feedback in clusters is crucial for cluster cosmology apart from understanding the cluster thermal history. I will report the results of our study of fractional entropy enhancement in the intra-cluster medium (ICM) of the clusters from the representative XMM-Newton cluster structure survey (REXCESS). We use the `thermodynamic' entropy enhancement to make the first estimate of the total, as well as radial, non-gravitational energy deposition up to r500 for a large, nearly flux-limited, sample of clusters. We find that the total energy deposition is proportional to the cluster temperature (and hence mass), and that the centrally peaked energy deposition per particle as a function of gas mass shows a similar profile in all clusters. In the cluster core the energy deposition is also correlated with the radio luminosity. We also show that the recently proposed 'Universal' nature of clu!
ster pressure profiles points towards 'Universal' prescription of entropy injection which is indicative of AGN heating. Taken together, the results strongly support models of entropy enhancement through AGN feedback.
