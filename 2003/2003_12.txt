                                Abstract

Recent observations by the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) have found
evidence of rapid synthesis of complex organic molecules in the late
stages of stellar evolution. The chemical synthesis begins with the
formation of acetylene, the first building block of benzene, in carbon
stars. In a following proto-planetary nebulae stage, emission features
corresponding to stretching and bending modes of aliphatic compounds
are detected. When these objects evolve to become planetary nebulae,
aromatic C-H and C-C stretching and bending modes become strong. These
results show that complex carbonaceous compounds can be produced in a
circumstellar environment over a period of only a few thousand years.

In this talk, we will summarize the history of astronomical infrared
spectroscopy in the last 30 years, discuss the formation of solid-state
inorganic and organic compounds in stars, and speculate on the possible
implications of these products on the formation of the solar system.
