                 First Announcement and Call for Applications
------------------------------------------------------------------------

With this e-mail we would like to draw your attention on the

                   THIRD HELMHOLTZ-INSTITUTE SUMMER-SCHOOL on
                   "CHAOS AND STABILITY IN PLANETARY SYSTEMS"
                        September 1 - September 26, 2003
                           University of Potsdam
                             Potsdam, Germany



Supercomputers and chaos theory have shaped our sense for the long-term dynamics 
of planetary systems. The summer school aims at a better understanding of the 
dynamical stability, the role of resonances and the appearance of chaos in the 
motion of solar system bodies but also in the recently discovered extrasolar 
planetary systems. 
Special lectures on supercomputing and also the work with  state-of-the-art 
codes are offered to study the dynamics of these systems in detail. One 
interesting new aspect are the stability studies of Earth-like planets in 
so-called habitable zones.

SCIENCE DIRECTOR: RUDOLF DVORAK (UNIVERSITY VIENNA)

LECTURERS:        JACK LISSAUER (AMES RESEARCH CENTER, NASA)
                  THOMAS QUINN (UNIVERSITY WASHINGTON)
                  JOACHIM STADEL (UNIVERSITY ZURICH)
                  SYLVIO FERRAZ-MELLO (UNIVERSITY SAO PAULO)     


Applications are invited from students, graduate students, post-docs and 
researchers working in scientific disciplines related to the content of the 
summer school.  Deadline for application is May 31 2003.

Grants are available to cover accommodation, travel and living expenses.
Numbers will be limited and those interested are advised to make an early
application.
