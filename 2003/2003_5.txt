Title :   Constraint on particle physics from helioseismology

Speaker:  Prof. Hiromoto Shibahashi 
          (University of Tokyo, Japan)

Date:     3 January 2003 (Friday)

Time:    12:10
Place:   Room 620,  Physics Building, NTHU

Abstract:
Helioseismology used to be used to see what is the cause of the solar 
neutrino problem. Recent progress in experiments of neutrino detection 
showed, however, that neutrino oscillation accounts for this long-lived 
issue. This fact does not mean at all that helioseismology is not useful for 
elementary particle physics. Rather, combination of helioseismology and 
recent experiments of neutrino detection enables to give stringent 
constraint on some aspects of fundamental particle physics. We discuss what 
we should do and what we can do in this situation for elementary particle 
physics from the helioseismological side. We will demonstrate some examples; 
---limits on the neutrino parameters, the axion parameter, and the 
pp-nuclear cross section.

Dear Colleagues,

We will change the speaker of CosPA Joint Groups Meeting on January 13.
The original lectures will postpone to January 15.
Sorry for the inconvenience.

Title:  SLAC E-165 Experiment: Fluorescence in Air from Showers.

Abstract:
Recent observations by HiRes/Fly's Eye and AGASA indicated an apperant
descrepancy in the spectra of ultra-high energy cosmic rays above 1E18 eV.
Because of the importance of the physics involved, both experiments are
 investigating possible systematic effects.  One such effect is the air
 fluorecsece efficiency assumed by HiRes.  In this talk we discuss an
 experiment to be carried out at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
 (SLAC) to measure precisely the spectral efficiency for fluorecsence
 excited by monoenergetic particles, as well as particles from showers
 in an air-equivalent target.
