                     First  Announcement

                 X-RAY AND RADIO CONNECTIONS

                     3 - 6 February 2004
                  Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA

Dear Colleagues,

We are very pleased to announce the "X-RAY AND RADIO CONNECTIONS"
workshop; a meeting focused on scientific areas where cross
fertilization between theory and observations in both X-Ray and Radio
wavebands provides a key to the underlying physical processes.

The meeting will be held in the sunny and historic town of Santa Fe,
New Mexico (USA) from Tuesday February 3, through Friday February 6,
2004. This date is well before the proposal deadlines of the major
X-Ray and Radio astronomical observing facilities.

This first announcement is aimed at informing all colleagues about the
meeting. We suggest pre-registering for the meeting by visiting the
workshop web site at http://www.aoc.nrao.edu/events/xraydio/

We would appreciate your sharing this announcement with all those whom
might be interested in attending. We apologize if you have received
this announcement more than once.


SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE

  "Almost by definition, high energy sources are non-thermal and emit
   throughout the electromagnetic and other spectra and spectrally
   chauvinist interpretations of their behavior are incomplete"
                                                   (Blandford 2003)

  Currently, the observers of high-energy phenomena are split between
  several communities that independently investigate objects in their
  own waveband. This meeting will provide an opportunity to review
  underlying physical models, compare x-ray and radio observations,
  start new collaborations and develop a list of areas where new
  observations and theoretical development could significantly advance
  our understanding in the next few years.

  The meeting will include reviews, contributed talks, and posters on
  the major scientific topics listed below. The organizers hope to
  emphasize both invited and contributed talks from younger members of
  the community. Anyone interested in participating is encouraged to
  pre-register at the meeting website.


SCIENTIFIC TOPICS

  Massive star cluster outflows
  Colliding stellar winds
  Supernova remnants
  Pulsar wind nebulae
  Dissipation of jets and lobes
  Cluster mergers

IMPORTANT DATES

    mid August 2003  First Announcement, pre-registration
late September 2003  Second Announcement, call for abstracts, registration
    1 December 2003  Hotel & payment deadline for registration
   10 December 2003  Abstracts due
     5 January 2004  Deadlines for late registration


MEETING VENUE

  The meeting will be held in the Hilton Hotel in Santa Fe, New
  Mexico, USA. The Hilton Santa Fe is conveniently located near the
  historic plaza, where Native American, Hispanic and Anglo American
  cultures meet and lots of eateries, art and tourist shops are
  present. Furthermore, the state capitol is also a good starting
  point for numerous indoor and outdoor activities; in February mostly
  skiing. Santa Fe is highly ranked in the top tourist attractions in
  Northern America and fortunately the hotel has agreed to provide
  rooms three days before and three days after the meeting for the
  same rate. Santa Fe has only a small airport, so most travelers will
  arrive in Albuquerque and take a shuttle or rental car to Santa Fe.
