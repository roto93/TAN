Subject: University of Hawaii, Postdoctoral Position in Reaction Dynamics
 in Astrobiology


A postdoctoral position in experimental physical chemistry (reaction 
dynamics and kinetics at low temperature) is open at the University 
of Hawaii's NASA Astrobiology Institute (http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/UHNAI).
Successful applicants should have significant background in experimental
reaction dynamics, neutral and charged particle beams, laser systems, and
ultra high vacuum technology. Knowledge in C/C++ and Autocad is an 
advantage. The prime directive of the experimental research program is to
investigate how astrobiologically important molecules and water are formed
in the interstellar medium and in our solar system (comets, icy planets and
their satellites). Recent examples of our work are published in, for 
example, Chemical Reviews (102, 1309-1358,2002) and Int. Rev. Physical 
Chemistry (21, 307-356, 2002). To apply, please follow the instructions at
http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/UHNAI/application.html. Applications will be
reviewed beginning Dec. 15, 2003, but the positions will remain open until
filled.
