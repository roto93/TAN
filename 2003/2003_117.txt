            Title :  X-Ray Optics for Astronomy 
                              and the Telescopes for Astro-E2


            Abstarct:

            The advance in soft x-ray optics helps to make significant
            progress in astronomy in the past decades. In this talk, we
            will review the basic concept behind reflective x-ray optics
            in the astronomical context. We will also discuss some of the
            different approaches to these x-ray telescopes. In particular,
            I will illustrate, with the x-ray telescopes on board Astro-E
            and for the mission Astro-E2, the properties of these thin-foil
            segmented x-ray optics. Development in achieving higher 
            throughput, response in harder x-ray, and better angular 
            resolution will be address. I will end with some thoughts on 
            the future x-ray imaging missions.
