CALL FOR OBSERVING PROPOSALS

The Lulin One-meter Telescope (LOT) calls for observing time 
requests in the 2004A period which runs from January 1 to 
June 30.  Note that this is different from what has been 
operational in 2003 for which proposals were accepted on 
3-month basis.  In addition to the PI 1300B camera, a new 
CCD camera Apogee U42 is expected to be online for the 
new seasons.  Also a new set of Bessel BVRI filters and a 
high-quality H-alpha filter --- all with their transmission 
curves scanned already in the lab --- will be available.  

The observing request form can be downloaded from the NCU/IA 
homepage (http://www.astro.ncu.edu.tw).  The deadline is 
December 15.
