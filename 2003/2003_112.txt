Dear colleague,

at its meeting in Sydney on July 25, 2003, the Executive Committee
of International Astronomical Union accepted the proposal for an
IAU Symposium on  "The A-Star Puzzle" to be held on July 8-13, 2004,
in Poprad, Slovakia.

The Symposium will discuss the physical processes operating in the
central HR diagram stars. The theoretical progress will be compared
with the observational evidence provided by the A-type stars and by
their hotter and cooler neighbors. Observations of much higher quality
provided by new instruments at the modern large telescopes and their
impact on theoretical studies will be discussed too.

The initial information on the IAU Symposium No. 224 "The A-Star
Puzzle" can be obtained at the address

http://www.ta3.sk/iau224/

We should highly appreciate your circulating this announcement in
your Institute or University Department.


Thanking you in advance, yours very truly

Juraj Zverko & Werner W. Weiss
Co-chairpersons of the SOC
IAU Symposium No. 224
