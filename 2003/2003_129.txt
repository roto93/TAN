Dear colleagues:

As you know, ASIAA has agreement with CFHT to acquire 68 nights of
observing time between 2003-2007 under the CosPa project.  I would like to
invite proposals to use our share of the time in the 2004A semester.

All CFHT instruments are available for use, including
Megacam, MOS-OSIS, Gecko, AOB (wirh KIR or GriF), and CFHTIR. For details
on these instruments, please see

http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/ObsInfo/ObservingProposals/

Please note that some of these instruments may be decommissioned in future
semesters, so it could the last chance to use these instruments this
semester.

In addition to the broadband filters, filters for the 12k camera are also
available for megacam with a reduced field of view.  These filters are
listed in
http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/Instruments/Filters/cfh12k.html.

Please submit proposals to me by email, including sections on target list,
instrument and seeing requirements, scientific justification, technical
justification, references, and (not required) supporting figures, related
publications, and other telescope allocations.  Deadline for submission is
October 1.
