Subject: Alex Fridman

Dear Colleagues:

I am pleased to announce that Dr. Alexei (Alex) Fridman, a Russian
Academician and the leading Russian dynamist in astrophysics, will visit
us for two weeks, 4-6 to 4-19. Dr. Fridman has worked in many different
areas in astrophysics and earth science. He will give a series of
lectures on astrophysics problems in our institute, including one
invited talk at CAST, and two lectures in Institute of Earth Science.
He will also visit Tsinghua and Central  and give lectures.

Dr. Fridman was the thesis advisor of Dr. Uri Griv, who was with our
institute during the early days. He himself was a student of R.Z.
Sagdeev, a famous Russian plasma physicist.  He is related to A.
Friedmann, who corrected Einstein's error and found the expanding and
contracting universe solutions from Einstein's general relativity. Among
many achievements in science, Dr. Fridman is also well known as a
martial art fighter. If you visit his home, he will show you all the
knives he captured from the muggers. He is a character and fun to talk
to, scientific and non-scientific. I urge you to meet him and talk to
him while he is here. He will be sitting in RM 729. Dr. Fridman is
accompanied by his wife, Tanya.

Dr. Fridman's schedule is attached in this e-mail. Along with it are the
titles of his talks and brief abstracts. I send both latex file and ps
file for your convenience.

I hope you take good advantage of having Dr. Fridman around.

With best regards,

Chi Yuan

{\large Proposed Lectures}
\end{center}

\noindent 1. New Structures in Galactic Disks: Predictions and
Discoveries. (It is his review, $>$300 pages, which will appear in
Space Science Review in the end of March or in the beginning of
April).

\noindent
2. Physics of Planetary Rings. (The interest to
the planetary rings increases from day to day as
the Cassini spacecraft is approaching to Saturn.
It will encounter Saturn on 1 July 2004).

\noindent
3. The Galactic Center Dynamics (The innermost
central part of the Galaxy has very complicated
morphology and kinematics. There are many attempts
to understand the nature and origin of a puzzling
structure (so-called "mini-spiral") in the innermost
central part of the Galaxy located inside 1.5 pc.
We show that the "mini-spiral" origin can be caused
by an overreflection instability).

\noindent
4. Collective phenomena and turbulent viscosity
in accretion disks. (The other kind overreflection
instability - in comparison with that developing
in the Galactic Center - leads to an one-armed
spiral - vortex structure and observed turbulent
viscosity in accretion disks. The period of the
density wave rotation is in agreement with the
typical periods of light curve variations observed
in cataclysmic binary stars).

\noindent
5. On the discovery of two components - global
and mirror - of the Earth's seismic activity.

\noindent
6. Observational manifestations of wave phenomena
in the Central Tien Shan.

Both lectures (5,6) are devoted to the study of
the reasons of earthquakes. Key questions:\\
    1) correlations of the global seismic
    activity with peculiarities of Earth's
    rotation;\\
    2) from the measurement of the 3D velocity
    field of the Central Tien Shan by the GPS
    technique to the calculation of the strain
    field.\\
Dr. Fridman is currently  a superviser of one of the world's best
geophysical polygon in the Central Tien Shan,
where every summer scientists work from
different countries(2 professors from MIT,
a few - from Max-Planck-Institutes, etc).
