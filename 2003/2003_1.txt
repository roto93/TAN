Dear Sun, 

  We do not have spectroscopic information about the object.  It measures 
1-2 km across, with a=2.5 AU, hence a nominal main-belt asteroid.  At
discovery, it had R~20.6 , almost at the limit of our 1 m.  

  Cheers, 

  Wen Ping

1) GENERALITIES
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Center for Academic Excellence on "Cosmology and Particle Astro-
physics" of the National Taiwan University (Taida CosPA Center) will 
organize a symposium, the 2003 International Symposium on Cosmology 
and Particle Astrophysics (CosPA2003), from May 8 to May 10, 2003 
in Taipei, Taiwan. The first Symposium (CosPA 2002) was held from 
May 30 to June 2, 2002 in Taipei, Taiwan. 
        
The goal of the CosPA2003 Symposium is intended to bring together 
scientists to engage serious discussions on the following topics, 
among others: 
 
   (1) CMB Physics 
 
   (2) Dark Matter and Dark Energy 
 
   (3) Cosmology of Neutrinos and Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays 
 
   (4) Inflation and New Physics
 
It is hoped that the symposium will serve as the forum for relevant
researchers to exchange ideas or thoughts on the forefronts of the 
observational and theoretical cosmology and particle astrophysics. 
There will be invited review lectures, invited talks, and contributed 
talks. 
 
This symposium is co-sponsored by the Ministry of Education, the 
National Science Council, and the National Taiwan University.

Taipei, the capital of Republic of China, is located at north of 
Taiwan. National Taiwan University, located at southwest of Taipei
City, is surrounded by various shops, eateries, and theaters. The
subway system with a station just outside the campus builds the 
convenient connections to main features of the city and to the 
scenic area along the north shore of Taiwan. 
 
Weather of north Taiwan in early May is a little warm, 
with temperatures 22-30 C. Rain is usual, 50% chance of raining and 
80% of relative humidity. 
 
Electric outlet in Taiwan is 110 V double straight poles.

           Speaker:  Prof. Friedrich W. Hehl
       University of Cologne, Germany and
       University of Missouri-Columbia, USA

    Title : The Black Hole in the Center of our
               Milky Way

 Abstract:

A black hole is an object which is so closely packed that no particle
nor any light can be emitted from the black hole. Matter or light
which falls in can never get out again, provided quantum effects can
be neglected. --- We first discuss the notion of a black hole and then
turn our attention to the object Sagittarius A* in the center of our
Milky Way which has about 2 million solar masses. We describe how its =
mass
is determined by using the infrared visible Kepler orbits of
stars circling around Sgr A* (see the figure) and then collect the
evidence which shows that Sgr A* has to be a black hole.
