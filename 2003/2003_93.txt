                    Multiwavelength AGN Surveys
                  ---------------------------


            a "Guillermo Haro" Astrophysics Conference
          
                        organized by the

                Instituto Nacional de Astrofisica,
                   Optica y Electronica
                            (INAOE)


                       December 8-12, 2003 
                        
                         Cozumel, Mexico
                         ---------------


INAOE is pleased to announce this conference within the framework 
of the "Guillermo Haro Advanced Research Program".

The huge amount of data obtained by surveys in all wavebands, from 
radio to X-rays, has allowed a major progress in the understanding 
of Active Galactic Nuclei and of their cosmic evolution.

This conference is intended to give a broad overview of the recent
results obtained by AGN surveys over the whole electromagnetic
spectrum. Topics which will be discussed during the conference are:
AGN evolution, contribution to the cosmic background, AGN luminosity
functions in different wavebands, multiwavelength properties of AGN,
unified model and unconventional AGN, connection with the host
galaxies, co-evolution of AGN and galaxies, implications for the
local density of supermassive black holes. Future AGN surveys planned 
with forthcoming new observational facilities will also be discussed.
The conference will be held in Cozumel, one of the most beautiful
islands of the Caribbean. We encourage you to pre-register by 
submitting the form attached below. 


This and additional information (including a preliminary program) 
will be available at the conference website:
