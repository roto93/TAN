Dear TANists,

An interview with the president of National Tsing-Hua University,
Prof. Frank Shu, who is also known to many of us as the founding
father of Taiwan's astronomy, is now available for your preview at:
        http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/TAN/

This interview was conducted in late summer this year and is 
scheduled to appear in this month's Physics Bimonthly (December 2003
issue, to be published later this month). The article is in Chinese
and can be viewed (PDF file) from most machines using Acroread 4.0
(or later) with or without chinese fonts installed.  MicroSoft Word
(.doc) file is also available.

Special thanks to Physics Bimonthly for kindly granting us the 
permission to make the article available to the astronomy community
prior to its publication.

Regards,
Yi-Jehng

CALL FOR OBSERVING PROPOSALS

The Lulin One-meter Telescope (LOT) calls for observing time 
requests in the 2004A period which runs from January 1 to 
June 30.  Note that this is different from what has been 
operational in 2003 for which proposals were accepted on 
3-month basis.  In addition to the PI 1300B camera, a new 
CCD camera Apogee U42 is expected to be online for the 
new seasons.  Also a new set of Bessel BVRI filters and a 
high-quality H-alpha filter --- all with their transmission 
curves scanned already in the lab --- will be available.  

The observing request form can be downloaded from the NCU/IA 
homepage (http://www.astro.ncu.edu.tw).  The deadline is 
December 15.
