Dear Colleagues and Friends,

     Due to the unexpected outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome (SARS), we have decided to postpone the 2003 International Symposium 
on Cosmology and Particle Astrophysics, which was originally scheduled
on May 8-10, 2003 at Taida, to November 14-16, 2003. We shall provide more 
details of the conference shortly. 

     Once again, we sincerely apologize for this sudden change, and look
forward to your attendance in November. 

                                 Sincerely,

In addition, we are also pleased to have four invited talks given by
Dr. Norio Kaifu (NAOJ), Dr. Paul Ho (ASIAA), Dr. Masato Ishiguro (NAOJ),
and Dr. Alex Fridman (Russian Academy). The program and abstracts
can be found at the symposium web page
