Dear colleague,

As I'm sure you know, the next General Assembly of the International 
Astronomical Union (IAU) is to be held in Sydney, Australia, during 
13-26 July this year.

I'd like to remind you that initial abstracts for any oral or poster 
presentation must be submitted online by 1 March. (See 
www.astronomy2003.com under "Call for Papers".) If you are thinking of 
submitting an abstract but can't do so by the due date, please contact 
the organisers of the relevant meeting.

Please forward this mail to anyone you think may be interested in 
attending the General Assembly.

Regards,



Helen Sim
CSIRO Australia Telescope National Facility
National Organising Committee, 25th IAU General Assembly
