     Postdoctoral Position in Reaction Dynamics in Astrobiology
    boundary="------------030707080606040307080106"


 A postdoctoral position in experimental physical chemistry (reaction dynamics and kinetics at low temperature)
is open at the University of Hawaii's NASA Astrobiology Institute (http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/UHNAI). Successful
applicants should have significant background in experimental reaction dynamics, neutral and charged particle 
beams, laser systems, and ultra high vacuum technology. Knowledge in C/C++ and Autocad is an advantage. The prime
directive of the experimental research program is to investigate how astrobiologically important molecules and 
water are formed in the interstellar medium and in our solar system (comets, icy planets and their satellites). 
Recent examples of our work are published in, for example, Chemical Reviews (102, 1309-1358,2002) and Int. Rev. 
Physical Chemistry (21, 307-356, 2002). To apply, please follow the instructions at
http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/UHNAI/application.html. Applications will be reviewed beginning Dec. 15, 2003, 
but the positions will remain open until filled.
