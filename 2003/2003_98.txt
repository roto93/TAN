To Pauchy and others, 

  The responsibility for the delayed announcement is solely on me.  I
submitted it to TAN too late.  The deadline for time requests for each
season, as has been practiced for the last 6 months, is the 15th date
prior to the beginning of a season.  So for July to September, the
deadline would be June 15.  I circulated an email message to past and
potential users a few days earlier and only later did it occur to me that
I should put it through TAN also.  Sorry about this.  

  Regards, 

  Wen Ping
