Subject: Re: TAN (Issue May 31 - June 16, 2003)

I was surprised to see that the deadline of this news item, 15 June 2003,
already passed when TAN issued the "news". I also wondered why NCU could
give only 4 or 5 days on such important issues regarding calling for the
observing proposals - I would hope that such matters could be handled in a
serious manner.             Best wishes to all TAN'ers, W-Y. Pauchy Hwang
