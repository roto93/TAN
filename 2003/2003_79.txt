 OBSERVATIONAL, THEORETICAL, AND INSTRUMENTATION SCIENTISTS
               INSTITUTE OF ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS (ASIAA)
                       Academia Sinica, Taiwan


The ASIAA (http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw), located in the campus of Nation=
al Taiwan University in Taipei, is an institute of the Academia Sinica, the=
 national research organization in Taiwan.  The ASIAA is an internationally=
 oriented institute where English is the working language.  There is ample =
support for research as well as international travel to observatories and c=
onferences, and an active visitor's program.

Present research at the ASIAA includes the Solar System, Stellar Atmosphere=
s and Mass Outflows, Star Formation, Galactic Dynamics, Starburst and Activ=
e Galaxies (including QSOs), Dark Matter, and Cosmology.  Our main telescop=
e projects include the SubMillimeter Array (SMA) on Mauna Kea, the Taiwan-A=
merican Occultation Survey (TAOS) for small Kuiper Belt objects, the Array =
for Microwave Background Anisotropy (AMiBA) to study CMB polarization and s=
earch for distant galaxy clusters using the the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect, a=
nd a Wide-Field Infrared Camera (WIRCam) for the Canadian-France-Hawaii-Tel=
escope (CFHT) in exchange for guaranteed observing time.  Our main theoreti=
cal project is a CFD-MHD initiative.  All of these projects are made in clo=
se collaboration with leading research organizations worldwide.

We seek scientists to augment both the Institute's research and engineering=
 efforts, in particular: 1) outstanding scientists to pursue independent re=
search in any area of astronomy and astrophysics; 2) astronomers with exper=
ience at millimeter/sub-millimeter wavelengths and/or radio interferometry =
to participate in ongoing tests/software development and scientific observa=
tions with the SMA (http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/Research/SMART/); 3) obs=
ervational and theoretical cosmologists interested in CMB anisotropy/polari=
zation and the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect to participate in the construction =
and scientific observations with AMiBA (http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/amib=
a/); 4) optical astronomers to participate in a search for Kuiper Belt Obje=
cts with TAOS
(http://taos.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw) or distant galaxy clusters with the CFHT =
partly in support of AMiBA; 5) scientists with physics, electrical engineer=
ing, or astronomy backgrounds to participate in the development of novel re=
ceivers and detectors (e.g., SIS junctions, HEB mixers, MMIC devices, and s=
uperconducting bolometers) for millimeter/sub-millimeter receivers on the S=
MA and AMiBA, or infrared detector array and system integration for WIRCam
(http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/News/Projects/WIRCam/New/) on the CFHT; and 6) =
scientists with backgrounds in astronomy, astrophysics, physics, and planet=
ary sciences to pursue topics in theoretical astrophysics
(http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/theory/) computational fluid dynamics, and =
magnetohydrodynamics under the CFD-MHD initiative (http://www.asiaa.sinica.=
edu.tw/~mhd/).

Applicants should submit a curriculum vitae, a brief summary of research an=
d future research plans or instrumentation experience, and arrange three le=
tters of recommendation to: Dr. P. Ho, PO Box 23-141, Taipei 106, Taiwan; F=
ax: 886-2-2367 7849; Email: asiaa@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw.  The closing date fo=
r applications is 30 June 2003.
