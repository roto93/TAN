Subject: graduate program Reaction Dynamics, Laboratory Astrophysics,
     and Planetary Sciences, Univeristy of Hawaii

Starting in August 2003, the Department of Chemistry and the Department 
of Physics & Astronomy at The University of Hawai'i at Manoa open the 
new interdisciplinary graduate program 'Reaction Dynamics, Laboratory 
Astrophysics, and Planetary Sciences' leading to a Ph.D. degree in 
chemistry and physics, respectively. The prime directive of this 
endeavor is to unravel the underlying mechanisms on how complex, 
(astrobiologically) important molecules and nanostructures are 
synthesized from the bottom up via single atoms, radicals, and small 
molecules in the interstellar medium, in atmospheres of planets and 
their satellites, cometary comae, as well as in combustion flames and 
chemical vapor deposition processes 
(http://www.chem.hawaii.edu/Bil301/program.htm).

In collaboration with research groups from the Hawaiian Institute of 
Geophysics and Planetology (HIGP), the Institute for Astronomy (IfA), 
and The Open University (UK), cutting edge laboratory experiments, 
electronic structure calculations, and astronomical observations will be 
linked to lecture courses outlining fundamental principles in physical 
chemistry, physics, reaction dynamics, astrochemistry, astrobiology, 
planetary chemistry, combustion sciences, and nanomaterial research. 
Interested candidates should send a letter of interest, three letters of 
recommendation, transcripts or equivalent documentation, and a 
curriculum vitae to Prof. Ralf I. Kaiser, Department of Chemistry, 
University of Hawai'i at Manoa, 2545 The Mall, Honolulu, HI 96822, USA 
(email: kaiser@gold.chem.hawaii.edu) or to Prof. Klaus Sattler, 
Department of Physics, University of Hawai'i, Honolulu, HI 96822, USA 
(email: sattler@hawaii.edu). Exceptionally well qualified candidates are 
offered teaching assistantships and full tuition fee waivers.
