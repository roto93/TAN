Call for Observing Proposals --- Lulin 1 m telescope

Please be reminded that the deadline for time requests on the LOT for the 
July to September season is 15 June, 2003.  To be online serving as the 
facility instrument is the Princeton Instrument 1300 B camera that is 
capable of reading out at 1 MHz, making it suitable for time-series 
imaging photometry.  The dual wheel unit can house up to 12 filters.  
Currently broadband and narrowband filters are available, and there are 
empty slots to accommodate user-supply filters (2" squared or round).   

You are encouraged to contact the NCU staff or <hclin@astro,ncu.edu.tw> 
for inquiries on the telescope, the camera, or the accommodation/transportation 
of the site.  For an observing time request form, check out

and change the season to 2003-III.
