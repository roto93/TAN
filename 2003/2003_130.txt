TITLE: Earthshine Observing Network

SPEAKER: Prof Dean-Yi Chou (Physics Department and Institute of Astronomy,
                            Tsing Hua University)
         
ABSTRACT
========
Earthshine is sunlight reflected by the Earth visible as 
a dim image of dark portion of the Moon's disk.  
The earthshine intensity relates to the Earth's albedo,
which relates to the Earth's effective temperature.  
Temporal variations of the earthshine intensity provide information 
on the variations of the Earth's albedo and global effective temperature. 
We will build a global ground-based network of automated
telescopes to measure the earthshine intensity
to study the short-term and long-term variations of the Earth's albedo.

Dear Yi Jehng:

Please post this message on TAN.

Thanks,

Dear colleagues:

As you know, ASIAA has agreement with CFHT to acquire 68 nights of
observing time between 2003-2007 under the CosPa project.  I would like to
invite proposals to use our share of the time in the 2004A semester.

All CFHT instruments are available for use, including
Megacam, MOS-OSIS, Gecko, AOB (wirh KIR or GriF), and CFHTIR. For details
on these instruments, please see

http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/ObsInfo/ObservingProposals/

Please note that some of these instruments may be decommissioned in future
semesters, so it could the last chance to use these instruments this
semester.

In addition to the broadband filters, filters for the 12k camera are also
available for megacam with a reduced field of view.  These filters are
listed in
http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/Instruments/Filters/cfh12k.html.

Please submit proposals to me by email, including sections on target list,
instrument and seeing requirements, scientific justification, technical
justification, references, and (not required) supporting figures, related
publications, and other telescope allocations.  Deadline for submission is
October 1.
