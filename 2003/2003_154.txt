The Ninth Summer School in Synthesis Imaging will take place from June
15 (Tuesday) through June 22 (Tuesday) of 2004.  The Summer School will
be hosted by the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) and by the
New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, and will be held in the
Workman center on the Tech campus in Socorro, New Mexico.  The Summer
School will cover the fundamentals of radio interferometry, including
both connected element and very long baseline interferometers, and some
advanced lectures on specialized topics.  Data reduction tutorials at
the Array Operations Center of the NRAO will give attendees "hands-on"
experience with data calibration and imaging for both VLA and VLBA data.
The range of subjects will be similar to past Summer Schools, and can
be reviewed by consulting "Synthesis Imaging in Radio Astronomy II",
the published collection of lectures from the 6th NRAO Synthesis
Imaging Summer School (ASP Conference Series, Volume 180, 1999).
The lectures will be given at a level appropriate for graduate students
in astrophysics.  There will be ample time for questions and discussion
following each lecture and at the end of each day.

Attendance at the Summer School will be limited to a total of 150 people.
There will be a registration fee of $120, which includes a copy of
"Synthesis Imaging in Radio Astronomy II", transportation to and from
Albuquerque airport on June 14 and on June 22/23, daily transportation
to/from local hotels, a tour of the VLA, and several other events.  The
possibility of providing some financial assistance is being investigated,
and further details will be described in the second announcement.  Rooms
will be blocked out at Socorro motels for the school, and information on
these motels will be sent to registered participants in February 2004.
The daily cost of a single room currently ranges from $56-$73 and sharing
a double from $28-$39 per person including tax.  Motel reservations will
be the responsibility of the attendees.

To indicate your interest in attending the Summer School and to receive
future mailings, please pre-register electronically by following the
directions at http://www.aoc.nrao.edu/events/synthesis/2004/.

Subject: [Colloquium] ASIAA Colloquium This Friday

 Dear all,
 
 	This is to remind you that we will have a colloquium this
  Friday afternoon. Satoki will discuss his latest findings about
  the molecular superbubbles in the starburst galaxy M82.

  Please mark your calendar and note that the talk will be held
  in Room 833.
 
  regards,
 
  sheng-yuan
 
 --------------------------- ASIAA Colloquium ---------------------------
 Speaker : Satoki Matsushita (ASIAA)
 Title   : Starburst at the Molecular Superbubble in M82
 Time    : Friday 10/24 2:00 pm
 Location: ASIAA Room 716
 URL     : http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/act/colloquium.php
 
 Abstract: M82 is one of the nearest starburst galaxies, and
           therefore well suited for a case study about starburst.
           We present high spatial resolution (2.3" x 1.9" or
           36pc x 30pc) 100GHz continuum emission observations
           with the Nobeyama Millimeter Array toward an expanding 
           molecular superbubble in the central region of M82.
           The 100GHz continuum image, which is dominated by
           free-free emission, revealed that the strongest peaks
           are concentrated at the inner edge of the superbubble 
           along the galactic disk. The production rates of Lyman
           continuum photons calculated from the 100GHz continuum
           flux are an order of magnitude higher than those from
           the most massive star forming regions in our Galaxy.
           Based on our data and previously published data,
           self-propagating starburst around this region is also
           discussed.
