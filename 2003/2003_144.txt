            Title :  Suprime-Cam (Subaru Prime Focus Cemera) and Its 
                     Application to TNO Searches

            Abstract:

            I briefly summarize the characteristics of 8.2-m Subaru 
            Telescope and its prime focus camera "Suprime-Cam". This 
            system is the only instrument currently available that can 
            achieve both deep imaging capability (R = 28 mag) and 
            wide-field imaging (30 arcmin). Suprime-Cam is the most 
            powerful tool for conducting surveys for high-z galaxies, weak 
            lensing, supernovae, and also minor bodies in solar system. I 
            will describe scientific interests of TNO (Trans-Neptunian 
            Object) search, and report recent results from our searches. I 
            also describe how to apply for the telescope time of Subaru, 
            the procedure of open-use observation, and the outline of data
            reduction. I also show the summary of Hyper-SuprimeCam 
            project, the upgrade plan for Suprime-Cam.
