              Speaker :  Sekiguchi Tomohiko

              Title :  Progress Report on Atacama Submillimeter Telescope 
                       Experiment (ASTE) and Applications to Thermal 
                       Observations of TNOs and Extra-Solar Kuiper Belt

              Abstract:

              The Atacama Submillimeter Telescope Experiment (ASTE) is the 
              Japanese project of a 10-meter submillimeter antenna in the 
              Atacama desert of northern Chile. It was built in March, 
              2002 in Pampa la Bola, at 4840m altitude. The location is 
              very close to Chajnantor area, known as the ALMA site. The 
              project is managed by National Astronomical Observatory
              of Japan (NAOJ) in collaboration with Japanese universities 
              and Universidad de Chile. The high precision submillimeter 
              antenna and high performance submillimeter receivers are 
              built, then installed for developments of engineering and 
              observational techniques in the submillimeter wavelengths. 
              The telescope is operated on-site and from the nearest 
              village of San Pedro de Atacama (2850m) currently and,
              from Universidad de Chile and from NAOJ in Japan in the near 
              future.

              We here, report on the current status of the project and the
              development of the 3 colours bolometer. The effective 
              observable wavelengths of the bolometer are in the 
              atmospheric windows of 850, 450 and 350 micron bands (350, 
              650 and 850 GHz). The continuum observations in the high 
              frequency bands (submillimeter wavelength) allows us to 
              observe thermal emissions from cold objects and dusts
              such as TNOs and debris disks. We discuss on the observation 
              plans to derive the size and effective temperature of TNOs, 
              and to estimate of dust mass in extra Kuiper disks using 
              ASTE and ALMA in the future. This study aims to obtain the 
              size distribution of TNOs for our solar system, and the 
              fraction of existence of debris disks for solar analogue 
              stars, and the disk kinematics, disk mass, gas-to-dust
              ratio of the disk and mass of the central star for the 
              near-by young star region. Such physical quantities allow us 
              to verify the standard theory of planetary system formation.

Dear Colleagues:

     I am sending you the scientific program of the 2003 CosPA
International Symposium on November 13-15, 2003 - just a few days away.

     In this message, you should be able to identify names, titles, and
the time slots, and even more. Please feel free to disseminate this
information to postdocs and students, especially those who might be
interested. It is not too late to register by visiting the website
www.cospa.ntu.edu.tw or call Vicky Chen at 02-3366 5187.

     Please note that the symposium concert and the post-conference tour
are also exciting events, as indicated at the end of the enclosed
message. I sincerely hope that entertainments and stimulations could help
you become more creative and original in your research life.

     I look forward to seeing you at the Conference.

                                     Best wishes, W-Y. Pauchy Hwang
