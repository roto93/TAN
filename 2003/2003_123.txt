            Title :  Probing the chemistry of cyanopolyyne molecules 
                     in the envelope of late-type stars


            Abstarct:

            Cyanopolyynes (HC$_{2n+1}$N) are among the most abundant 
            carbon chain molecules in the envelope of carbon-rich AGB 
            (asymptotic giant branch) and post-AGB stars. Study of the 
            cyanopolyynes can provide information on the chemical 
            processes and the structure of the circumstellar envelopes. I 
            will review the chemical mechanisms to synthesize the 
            cyanopolyyne molecules and present the initial results of 
            our observation program to determine the distribution of these 
            molecules in AGB and post-AGB stars. Implications to the 
            physical and chemical models of carbon rich circumstellar 
            envelopes are also discussed.
