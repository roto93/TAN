Dear Yi-Jehng, 

  Could you circulate this on TAN when you get a chance?  Thanks.

*** Dynamical and Chemical Evolution of Star Clusters ***

The workshop on Dynamical and Chemical Evolution of Star clusters will be held
Nov 24 to 28 at National Central University, Taiwan .  The Workshop derives 
from,  but not limited to, the ongoing Taiwan-Baltic collaboration on open
cluster studies.  So far some 20 talks have been scheduled, with topics 
ranging from using star clusters as probes to Galactic structure and 
evolution, to observational techniques of star clusters.    

Information about the Workshop and the scientific program can be found on the 
webpage

  http://140.115.34.77/TaiBalConf.htm

We have reserved a block of rooms at the university guest house for foreign 
participants. Domestic participants who also plan to stay on campus during
the Workshop should contact us for arrangements before Nov 15th.  The room
should be reasonably well accommodated, but you should bring in your own
hygienic kit.   

For foreign participants, please make sure we have your itineraries so we can 
arrange for your accommodation and airport pickup.  

Paper presentations have either 40 or 30 minute talks.  Nominal PC, overhead, 
and real-object projectors are available.  If you need an additional 
equipment please let us know in advance.  You are welcome to present 
posters.  Please contact us for arrangement.  

The weather at this time of the year is mild, usually in mid-20s to mid-10s.
A light jacket suffices.  If you plan to join the trip to Lulin Observatory,
which elevates to nearly 3000 m, the night-time temperature is close to 
freezing so warm clothing is required.  Scattered rain is always a 
possibility.  Taiwan's electrical system uses 110 V with A-type plug 
(shaped like '11').  You will have Internet connection at the conference 
venue.  No Internet service is currently available at the guest house.   

Inquiries should be sent to chinwei.chen@msa.hinet.net or call 886-3-4262302.

Look forward to seeing you soon. 

Chin-Wei Chen, on behalf of the LOC
