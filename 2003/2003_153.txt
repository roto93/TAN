Subject: [Colloquium] ASIAA Colloquium This Friday


 Dear all,
 
 	This is to remind you that we will have a colloquium this
  Friday afternoon. Satoki will discuss his latest findings about
  the molecular superbubbles in the starburst galaxy M82.

  Please mark your calendar and note that the talk will be held
  in Room 833.
 
  regards,
 
  sheng-yuan

 Speaker : Satoki Matsushita (ASIAA)
 Title   : Starburst at the Molecular Superbubble in M82
 Time    : Friday 10/24 2:00 pm
 Location: ASIAA Room 716

 Abstract: M82 is one of the nearest starburst galaxies, and
           therefore well suited for a case study about starburst.
           We present high spatial resolution (2.3" x 1.9" or
           36pc x 30pc) 100GHz continuum emission observations
           with the Nobeyama Millimeter Array toward an expanding 
           molecular superbubble in the central region of M82.
           The 100GHz continuum image, which is dominated by
           free-free emission, revealed that the strongest peaks
           are concentrated at the inner edge of the superbubble 
           along the galactic disk. The production rates of Lyman
           continuum photons calculated from the 100GHz continuum
           flux are an order of magnitude higher than those from
           the most massive star forming regions in our Galaxy.
           Based on our data and previously published data,
           self-propagating starburst around this region is also
           discussed.
