Subject: KITP conf. on Superstring Cosmology

Dear Colleague:

In conjunction with our ongoing KITP program on Superstring 
Cosmology, we are organizing a conference on this subject during the 
week of Oct. 20 to Oct. 24, 2003.  We expect a stimulating meeting 
which will explore all aspects of the intersection between 
string/M-theory and cosmology, including the nature of the Big Bang 
singularity, models of inflation based on string theory moduli and 
brane dynamics, the study of cosmologies which evolve from a Big 
Crunch to a Big Bang, cosmology and the holographic principle, the 
quantum theory of asymptotically De Sitter and chaotic universes, and 
possible imprints of string physics on observational cosmology.

For more information, and to register, go to

Tom Banks, Sean Carroll, Juan Maldacena, Joe Polchinski,
     and Gabriele Veneziano
