Hi Everyone,

As you all know, the MAP collaboration (now WMAP), has released its first
all sky map of the CMB anisotropy.  With this comes 13 papers discussing
the methods and results. I think it is a good idea to pay some attention
on them. Here is a web page where you can get high quality versions of the
papers.

Enjoy it and have a nice lantern festival!

Best regards,

Hwei-Jang Yo

Radio Astronomy at 70: from Karl Jansky to microjansky
                         JENAM-2003 Symposium
               Budapest, Hungary, 27-30 August 2003

                         First Announcement

It was 70 years ago, in 1933, when the synergy between scientific
discovery and technological advances enabled Karl Jansky to open a new
window on the Universe, thus marking the birth of radio astronomy.
Since then, radio astronomy has made huge progress, resulting in
the improvement of sensitivity over the last decades by many orders of
magnitude and approaching micro-arcsecond angular resolution. It has
become one of the major tools for studying the Universe. Radio galaxies
with their enormously energetic clouds of relativistic electrons and
cosmic jets that extend up to millions of light years into space,
quasars, pulsars, gravitational lensing, cosmic microwave masers, extra
solar planetary systems, complex interstellar molecules, and the cosmic
microwave background radiation were all discovered by radio
telescopes. Radio telescopes have also been used to measure the
relativistic bending of electromagnetic waves which pass near the limb
of the Sun, to establish the existence of gravitational radiation, to
measure continental drift, and most recently to measure the finite
speed of gravity waves. The progress of radio astronomy is driven by
the needs of fundamental science and is based on the state-of-the-art
developments in technology.

The Symposium will provide a stage for discussing various aspects of
modern radio astronomy. A series of invited reviews will cover the
following areas:

  - Low-brightness radio/microwave background and cosmology;
  - Extragalactic radio sources - lighthouses of the Universe;
  - The Galaxy: continuum and spectral line radio constituents;
  - Radio astronomical relativistic experiments (pulsar timing,
    astrometry);
  - History of radio astronomy

There will also be ample opportunity for contributed talks and poster
presentations. The focal point of the symposium will be a discussion on
the scientific and technological challenges of the next generation
radio astronomy facilities, such as the new  ALMA, LOFAR, the next
generation space-borne radio astronomy missions, SKA and VERA as well
as upgraded instruments (EVLA, eMERLIN, e-VLBI). It is expected that
as an event conducted under the auspices of the JENAM-2003 thus
coinciding in time and place with other astronomical symposia and
meetings, the present Symposium will give an opportunity to discuss
developments in radio astronomy amongst a broader professional
astronomical community and enable a multi-disciplinary discussion of
various subjects and perspectives of astronomical studies.
