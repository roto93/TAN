Title   : The Synthesis of Inorganic and Organic Compounds
          in the Late Stages of Stellar Evolution
Time    : Friday 1/17 4:00 pm
Location: ASIAA Room 716

                                Abstract

Recent observations by the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) have found
evidence of rapid synthesis of complex organic molecules in the late
stages of stellar evolution. The chemical synthesis begins with the
formation of acetylene, the first building block of benzene, in carbon
stars. In a following proto-planetary nebulae stage, emission features
corresponding to stretching and bending modes of aliphatic compounds
are detected. When these objects evolve to become planetary nebulae,
aromatic C-H and C-C stretching and bending modes become strong. These
results show that complex carbonaceous compounds can be produced in a
circumstellar environment over a period of only a few thousand years.

In this talk, we will summarize the history of astronomical infrared
spectroscopy in the last 30 years, discuss the formation of solid-state
inorganic and organic compounds in stars, and speculate on the possible
implications of these products on the formation of the solar system.

   Title: Instrumentation for cosmic ray experiments at CERN

   Time: Jan. 20 (Monday), 2003, 10:30 am

  Place: NCTS lecture Room, 2nd Floor, Computer Center Building, NCTU

  Abstract:
 Cosmic ray physics at very high energies has become a very active
 area in recent years. At the ``knee'' region of the cosmic ray energy
 spectrum, several experiments (surface detectors and underground
 experiments) are confronting their results on the composition of primary
 particles with energies around 10^{15}eV without a complete agreement
 among each other. With these datas in hand, many theorists are trying to
 explain some  aspects of these events, such as the galactic or
 extra-galactic origin of these events, obtaining huge uncertainties mainly
 due the inadequate knowledge about the characteristics of hadronic
 interactions above accelerator energies. The dedicated high energy
 experiments such as L3-LEP (and more recently ALICE) at CERN,
 using their high precision apparatus may start playing a crucial role
 in this direction. In this talk, I will  present some recent results about
 our work in three different cosmic ray experiments at CERN:
 CORAL (Cosmic ray experiment at LHC),
 ACORDE (A cosmic ray detector for ALICE) and a Two
 surface cosmic ray detector array correlated data, at CERN.
