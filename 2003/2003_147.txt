Dear all,

	This is to remind you that we will have a colloquium this
 Friday afternoon. Sebastien will talk about his research on the
 molecular gas in M31, the Andromeda galaxy. Please note there is
 a room change (to Room 833) and remember to attend.

 regards,

 sheng-yuan

Speaker : Sebastien Muller (ASIAA)
Title   : Molecular gas in the Andromeda Galaxy
Time    : Friday 10/17 2:00 pm
Location: NTU Physics Dept. Room 833

Abstract: Molecular gas in the Andromeda Galaxy --
          distribution, kinematics and properties of the molecular gas

	  Both IRAM 30m and Plateau de Bure Interferometer have been used
          to study the CO(1-0) line emission of the molecular gas in the
	  Andromeda galaxy (M31). The disk of the galaxy reveals thin
          molecular spiral arms decomposed in complexes and clouds. The 
          kinematics of the molecular gas show interesting double peaked 
          profiles, which are not due to a warp. I will finally present 
          somephysical properties of the molecular clouds, especially
          their masses, as derived through dynamical considerations (virial
          theorem).
