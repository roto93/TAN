Star and Telescope 8 Workshop on "National Observatory of Taiwan?"

  The 8th "Star and Telescope" workshop (ST8) will be held on March 21,
Friday, this time at NCU, to focus on if and how Taiwan should have a
national observatory.  The possibility may range from a managing
consortium of observing facilities, to an umbrella organization to cover
all branches of astrophysic studies, including observations and theory
groups for optimal overall planning and prioritized use of resources.  

  You are invited to participate in this activity, or better yet, to
contribute a talk or your viewpoints.  We hope to gather a program with
speakers briefing on how Americans, Mainland Chinese, Japanese and Korean
are doing as far as similar, national observatory infrastructure goes, and
if any effort or planning has been initiated for Taiwan.  Needless to say,
your active participation is very much encouraged.  If you can volunteer 
to speak, please let me know.  

  I will keep you all posted as the program gets finalized.  Meanwhile
please mark your calendar on March 21, Friday, at NCU.  The workshop
will start at 11 am and usually ends by 4:30 or so.
