Dear TANists,

An interview with the president of National Tsing-Hua University,
Prof. Frank Shu, who is also known to many of us as the founding
father of Taiwan's astronomy, is now available for your preview at:
        http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/TAN/

This interview was conducted in late summer this year and is 
scheduled to appear in this month's Physics Bimonthly (December 2003
issue, to be published later this month). The article is in Chinese
and can be viewed (PDF file) from most machines using Acroread 4.0
(or later) with or without chinese fonts installed.  MicroSoft Word
(.doc) file is also available.

Special thanks to Physics Bimonthly for kindly granting us the 
permission to make the article available to the astronomy community
prior to its publication.

Regards,
Yi-Jehng
