Dear Colleagues:

I am pleased to announce that Dr. Alexei (Alex) Fridman, a Russian
Academician and the leading Russian dynamist in astrophysics, will visit
us for two weeks, 4-6 to 4-19. Dr. Fridman has worked in many different
areas in astrophysics and earth science. He will give a series of
lectures on astrophysics problems in our institute, including one
invited talk at CAST, and two lectures in Institute of Earth Science.
He will also visit Tsinghua and Central  and give lectures.

Dr. Fridman was the thesis advisor of Dr. Uri Griv, who was with our
institute during the early days. He himself was a student of R.Z.
Sagdeev, a famous Russian plasma physicist.  He is related to A.
Friedmann, who corrected Einstein's error and found the expanding and
contracting universe solutions from Einstein's general relativity. Among
many achievements in science, Dr. Fridman is also well known as a
martial art fighter. If you visit his home, he will show you all the
knives he captured from the muggers. He is a character and fun to talk
to, scientific and non-scientific. I urge you to meet him and talk to
him while he is here. He will be sitting in RM 729. Dr. Fridman is
accompanied by his wife, Tanya.

Dr. Fridman's schedule is attached in this e-mail. Along with it are the
titles of his talks and brief abstracts. I send both latex file and ps
file for your convenience.

I hope you take good advantage of having Dr. Fridman around.

With best regards,

Chi Yuan
