Dear TANists,

TAN has been usually quiet so far this summer probably due to SARS.
Now we are SARS free so we deserve some happy news!

In the Science Times section of today's New York Times, there is a
magnificent picture of "celestial fireworks".  More details can be
found at   http://spaceflightnow.com/news/n0307/04fireworks/

By the way, this excellent work is led by Hubble astronomers 
Prof. You-Hua Chu (also a TAN subscriber!) from the University of
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

Happy summer!


YJK
