    2nd NAIC-NRAO School on Single-Dish Radio Astronomy
                   1st Announcement

The Green Bank (NRAO) and Arecibo (NAIC) observatories are organizing
the second NAIC-NRAO School on Single Dish Radio Astronomy. The summer
school will take place from 10-16 August 2003 at the Green Bank
Observatory in Green Bank, West Virginia. It is intended for students,
postdocs, and experts in other fields of astronomy who would like to
explore emerging techniques and applications of single-dish radio
astronomy.

The school will consist of an intensive series of lectures in
conjunction with hands on projects for participants. The primary goals are:

    * to provide participants with a strong grounding in fundamental
      elements of single-dish radio astronomy, and its relation to other
      observing techniques;
    * to give an overview of current and emerging capabilities of
      single-dish radio telescopes;
    * and to provide practical experience with a single-dish telescope,
      and familiarize participants with all phases of the observing and
      data reduction process.

Both lecturers and participants are invited to contribute posters
describing research conducted with single dishes. Proceedings of the
first Single Dish School in 2001 is published in the ASP Conference
Series (Vol. 278) and will be provided to this year's participants as
part of the registration fee.

The number of participants will be limited to approximately 55 people. A
registration fee of $150 will include: travel to/from Dulles airport,
the welcome reception, the social events, the school banquet, and a copy
of the proceedings.
