Dear all,

Prof. Chung-I Kuo, the speaker of the colloquium this week, just
informed me that he would like to slightly modify the title of his talk
to be "From Gravitational Mirage, Gravitational Rainbow to Critical
Opalescence, and Beyond".

Hope to see you on Friday


Yi Chou

Subject: postdoctoral position in reaction dynamics

Department of Chemistry, University of Hawai'i at Manoa

A postdoctoral position in experimental physical chemistry (reaction 
dynamics and combustion chemistry) is open at the Department of 
Chemistry, University of Hawai'i at Manoa, for the period of one year at 
a salary of $ 36,000, renewable upon mutual agreement. Successful 
applicants should have significant background in experimental reaction 
dynamics, pulsed molecular beams, and solid state laser systems. The 
prime directive of the experimental research program is to investigate 
the dynamics of dicarbon and tricarbon reactions with unsaturated 
hydrocarbons in combustion processes. A description of the current 
research group and projects can be found at 
http://www.chem.hawaii.edu/Bil301/welcome.html ; recent examples of our 
work are published in , for example, Chemical Reviews (102, 1309-1358, 
2002) and Int. Rev. Physical Chemistry (21, 307-356, 2002). To apply, 
please send a letter of interest, three letters of recommendation, CV,  
and publication list to Prof. Ralf I. Kaiser, Department of Chemistry, 
University of Hawai'i at Manoa, Honolulu, HI 96822-2275, USA, or via 
email to kaiser@gold.chem.hawaii.edu . Review of applications will start 
June 1, 2003, and continues until the position is filled.
