Hi Everyone,

As you all know, the MAP collaboration (now WMAP), has released its first
all sky map of the CMB anisotropy.  With this comes 13 papers discussing
the methods and results. I think it is a good idea to pay some attention
on them. Here is a web page where you can get high quality versions of the
papers.

Enjoy it and have a nice lantern festival!

Best regards,

Hwei-Jang Yo
