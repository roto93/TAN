Subject: Confirmation needed for one comet please?

 
Dear sirs/madames:
    We have been working on some orbits of past comets and we need
confirmation on one of them for our research paper.  We wonder if you
might be able to help us?
    There is a book written by Chinese astronomers of the past sitings of
a number of comets but I am told that the book is out of print.  Perhaps
you may have the book or know of someone who has one?  The book is A
Comprehensive Collection of Ancient Chinese Astronomical Records
(Zhongguo gudai tianziang jilu zongji), published in Nanjing in
1988.   The book was written by Mrs. Jiang and Mr. Xu, a husband and wife
team.    I sure hope that you can help us. 
    Perhaps you might know how I can get in touch with them, because
surely they have a copy of their own book.
    I would like to know if there is any record in that book or in any
other book on the history of comets of any being seen at these particular
times in the past :  933/March, 397/Jul, 140BC/Feb/, 675BC/Sept.,
1211BC/May, 1746BC/Dec, 2282BC/Aug, or 2818BC but with a perihelion of
about 0.85 AU?
     It was seen in 1468 at a perihelion of 0.85.  Here is a list of some
comets and their orbits that we just worked out lately.  It is from a
spreadsheet program.
     We sure hope that you can help us, please?
