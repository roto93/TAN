Subject: East Asian Young Astronomers Meeting 2003


The Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Academia Sinica (ASIAA) is
pleased to announce the first meeting of East Asian Young Astronomers to
be held in Taipei, Taiwan from November 9 to November 12, 2003.
                         
This ground-breaking event is jointly sponsored by ASIAA and the
Coordination Committee of East Asian Meetings of Astronomy (EAMA). The
meeting will bring together graduate students and postdoctoral fellows
from each of the four EAMA core regions -- China, Japan, Korea, and
Taiwan, as well as some excellent lecturers from these regions, to study
together, discuss research results, exchange recent information from each
region, and sow the seeds of collaboration in the East Asia at the
earliest opportunity.

The number of participants will be limited to approximately 50 postdocs
and graduate student. There is no registration fee, and the host in Taiwan
will provide funding for local expenses, including the welcome reception,
social events, and a banquet. All participants are invited to give oral
presentations on their research. More senior astronomers are also welcome,
but due to limited budget, we can not provide any financial support.
                         
We hope that this event will be repeated annually in years to come. A
formal announce of this meetings has been posted to the EAMA website.
Further details of the meeting will be posted to

free to contact us.

Again, we cordially invite you to participate the first meeting of this
exciting series.
