                         Announcement
                  CFD-MHD Workshop in Astrophysics:
       	    Numerical Methods and Astrophysical Turbulence
	       December 10, 2003 to December 12, 2003

The Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Academia Sinica (ASIAA) is
pleased to announce the 2003 CFD-MHD Workshop in Astrophysics: 'Numerical
Methods and Astrophysical Turbulence', to be held in CCMS-Physics
Building, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, from December 10 to
December 12.

This workshop will congregate many of the eminent researchers around the
world specialized in applications of computational fluid dynamics and/or
magnetohydrodynamics in astrophysical problems to share their most
state-of-art works in the field. In our program, the keynote speakers are
Bruce Elmegreen (IBM, USA), Peter Goldreich (Caltech, USA), and Frank H.
Shu (NTHU, Taiwan) for astrophysical turbulence, and Phil Colella
(UC-Berkeley, USA), Michael L. Norman (UC-San Diego, USA), James M. Stone
(Princeton, USA), and Paul R. Woodward (Minnesota, USA) for numerical
methods and applications to astrophysics. In addition to the keynote
speakers, we have 16 invited speakers, all world experts in the field. The
topics will cover a wide-range of problems in star formation, galactic
dynamics, accretion disks, astrophysical jets, and cosmology, as well as
numerical techniques.

The CFD-MHD workshop is planned in conjunction with a grand celebration
for the ASIAA 10th anniversary on December 10 that will feature a series
of scientific talks in the morning and early afternoon. The speakers for
the series are Charlie Townes, Jack Welch, Jeremy Mould, Peter Goldreich,
and Reinhard Genzel. We are glad we can host these two events together to
give people a rare chance to have a panoramic view of the foremost
research in astrophysics.

Scheduled also on Dec. 10, will be the poster presentation session.  The
posters will remain posted during the entire workshop. The number of the
posters is limited up to 25. They will be reviewed by the organizers of
the workshop and generally accepted on the first-come-first-serve basis.
So please send in your title and abstract as soon as possible when
registering.

If you are interested in this workshop, please register at the official
website http://cfd-mhd2003.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw.  Also, please take a look
for updated news and information. We will charge an NT$800 (US$25) fee for
each participant, covering the expenses of two lunches and one banquet,
plus programs and other paperwork.  If you have any questions about this
workshop, please e-mail to cfd-mhd2003@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw. Again, we
cordially invite you to attend this great event in CFD-MHD community.
