In August 2003, the VLBA will mark the tenth anniversary of
its opening ceremony.  In commemoration of this event, we
are planning an international scientific meeting, to be held 
June 8 - 12, 2003, in Socorro, NM, USA, on the contributions
of the VLBA, and VLBI in general, to astronomical and other
scientific disciplines, and on the future of high resolution
observations in astronomy.  The meeting is sponsored by NRAO
and New Mexico Tech.

Our overall goal is to review the exciting progress of VLBI
science and technology, and where the future lies.  We will
survey the current state of scientific progress in the broad
scope of astronomical, astrophysical, and geophysical fields
to which VLBI observations have contributed.  We also wish
to discuss future frontiers for VLBI, and for other high
resolution telescopes operating across the electromagnetic
spectrum.  Finally, we will consider the technological
developments that will be necessary to support these future
directions.

The major scientific topics of the meeting, and confirmed
invited reviews, are listed below.  In inviting these
speakers, the SOC sought to emphasize participation by
younger members of the community.  Contributed talks and
posters are solicited on any of the scientific topics.

IMPORTANT DATES

  14 March 2003  Abstract deadline for contributed talks and
                     posters
  15 April 2003  Payment deadline for early registration
    26 May 2003  Deadline for motel reservations
    23 May 2003  Third mailing, to registered participants
    8 June 2003  VLBA/VLA tours
    9 June 2003  First day of scientific sessions
   12 June 2003  Last day of conference


PRE-REGISTRATION & ABSTRACT DEADLINE

Anyone interested in attending the meeting is encouraged
to pre-register, and to take note of the abstract deadline
above.  Pre-registration and abstract submission forms are
available at the meeting website.


MOTEL RESERVATIONS

Detailed information on the availability of lodging for the
meeting is now posted on the meeting website.  We have been
able to reserve blocks of rooms at five local motels, com-
prising a total of 186 rooms.  Demand for lodging in Socorro
has increased significantly in recent years, due primarily
to counter-terrorism training at New Mexico Tech.  This
means both that a meeting such as ours can no longer command
particularly advantageous room rates, and that participants
are well advised to book rooms before our block reservations
expire on May 26.

Dear colleague,

As I'm sure you know, the next General Assembly of the International 
Astronomical Union (IAU) is to be held in Sydney, Australia, during 
13-26 July this year.

I'd like to remind you that initial abstracts for any oral or poster 
presentation must be submitted online by 1 March. (See 
www.astronomy2003.com under "Call for Papers".) If you are thinking of 
submitting an abstract but can't do so by the due date, please contact 
the organisers of the relevant meeting.

Please forward this mail to anyone you think may be interested in 
attending the General Assembly.

Regards,


Helen Sim
