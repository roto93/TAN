   Title: Instrumentation for cosmic ray experiments at CERN

   Time: Jan. 20 (Monday), 2003, 10:30 am

  Place: NCTS lecture Room, 2nd Floor, Computer Center Building, NCTU

  Abstract:
 Cosmic ray physics at very high energies has become a very active
 area in recent years. At the ``knee'' region of the cosmic ray energy
 spectrum, several experiments (surface detectors and underground
 experiments) are confronting their results on the composition of primary
 particles with energies around 10^{15}eV without a complete agreement
 among each other. With these datas in hand, many theorists are trying to
 explain some  aspects of these events, such as the galactic or
 extra-galactic origin of these events, obtaining huge uncertainties mainly
 due the inadequate knowledge about the characteristics of hadronic
 interactions above accelerator energies. The dedicated high energy
 experiments such as L3-LEP (and more recently ALICE) at CERN,
 using their high precision apparatus may start playing a crucial role
 in this direction. In this talk, I will  present some recent results about
 our work in three different cosmic ray experiments at CERN:
 CORAL (Cosmic ray experiment at LHC),
 ACORDE (A cosmic ray detector for ALICE) and a Two
 surface cosmic ray detector array correlated data, at CERN.
