Dear Yi-Jehng, 

  Could you circulate this on TAN when you get a chance?  Thanks.

*** Dynamical and Chemical Evolution of Star Clusters ***

The workshop on Dynamical and Chemical Evolution of Star clusters will be held
Nov 24 to 28 at National Central University, Taiwan .  The Workshop derives 
from,  
but not limited to, the ongoing Taiwan-Baltic collaboration on open cluster 
studies.  
So far some 20 talks have been scheduled, with topics ranging from using star 
clusters 
as probes to Galactic structure and evolution, to observational techniques of 
star clusters.    
Information about the Workshop and the scientific program can be found on the 
webpage

  http://140.115.34.77/TaiBalConf.htm

We have reserved a block of rooms at the university guest house for foreign 
participants. 
Domestic participants who also plan to stay on campus during the Workshop should 
contact 
us for arrangements before Nov 15th.  The room should be reasonably well 
accommodated, but
you should bring in your own hygienic kit.   

For foreign participants, please make sure we have your itineraries so we can 
arrange for your
accommodation and airport pickup.  

Paper presentations have either 40 or 30 minute talks.  Nominal PC, overhead, 
and real-object 
projectors are available.  If you need an additional equipment please let us 
know in advance.    
You are welcome to present posters.  Please contact us for arrangement.  

The weather at this time of the year is mild, usually in mid-20s to mid-10s.  A 
light jacket 
suffices.  If you plan to join the trip to Lulin Observatory, which elevates to 
nearly 3000 m, 
the night-time temperature is close to freezing so warm clothing is required.  
Scattered rain 
is always a possibility.  Taiwan's electrical system uses 110 V with A-type plug 
(shaped like '11').  
You will have Internet connection at the conference venue.  No Internet service 
is currently 
available at the guest house.   

Inquiries should be sent to chinwei.chen@msa.hinet.net or call 886-3-4262302.

Look forward to seeing you soon. 

Chin-Wei Chen, on behalf of the LOC
