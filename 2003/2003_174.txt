Dear Colleagues:

     I am sending you the scientific program of the 2003 CosPA
International Symposium on November 13-15, 2003 - just a few days away.

     In this message, you should be able to identify names, titles, and
the time slots, and even more. Please feel free to disseminate this
information to postdocs and students, especially those who might be
interested. It is not too late to register by visiting the website
www.cospa.ntu.edu.tw or call Vicky Chen at 02-3366 5187.

     Please note that the symposium concert and the post-conference tour
are also exciting events, as indicated at the end of the enclosed
message. I sincerely hope that entertainments and stimulations could help
you become more creative and original in your research life.

     I look forward to seeing you at the Conference.

                                     Best wishes, W-Y. Pauchy Hwang
