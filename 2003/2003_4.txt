Dear Colleagues,

We will change the speaker of CosPA Joint Groups Meeting on January 13.
The original lectures will postpone to January 15.
Sorry for the inconvenience.

Title:  SLAC E-165 Experiment: Fluorescence in Air from Showers.

Abstract:
Recent observations by HiRes/Fly's Eye and AGASA indicated an apperant
descrepancy in the spectra of ultra-high energy cosmic rays above 1E18 eV.
Because of the importance of the physics involved, both experiments are
 investigating possible systematic effects.  One such effect is the air
 fluorecsece efficiency assumed by HiRes.  In this talk we discuss an
 experiment to be carried out at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
 (SLAC) to measure precisely the spectral efficiency for fluorecsence
 excited by monoenergetic particles, as well as particles from showers
 in an air-equivalent target.
