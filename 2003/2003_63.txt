We are very glad that Dr. Alexei Fridman, a Russian Academician and the
leading Russian dynamist in astrophysics, will visit NCU on April 15
(Tuesday).  Dr. Fridman has worked in many different areas in
astrophysics and earth science.  We have invited him to give a lecture on
"Physics of Planetary Rings" at 10:00 am, Rm 1013 on the day of his
visiting.   It is a great chance to learn from Dr. Fridman and I
encourage you to attend.
