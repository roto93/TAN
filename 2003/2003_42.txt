Subject: LOT time request for Apr to Jun 2003

Call for Observing Proposal --- Lulin 1 m 

Proposals for observing time on the LOT are solicited for the 2003-II
season (April to June).  The first 3 months of operation faced some CCD
detector and filter wheel problems, but the telescope performed to its
expectation, especially after fine-tuning in the last week of February.
LOT now has an RMS pointing close to 10" and tracking (no guiding) 
accuracy of 0.4" in 10 minutes, well exceeding its specs.  The newly 
brought Princeton Instrument 1300 CCD camera arrived in early March, which 
will be adapted with the existing filter set (broadband and line filters) 
before the new filter wheel shows up in May.  The PI1300 camera is capable 
of 1 MHz readout and very good electronic specs.  We will characterize the 
camera as soon as possible and expect it will go online for the 2003-II 
season.  Statistics shows that in the last fall/winter season, there was 
about 50% observing time (e.g., 300 hours in October to December 2002).  
If this spring will be as dry as last year, the coming April to June may 
still have some usable nights.  

The deadline for the current proposal cycle is March 15.  Feel free to 
contact me for any questions you may have.

Star and Telescope 8 Workshop on "National Observatory of Taiwan?"

  The 8th "Star and Telescope" workshop (ST8) will be held on March 21,
Friday, this time at NCU, to focus on if and how Taiwan should have a
national observatory.  The possibility may range from a managing
consortium of observing facilities, to an umbrella organization to cover
all branches of astrophysic studies, including observations and theory
groups for optimal overall planning and prioritized use of resources.  

  You are invited to participate in this activity, or better yet, to
contribute a talk or your viewpoints.  We hope to gather a program with
speakers briefing on how Americans, Mainland Chinese, Japanese and Korean
are doing as far as similar, national observatory infrastructure goes, and
if any effort or planning has been initiated for Taiwan.  Needless to say,
your active participation is very much encouraged.  If you can volunteer 
to speak, please let me know.  

  I will keep you all posted as the program gets finalized.  Meanwhile
please mark your calendar on March 21, Friday, at NCU.  The workshop
will start at 11 am and usually ends by 4:30 or so.
