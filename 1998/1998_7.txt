Dear Assians,

     Just a reminder that there will be a planetary science meeting here in 
July.  Would you like to attend or contribute?  Also, please look at the program 
to see who are coming.  We will organize a Kuiper Belt mini-workshop associated 
with the meeting.  Any interest to organize other similiar topical 1 day 
workshop?  Please contact me.
