			FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT

		          A Workshop on

       	GRAVITATIONAL COLLAPSE LEADING TO STAR FORMATION

               October 4 - 6, 1998, Toronto, Canada

     Hosted by the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics



	Dear Colleagues,

	This is the first announcement about a workshop on the topic
	GRAVITATIONAL COLLAPSE LEADING TO STAR FORMATION, to be hosted
	by the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics on 
	October 4 - 6, 1998. The workshop is being organized by
	Doug Johnstone and Shantanu Basu.

	The time is right to have a focused workshop on the
	important problem of gravitational collapse. Recent advances
	in observational capacity mean that we are now detecting infall
 	signatures and the earliest protostellar phases. This comes
	on the heels of increasingly sophisticated theoretical models
	for collapse. We intend to bring together the leading researchers
	in the field. Is there a consensus on how stars form?
	What are the important unresolved issues?

	Please fill out the form below if you are interested in 
	attending and email it to either one of us (basu or johnstone
	@cita.utoronto.ca). Please do bring the workshop to the 
	attention of postdocs or students who are working with you.

PROGRAM

	The workshop will consist of full day sessions on Sunday,
	October 4 and Monday, October 5, and a half-day session
	on Tuesday, October 6.

	Topics to be covered include, but are not limited to:
	-structure of dense cores
	-infall signatures
	-mass accretion onto protostars
	-hydrodynamic collapse 
	-collapse in the presence of magnetic fields
	-models for multiple star formation
	-the link between collapse and the formation of disks and outflows
	-the role of waves/turbulence in support and collapse


LOGISTICS

	The meeting will be held at the University of Toronto.
	The weather in Toronto is temperate at this time of year,
	and Ontario is renowned for its brilliant fall colors.

	Information about lodging in and around the University of
	Toronto will be provided in subsequent announcements.

	There is a very limited amount of funding available to 
	provide partial support towards travel for graduate students
        and young postdocs.

	We are aiming to keep registration costs to a minimum, and will
	provide more details once we have a better idea of the number 
	of participants.

   

INDICATION OF INTEREST

	Please return the form below to basu@cita.utoronto.ca or
	johnstone@cita.utoronto.ca if you are interested in attending.
