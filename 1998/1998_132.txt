Subject: 1998 Western Pacific Geophysics Meeting
Content-Length: 11186

Dear TANists,

There will be an AGU (American Geophysical Union) meeting in Taipei
this summer. The meeting is called Western Pacific Geophysics Meeting
(WPGM) and it will be held during July 21-24 (Tuesday-Friday) at 
Taipei World Trade Center.

So does it have anything to do with astronomy?  Well, the answer is
YES.  There are two SPECIAL SESSIONS which might be of your interests:
I) Planetology,  II) Solar-Planetary Physics and Aeronomy.  Some useful
information is listed below for your reference.

Cheers,
Yi-Jehng Kuan
