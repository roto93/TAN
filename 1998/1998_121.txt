Dear TANists,

By the time you see this message, you probably are all aware of
that Prof. Ue-Li Pen is on his Vacation:-)

First of all, I want to thank Frank Chen, ASIAA's System 
Administrator, who first spotted the infinite loop problem and
fixed it at 2 AM early Monday morning. I also want to thank 
those TAN subscribers who figured out what went wrong and 
gave me the advice.  Anyway, I should have prevented it from
happening but, oh well, my fault.  No excuse here.  Please 
accept my 1,000,000,000... apologies.

Now I have modified my program and hopefully it will catch those
run-away looping from those out-dated va cation programs. Usually 
such a program will not forward/reply mails from itself but 
it may not be the case for an older version of Sun OS.

Sorry again for what have happened.  Hopefully it will never
happen again (but until then no one can be certain:-) .


Cheers,
Yi-Jehng Kuan
