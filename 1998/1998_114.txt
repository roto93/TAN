                       Texas Grand Tour

The tour to Texas covered three places, Lubbock, San Antonio and Houston, in
a week. Visited Texas Tech Univ. (TTU), South West Institute (SWI) and Lunar
and Planetary Institute (LPI). Gave three seminars based on the book,
"Photochemistry of Planetary Atmospheres" (Yung and DeMore, Oxford), that is
coming out this summer. My hosts were Prof. Greg Gellene (TTU), Randy Gladstone
(SWI) and Julie Moses(LPI). Randy and Julie were my former students in
Planetary Science (PS).

05-19-98  Tuesday

0900  Leave for airport.

0530  Arrive at Lubbock. Prof. Greg Gellene picked me up and we had dinner.
Lubbock is a city of 200,000 people, described by Greg as a place one hates to
visit but loves to live in. Why? Not exciting with cultural monuments or
inspiring with majestic sceneries, but a nice decent place with low cost of
living and good schools and God fearing people. Texas is part of the southern
Bible Belt, and Lubbock is the buckle of the belt. I showed him part of my
seminar the next day on "Deuteronomy of Mars" and asked him if my mixing up the
holy scripture and PS would offend some religious sensibilities.

I have never heard of TTU, Lubbock or Gellene until I read his Science paper in
1996, proposing a new theory, Symmetry Induced Kinetic Isotope Effect (SIKIE),
to explain an outstanding puzzle in the isotopic enrichment of atmospheric
ozone discovered by Mauersberger in 1981. This theory is so abstruse that
I had
to get Chip Miller (then at JPL, now on faculty at Haverford) to give us a
lunch hour tutorial. I thought a visit to Lubbock would allow me to learn more
from the mouth of the horse. I was excited by a sweeping statement in the SIKIE
paper ---- that this effect is so general that it applies, in principle, to all
elements. Well, between me and Mark Allen we cover all molecules in the universe,
from Earth to planets, comets and molecular clouds, and now biochemicals
(astrobiology). If SIKIE is universal, rather than a peculiar quirk of the O3
molecule, I have a market for it in the whole universe, and I want to benefit
from its sales before the competition figures that out...

You see, the eternal optimist is one who has to seek out new opportunities rather
than waiting for them to drop into your lap.

05-20-98  Wednesday

830  Greg picked me up from the hotel. Greg is an Associate Professor of
Chemistry in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry. His group does
research on the isotopic fractionation mechanisms using both theory and
measurements.  Greg had arranged my schedule so that I talked to a different
professor every half hour! I will not report on all these meeting, only ones
that are interesting to my Caltech audience. The interesting things I learned
include fuel cells, synthesis of chiral molecules (for drug applications),
quantum chemistry of excited states, quantum tunnelling of heavy atoms,
spectroscopic (i.e. non evasive) detection of cancerous cells ...
The chemistry itself is not new to me, but the creative and imaginative
applications are. As a result, I found the department very interested in our
work on applying quantum chemistry to the solar system. They are a bunch as
much on the fringe of chemistry as I am.

1100  talked with Prof. Wilse Robinson. He is the Welch Professor, a big shot
here. He used to be a professor in Chemistry at Caltech and was Mark Allen's
thesis advisor. He left just before I came here, so we never met before. Wilse
is a very broad chemist, but for the last decade his major work was on the
physical properties of water. He has solved the mysteries of all the puzzling
properties of water, including the density maximum at 4 deg C. He said the
ideas went back to a 1968 paper by Barclay Kamb in the crystal structure of
ice. But Barclay was not believed by the chemists because he did not have all
the spectroscopic data now available. Anyway it took thirty years to come back
to Barclay. Wilse is giving a seminar here at Caltech in the middle of June on
this subject, the topic of his recent book.

1200  Gave seminar on application of isotopic kinetics in the solar system.
About 30 people showed up. Judging from the questions, there was a lot of
interest in the subject. One of the people in the audience was Prof. Karllson,
a former postdoc of Robert Clayton. He discovered the 18-O and 17-O anomalies
in the water in SNC meteorites in 1992.

0100  Lunch with Karllson. Discussed SNC. Toured his lab, a junkyard of ancient
instruments, some of which looked like WWII navy surplus equipment (I used to be an
experimental physicist and could recognize some of the junk).

0400  Had a long discussion with Greg on isotope fractionation. Went through
all his recent papers ---- all displayed on the walls in the hallway. There is
no doubt that SIKIE is a real phenomenon, but is it the only explanation of the
ozone isotopic effects? And how universal are such effects? Greg will spend
many years to find out.

0600  Left for San Antonio via Dallas

1000  Randy picked me up from airport. His house was 10 min. away. Met his wife
Irene. I was to sleep in their 9 yr old daughter Lizzy's room. She had to sleep
with her parents.

Randy told me two good news. He read on the NASA news release that we
(JPL/Caltech consortium) have been funded for Astrobiology --- that is the $ 5
million new initiative to look for life elsewhere. Then he told me another
"irrelevant news". He would serve on a panel review for NASA comparative
planetolgy --- that had just received only 19 proposals!!! Normally a program
like that would have received 91 proposals, so fierce is the competition these
days. I told him one of the 19 is the one I wrote with Ken Nealson on
astrobiology. That is good news for me. Further discussion might be a conflict
of interest.

05-21-98  Thursday

0700  Breakfast with the Gladstones. Lizzy was really cute little girl.
Extremely winsome, with the classical Grecian cut. Fortunately, Shau May had
armed me with a present for her. She liked it very much and wanted my address
so that she could write a thank you note. She wanted to be a landscape
architect.

0830  SWI is a private institute with 2500 employees, most in very practical
things like testing automobile engines, machine oil etc. The place has twelve
"fiefdoms", or Indian tribes, often warring against each other, though, so far
without cannibalism. Randy is in the Space Division. They are involved with
aeronomy of earth and planetary atmospheres.

Randy is doing very well scientifically. A search in TOC yields more than 40
recent publications. He has become the guru of radiative transfer of UV light,
a subject everyone needs but nobody wants to touch. Randy provides the service
to the UV community. He does innovative research, funded by the NSF, on the
theory and applications of radiative transfer.

1000  Talked to Bill Lewis. We had to deal with each other a lot when he was
the associate editor of GRL. I think I referee more papers than anyone, because
I get papers in chemistry, radiation, climate change, planets, earth,
paleoclimate, evolution, origin of life ... Lou Frank's paper was published
when Bill was in charge.

Well, I think the problem is finally resolved, definitively at last. Randy
showed me two preprints by Mozer et al. from Berkeley. The two papers
demonstrated that the signals used by Frank were artifacts of the instrument
---caused by a flaw in its design. These papers were the most convincing that I
have ever seen on this controversial subject. Beautiful analysis.  A classic
lesson in statistics.

1200  Lunch with Randy, Rosemary Killen, Hunter Waite, and a few others at a
French restaurant.

0300  Gave seminar on comparative study of Earth, Jupiter and Titan, showing
the importance of biology on Earth to about 15 people.

0400  Met with Hunter's group on what to test in the photochemistry of Titan in
the upcoming Cassini mission to Saturn. The hard thing to do next is to figure
out how simple hydrocarbons form aerosols.

0600  Left San Antonio for Houston.

0700  Julie picked me up from airport.

0800  dinner with Julie, Randy (her significant part), and Joe Hahn (her
colleague at LPI). Julie had just bought a beautiful new house for about 1/3 of
its price in LA. She cooked swordfish dinner for us. Randy is a Space Station
engineer. He conducts simulation training for astronauts before they go up
there. I advised him on a scheme to use the simulation technology to make lots
of money, and of course give some to PS research one day.

05-22-98  Friday

0600  Up for a short walk around Julie's neighborhood. Beautiful Yuppie high
tech suburb. Smelt and felt like the neighborhood of Silicon Valley that I visited
last Dec.

0830  Visited LPI, a small private place for PS. 11 Ph.D.'s. Has a new building
with two floors. Very neat, elegant, quiet. In recent years this place is best
known for being the place to conduct NASA proposal reviews.

Met Walter Keiffer (former PS student) and Renu (former Peter's postdoc) in the
hallway. Carried out an exciting discussion whether the motion of the
barycenter of the solar system could affect climate. The barycenter moves
because of the motion of Jupiter. Will it affect the amount of solar
insolation? Renu was last year's winner of the Urey Prize, a rising star in PS.

Poor Walter had 4 hrs sleep in the previous 48 hrs --- in getting his proposal
out. Matt Pritchard was a summer intern at LPI with Walter. He sent his regards.
Adam worked here for two summers with Renu.

Julie said LPI wants to hire more PS people, although it does not want to advertize
for positions. Albert, Adam, Ash, send in your resumes.


1000  Long discussion with Julie on her recent work on Saturn. There were new
beautiful data from ISO, a joint US-Europe satellite. Julie did a great job on
the CO, CO2 and hydrocarbons on Saturn. It shows the power of photochemical
models in constraining the meteoritic fluxes into planetary atmospheres.

1200  Lunch with Julie and others.

0100  Discussed with Julie what I should present so that the geochemists at LPI
would be interested.

0300  Seminar on what we learned about ices and atmospheres from isotopic
fractionation of hydrogen and deuterium. About 20 people came, many from JSC.
There was great enthusiasm for the possible interpretation of the SNC
meteorites. The highlight of my seminar is a preview of the June 6
issue of Science, on the evolution of water on Mars. There are two isotope
papers in that issue, D/H by Krasnopolsky et al. (Randy is a coauthor) and
oxygen isotopes in SNC. Our part (me and Dave Kass) is a 1,000 word commentary
on these two papers. But Dave and I put together the whole story --- based on
last 20 yrs of work, starting from my paper in 1976, when I was visiting PS as
a postdoc from Haravrd. The beautiful (I mean Mars, not me) story is as follows.

Once upon a time there was 100 m equivalent of ocean on Mars (Earth has 3 km
ocean) that happily sustained life and carved out all the channels. But Mars is
too small, unprotected by magnetic field. Water was lost to space via the escape
of H and O. Now there are only 10 m of water left, locked up in the poles,
equivalent to a polar cap of 1000 km in diameter. This is about all the ice we
have in the terrestrial polar caps.

How do we know that the water escaped? The escape left a heavy residue, in the
heavy water on Mars (discovered by Owen in 1988) and in the SNC meteorites
(discovered by Karllson and Thiemens). For the first time, we achieve this
consistency, as follows.

1. The 100 m initial water is close to what geologists want to carve out the
river channels on Mars

2. The 10 m residue is close to what MGO altimeter measured at the poles,
result that Dewey is happy about.

3. The isotopes and the atmosphere and geology are telling the same story.

Why do we need Mars to learn this evolutionary history of the solar system?
Here is the answer.

"Returning to the title of this perspective, Deuteronomy, we should note
that Moses cautioned the people to remain faithful to God in the midst of the
pagan Canaanite culture they were about to enter. We will leave it to the
reader to decide which culture (kinetics or thermodynamics; escape or
exchange) is ``pagan''.  The reader may wonder why we need to
learn about the history of the Martian climate. The reason is that
Mars can be viewed as a laboratory where drastic climate change
experiments were carried out, and because it does not
have plate tectonics, the records of the experiments (written in the language
of isotopic fractionations) are preserved. Similar evidence on Earth
has been continually destroyed by tectonics
and reequilibration. The tablets of Moses have been wiped clean.
Deuteronomy (Second Law) may be found in the Temple of another planet."

      "Deuteronomy: a puzzle of deuterium and oxygen isotopes on Mars",
       Yung and Kass, to appear in June 6 issue of Science.


0530  Invited Julie, Walter and Renu to seafood dinner. Randy could not come.
It is always fun to talk to former graduate students about old days. It seems
looking back through the dim corridor of time, things are more beautiful, more
innocent even poetic. All the old animosities are diluted, old rivalries
forgotten, old injuries forgiven. They now realize what we did as teachers seemed
harsh then, but was for their good. Time heals all wounds, because our mind has
finite (not infinite) viscosity. That is, over sufficiently long time, even
rock flows like water, obliterating injuries and cavities.

1000  Julie has a huge number of science fiction books. Started to browse some of
them before drifting off to sleep on another planet, in another galaxy.

05-23-98 Friday

0600  Up for a neighborhood walk. Neighbors friendly here --- unlike the image
of tough gunslinging Texans that I read about in cowboy books in my youth.

0730  Breakfast with Julie. Gave her whole lecture on marriage, family, kids
and human values. Julie is so rational and so independent that she needs no
advice from anyone. Her logic is so precise that for the only time in twenty
years that after the final Ph.D. exam, the exam committee could not find a
single error in her thesis. I never changed a single word she wrote in our
joint papers. She made infinite number of changes in my writing, though.

My lecture to her was essentially on the evolution of human values, from a kid
to old age. Unfortunately, there are certain values, e.g. decision about having
kids, that change drastically with aging, and there is no way to correct an
earlier mistake. I told her that one of the greatest joys in my life was the
day when I conducted a deep discussion on moral issues with my son. In the
West all such moral issues are recorded in the Bible, as divine truths revealed
to the prophets, and for thousands of years these truths have been taken as
the universal basis as human civilization. Now we try to put all these on a
foundation of rationalism, but we are not there yet. That is why we still need
to rely on the empirical experience of the past, such as that from an old
professor and father of two kids.

My kids as my biological extension are a fulfillment; as my intellectual
partner, a joy; as my moral companion, a gift from heaven.

Discussed a couple of collaborations we will be carrying out --- both old and
new problems, including one that Jim Friedsen and I did not solve ten yrs
ago, but may be solvable now.

0900  Left Houston for LA.

0200  Home in time for the cutting ceremony of Wing Ning's birthday cake.

This is the end of my grand tour of Texas. There is reward in the life of a
professor. Even though there is no money, prestige or power in our profession, I
conclude that we are respected and loved by our students and colleagues, and
that is something that neither money prestige, or power could buy. Thus
renewed, I am ready to pass on this set of values to my new students and my kids.
