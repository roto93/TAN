2.  NEW EDITOR-IN-CHIEF FOR THE ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL

The Council of the American Astronomical Society, in a special 
meeting on October 29, approved Professor Robert C. Kennicutt, Jr. 
of Steward Observatory, the University of Arizona, to succeed 
Dr. Helmut A. Abt of the Kitt Peak National Observatory as the
Editor-in-Chief of The Astrophysical Journal.  The transition of 
editorial responsibilities is currently being planned, but is 
expected to take place sometime in the summer of 1999.  
Dr. Kennicutt's appointment was recommended by a special search 
committee chosen by the AAS Executive Committee.  The recommendation 
was endorsed and forwarded to Council by the AAS Publications Board.

Details of the editorial transition plan will be announced in The
Astrophysical Journal, the March AAS Newsletter, and in subsequent 
AAS electronic communications.  In the interim, authors should 
continue to deal with Dr. Abt in the customary manner.

6.  ANNOUNCEMENT FROM AURA ON GNIRS
    By Goetz K. Oertel

NOAO is experiencing difficulties with the Near Infrared Spectrograph.
NOAO is developing "GNIRS" as a US instrument for the International 
Gemini Project.  GNIRS is up to two years behind schedule and will cost
about $6 Million to complete.  AURA and the International Gemini Project
conducted senior reviews of GNIRS at NOAO this fall.  NOAO is developing 
a recovery plan.  NOAO and Gemini are managed by AURA.  Details about 
the GNIRS situation will be posted soon on the web page of NOAO at 
http://www.noao.edu/noao.html.
 
Significant difficulties have also been experienced by other builders 
of instruments for 6 to 10 meter aperture telescopes in the USA and
elsewhere. A workshop is being planned for spring 1999 to review 
lessons learned.
