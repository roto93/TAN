           EUROPEAN  VLBI  NETWORK   -   CALL  FOR  PROPOSALS

  *************************************************************************
  *        THE  EUROPEAN  VLBI  NETWORK  (EVN)  INVITES  OBSERVING        *
  *        PROPOSALS FOR  THE    FEBRUARY  1ST,  1998    DEADLINE.        *
  *        RULES  FOR  SUBMITTING  APPLICATIONS  ARE  GIVEN  OVERLEAF.    *
  *************************************************************************

      The EVN consists of an international Consortium of institutes in Europe
and Asia which operate radio telescopes for VLBI. Observations can be recorded
in MK3 format at all observatories, and may be processed using the correlator
at MPIfR in Bonn. Further information can be found at the EVN WWW Home Page: 
  http://www.nfra.nl/jive/evn/evn.html.    Consult the EVN STATUS TABLE under
"Proposing to use the EVN" for the availability of antennas, and the observing
wavelengths and recording systems which are supported. To subscribe to the
VLBI e-mail information exploder, send the message "subscribe vlbi" in the   
body, not subject line, of an email to:   Majordomo@zia.aoc.nrao.edu

      The EVN encourages use of the Network by astronomers not specialised in
the VLBI technique. The Joint Institute for VLBI in Europe (JIVE) can provide
support for scheduling, correlation and data analysis of EVN projects, as well
as information during proposal preparation. Please contact Michael Garrett
(mag@jive.nfra.nl) for the name of a support scientist. Proposers affiliated
to non-EVN institutes within the European Union may take advantage of the EU's
TMR programme "Access to Large-Scale Facilities". This provides travel and
other financial support for PIs (and their co-Is) to visit JIVE or the EVN 
observatories for correlation or data analysis. Contact Garrett for details.

                      OBSERVING SESSIONS IN 1998
                      --------------------------
   Session 1  Feb 11 - Mar 04   1.3 cm,   6 cm (+MERLIN),  18 cm    
   Session 2  May 27 - Jun 10     6 cm,  18 cm (+MERLIN )  3.6cm 
   Session 3  Sep 09 - Sep 30  ***  HALCA ONLY ***  6 cm, 18 cm
   Session 4  Nov 11 - Dec 02     5 cm ,  6 cm,  18 cm  +  3.6 cm ?

      Proposals received by 1st February will be considered for scheduling in
Session 2, 1998, or later. The number of large experiments scheduled which 
require the MPIfR correlator will probably be limited in the next few 
sessions, due to the relatively large backlog of projects awaiting processing.
The planning of wavelengths for future sessions is not fixed, although most
will include both 6 and 18 cm, in order to support the EVN committment for
co-observing with the orbiting space-VLBI telescope HALCA. Other wavelengths
may be scheduled, depending on proposal pressure.  

              JOINT OBSERVATIONS WITH THE VLBA, MERLIN AND DSN
              ------------------------------------------------
      Proposers may also request EVN antennas together with other telescopes
and arrays. "Global" proposals combine the EVN with the NRAO VLBA and/or other
US antennas, creating an array of up to 20 elements, ideal for very high
dynamic range imaging, and "snap-shot" observations of many sources. 

  >>> PROPOSERS SHOULD USE VLBA-MODE RECORDING FOR GLOBAL EXPERIMENTS and 
  >>> request the use of the VLBA correlator. Valid modes are given in file
  >>> OK_modes.vlba, available from:   ftp.aoc.nrao.edu  directory: pub       

      Combined EVN+MERLIN observations add the short MERLIN array baselines 
to those of the EVN, as well as providing VLBI baselines to the CAMBRIDGE 
antenna. EVN+MERLIN observations at 18 cm are planned for session 2, 1998.

      Antennas of the NASA DSN, in particular at Robledo (Madrid), will be
available for a few projects requiring very high sensitivity, in each EVN
observing session. A specific justification must be made in the proposal.

                    RULES FOR SUBMITTING PROPOSALS
                    ------------------------------
1) Any request requiring 2 or more EVN antennas constitutes an EVN proposal
   and must be sent to:         Dr. R. Schwartz, EVN Scheduler, MPIfR, 
                                Auf dem Huegel 69, D 53121, Bonn, GERMANY.
   Separate requests are not necessary for EVN+MERLIN or EVN+DSN proposals.
   See points 5 and 6 for proposals also requesting VLBA or other facilities.
   Proposals must be received by 1 February 1998. A list of Project Codes and
   Principle Investigators for all proposals received will be posted on the
   EVN WWW Home Page under "EVN Program Committee".

2) The VLBI Proposal Coversheet should be used for all proposals. Copies can
   be obtained from:      http://www.nfra.nl/jive/evn/proposals/prop.html
   The desired observing wavelengths, antennas, sources and GST ranges,
   recording mode and correlator must be specified. 

  >> If appropriate, specify the GST range for Sh and Ur antennas separately. 

  >> For all spectral line proposals, INCLUDING MK3 MODE OBSERVATIONS, the
  >> number of (BB) channels, sample rate, and bits/sample must be given

3) The text, which SHOULD NOT EXCEED 2 SIDES, should contain both a scientific
   and a technical justification for the resources requested, and should 
   include a brief summary of any related EVN proposals which have been
   observed or scheduled. Up to 2 additional sides with diagrams may be
   included; the total, including cover sheet, should not exceed 6 sides.

  >> Proposers should identify any individual EVN or non-EVN antenna(s)
  >> whose participation is considered essential for achieving their goals.

  >> Special justification is needed for DSN antennas, and EVN-MERLIN

4) Proposals submitted by FAX cannot be accepted. Proposers are encouraged to
   submit by e-mail (although NOT if this is at the expense of excluding help-
   ful diagrams). They must be in Adobe post-script format, concatenated 
   into a single file, and sent to :        proposevn@HP.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de
   An automatic machine reply will be returned if the email has arrived.

  >>>  Send proposals A FEW DAYS BEFORE the deadline; only in this case
        can senders be notified if the file fails to print !!
  >>>  Write a 3-4 word title as the subject line for proposal identification
  >>>  Avoid grey-scale plots, which can create very lengthy files.
  >>>  Avoid sending proposals in duplicate
  >>>  DO NOT SEND THE FILE "UUENCODED" OR AS A "MIME" MAIL ATTACHMENT !
  >>>  IF you specify paper size for printing, only specify size A4

5) EVN Global proposals which also request the VLBA, other US antennas (eg GB,
   VLA) or the VLBA correlator (including all projects requesting VLBA mode 
   recording) must ALSO be sent to:    The Director, NRAO, Edgemont Road,
                                       Charlottesville, VA 22903-2475, USA
   Requests for the EVN with a single VLBA antenna must also be sent to NRAO.
   E-mail submission (with same rules as in (4)) to:      propsoc@nrao.edu
   (but do NOT specify A4 size for printing)

6) Requests for other antennas NOT affiliated with the EVN or NRAO should
   be indicated in the proposal, but the PROPOSER MUST SEND A COPY of the
   proposal to the Director/Scheduler of the observatory involved, and will
   be responsible for arranging all aspects of their participation, including
   scheduling, tape supply and observing support.

7) Proposals which request the Bonn correlator must be limited in size to 6
   correlator "passes". This translates to a telescope limit of 12 for MK3
   modes B,C and E, and 9 for mode A (no cross-polarisation); and 9 for mode C
   and 5 for mode A with full polarisation correlations. Projects which exceed
   these limits, or are recorded in VLBA mode, must be correlated at the
   VLBA correlator, and thus constitute "Global" proposals. (see point 5) )

8) All communication between the Proposer(s), and the EVN Program Committee or
   Scheduler will be via the Contact Author designated in the proposal. The 
   results from proposal review will be communicated after the next meeting of
   the EVN Program Committee, and will be SENT BY EMAIL unless otherwise 
   requested in the proposal Abstract.

9) "Short" observations (< 4 hours) may be proposed up to 6 weeks before an
   observing session begins, by means of a brief justification to the 
   Chairman of the EVN PC, who will, at his discretion, authorise scheduling
   in any gaps in the session plan. The present Chairman is:   Richard Porcas,
   MPIfR, Auf dem Huegel 69, D 53121, Bonn, Germany.  FAX: +49 (0)228-525229 ;
   TELEPHONE: +49 (0)228-525288 ;       E-mail: porcas@mpifr-bonn.mpg.de

Note that the following data from the proposal will be stored in machine-
readable form:  PI name, wavelength, observing mode, title of program,
requested telescopes, EVNPC rating. The data will be distributed to the EVN
Scheduler, VLBA scheduler and to members of the EVNPC. For proposals supported
under the TMR program "Access to Large-Scale Facilities", the title, author
list, and amount of time granted (or a brief reason for rejection) will be
made available to the EU Commission in Brussels.
