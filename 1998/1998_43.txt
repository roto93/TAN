City, you can find connecting flights from Mexico-City to Leon every day. 
Alternatively it is possible to fly to Mexico City and to take a bus from 
there to the city of Guanajuato (it is approximately, a 5 hour trip and
involves a transfer by taxi from Mexico City Airport to the bus
station ``Terminal del Norte'').
