>UK ASTRONOMERS FIND FAINT OBJECTS BEYOND PLUTO
>
>UK astronomers have discovered two of the faintest objects ever
>seen orbiting our Sun. One is estimated to be 150 km (90 miles)
>across and the other 110 km (70 miles). Both are about 45 times
>farther from the Sun than Earth (4,200 million miles or 6,750
>million km), and more remote than the planet Pluto, which is
>currently 30 times farther from the Sun than Earth. The objects
>belong to the so-called Kuiper Belt in the region of space
>beyond the planet Neptune. Since 1992, 61 Kuiper Belt objects
>('KBOs') have been discovered, including 7 found by the same
>UK team. Most are over 200 km across.
>
>But rather like the curious incident of the dog that famously did
>nothing in the night-time [in the Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes]
>it is the fact that the team DID NOT find more objects that may
>prove to be a highly significant clue as astronomers probe the
>mysteries of these outer reaches of the solar system. Based on
>present ideas about how Kuiper Belt objects formed, astronomers
>expected to be finding these faint objects at even greater
>distances. Since they did not, those ideas may need to be revised.
>It may be that the average size of the KBOs is smaller the farther
>away they are, so the most distant ones were too faint even for
>this survey. Or it might be that the objects actually discovered
>mark the outer edge of the Kuiper Belt.
>
>These latest results will be presented at the National Astronomy
>Meeting at the University of St Andrews on Tuesday 31st March
>by Dr Alan Fitzsimmons of Queen's University Belfast on behalf
>the team, which also includes Miss Edel Fletcher (Queen's
>University of Belfast), Dr Mike Irwin (Royal Greenwich
>Observatory) and Professor Iwan Williams (Queen Mary &
>Westfield College London).
>
>Hardly any previous searches have been targeted on objects as
>faint and as small as those the UK team were looking for when
>they made the observations in November 1997. They used the
>2.5-metre Isaac Newton Telescope on La Palma to image the sky
>for 7 nights, searching a total area slightly smaller than that
>covered by the full Moon. On the telescope they had a new,
>sensitive, wide-field camera built by the Royal Greenwich
>Observatory. The new camera can see five times as much sky
>as the one previously used.
>
>During each night they stared continuously at different patches
>of sky for up to four hours at a time. In each patch of sky several
>thousand distant stars and galaxies could be seen. However even
>these images were not sensitive enough to record the solar
>system objects the team were seeking. So they combined the
>images by computer in a way that eliminated all stars, galaxies
>and nearby asteroids and revealed only faint solar-system objects
>at large distances from the Sun.
>
>Two new objects were discovered. One is roughly 150 km in
>diameter, while the other is only 110 km across. Both appear to
>be around 45 times further from the Sun than the Earth. At this
>distance, the smallest object was forty million times fainter than
>the faintest stars that can be seen by eye on a dark night. They are
>so faint that it is not worth taking up all the telescope time
>needed to track them in the future, and it is very unlikely they
>will ever be seen again.
