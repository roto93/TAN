NRAO Scientific Staff Appointments

The National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) invites applications for
appointments to the scientific staff at our facilities located in
Charlottesville, Virginia; Green Bank, West Virginia; Socorro, New
Mexico; or Tucson, Arizona.  Requirements include a Ph.D. in astronomy,
astrophysics, physics, or related fields; a minimum of three years of
postdoctoral experience; and a record of ability and leadership in radio
astronomy.  Initial appointments will be for a period of three years
beginning at the rank of Assistant Scientist, with the possibility of an
eventual permanent appointment, including AUI tenure.  In exceptional
cases, a more senior initial appointment may be considered.

NRAO operates the Very Large Array (VLA) and the Very Long Baseline
Array (VLBA) from Socorro, NM; the 12-meter millimeter wavelength radio
telescope from Tucson, AZ; and is completing the construction of the
100-meter Green Bank Telescope (GBT) in WV.  The Observatory has also
begun detailed design and development for the construction of the
Millimeter Array, to be located in Chile, and is planning for the
upgrading of the VLA.  Potential applicants may obtain further
information about the NRAO and opportunities on the scientific staff
from our Web site (www.nrao.edu) or may contact Dr. K. I. Kellermann
(804 296-0240).

All members of the NRAO scientific staff are expected to contribute to
the operation and future development of the Observatory as a national
facility for a broad user community, as well as maintain a vigorous
program of individual independent research.  Current staff activities
include planning for the MMA and the VLA Upgrade; commissioning of the
GBT; 12 Meter, VLA, and VLBA operations and planned enhancements;
development of new instrumentation and image processing techniques; and
public outreach.

Applications should be sent to the Director's Office, NRAO, 520 Edgemont
Road, Charlottesville, VA, 22903-2475 and should include: a letter with
a description of research interests, an outline of proposed research
plans, a discussion of how you might contribute to the NRAO, a
curriculum vitae, and the names of five scientists who have been asked
to send letters of reference directly to the NRAO.  All application
materials and supporting letters received at the above address by
January 15, 1999 will receive full consideration.

The National Radio Astronomy Obsrvatory is operated by Associated
Universities, Inc., (AUI) under a cooperative agreement with the
National Science Foundation.  The NRAO is an equal opportunity employer
(M/F/D/V).
