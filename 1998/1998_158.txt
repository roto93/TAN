Re:  MARSHALL SHERFIELD POST DOC FELLOWSHIPS IN SCIENCES OR   ENGINEERING

Please inform relevant junior faculty and doctoral candidates about the
following post-doctoral research fellowships for 1 year and up to 20,000
Pounds Sterling at a British university or research institute.

This is a new fellowship, founded in 1997 by the British Government to mark
the 50th anniversary of the Marshall Plan.

The aim of the Marshall Sherfield Fellowships is to introduce US scinetists
and engineers to the cutting edge of UK expertise which will, in turn,
build longer-term contacts and international links between the US and UK in
key areas of science, technology and engineering.

The Fellowships will support research in any area of the hard sciences,
technology and engineering.  Candidates must by US citizens and hold a PhD
in a relevant subject. There is no age limit.

Candidates will be expected to pursue high level research during their
Fellowship.  The Fellowships will be tenable from 1 April 1999.

Application deadline: 13 October 1998 (postmarked)
