1.  SAN DIEGO ABSTRACT DEADLINE
    Wednesday, 8 April 1998, 9pm EDT 

Abstracts for presentations at the June AAS Meeting in 
San Diego, CA are due in the Executive Office next Wednesday,
8 April.  See the online Meeting Announcement for further 
instructions.

	http://www.aas.org/meetings/aas192/prelim/prelim.html

If you submit your abstract using the web form, you will
notice we are experimenting with a previewer.  The previewer is
designed for checking administrative information and LaTeX syntax.
The LaTeX translations will be done at a later date and will
appear in the published versions of your abstract.

2.  CONGRESSMAN BROWN TO OPEN AAS MEETING

Congressman George Brown (D-CA) has agreed to speak to the 
AAS meeting Monday, 8 June at 8:30am. This should be a speech 
worth hearing.  Known as one of the most thoughtful men in 
Congress, Representative Brown has been a longtime friend of 
science.  He is currently the Ranking Minority Member of the 
House Science Committee.  The meeting schedule has been 
rearranged to accommodate the Congressman's need to return to 
Washington for an important vote. The exact title of the 
speech has not been finalized at this time. 
-- Peter B. Boyce --

3. IMPORTANT CHANGE IN AAS JOURNALS

Beginning with the 1998 January Astronomical Journal, the 
1998 June 10 Astrophysical Journal (Parts 1 and 2), and the 
1998 July Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series, the journals
will be printed on matte coated paper stock, making separate
plate sections unnecessary.  The material formerly found in the
plate section at the end of each issue will be included within 
the text of each article.  The Astrophysical Journal Letters 
will continue to be limited to four journal pages of text, tables, 
and figures (including what were previously called plates).

4.  COMPARATIVE  PLANETARY RESEARCH

The Dear Colleague Letter can be found on the NSF web site at:
        www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/getpub?nsf9871

The corresponding NASA Research Announcement can be found on 
the NASA web site at:
        www.hq.nasa.gov/office/oss/nra/98-oss-04/

5.  FAR ULTRAVIOLET SPECTROSCOPIC EXPLORER 
    GUEST INVESTIGATOR PROGRAM

The NASA Research Announcement (NRA) for the Far-Ultraviolet 
Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) Cycle 1 Guest Investigator Program 
has been released.  The NRA, electronic proposal template, and 
other information of interest to prospective proposers are 
available at:

	http://fusewww.gsfc.nasa.gov/fuse/

Letters of intent are due 9 April 1998, but are not required to 
propose for observing time.  Full proposals are due 8 May 1998.

Please note that on 16 March 1998 an updated version of the FUSE 
Observer's Guide (V1.1) was posted on the FUSE Science Center 
web site:

        http://fuse.pha.jhu.edu/

NASA has recently decided to reschedule the FUSE launch from 
October 1998 to February/March 1999.  This change does not effect 
the Cycle 1 proposal deadlines.
