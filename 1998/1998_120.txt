			      Announcing the
	   Multimission Archive at the Space Telescope Science
			     Institute (MAST)


   STScI is proud to announce the creation of the Multimission Archive
   at STScI (MAST).  MAST is built on the success of the Hubble Data
   Archive and takes advantage of its existing archive infrastructure.
   MAST is supported by NASA under a cooperative agreement between STScI
   and Goddard Space Flight Center.  The MAST WWW interface is at
   http://archive.stsci.edu/mast.html.  To help our users to keep up
   with this expansion, I summarize here the data available through the
   MAST:

   - the Hubble Data Archive (HDA), as of May 1998, contains over 4.9
   Terabytes of science and engineering data, for a total of
   approximately 140,000 science exposures.  In the past few months the
   volume of archived data has reached average rates of about 4 - 5
   Gigabytes/day, while 3 - 4 times as many data per day have been
   retrieved by archive users.

   - the International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) Final Archive.  This
   contains over 104,000 spectral images of approximately 10,000
   individual astronomical sources (covering the 1,200 to 3,350
   Angstroms range) obtained by IUE over the course of its lifetime
   (from 1978 to 1996).  Experienced IUE staff members are also
   available to assist researchers working on IUE data.

   - the Copernicus Archive.  This includes far- (900 - 1,560 Angstroms)
   and near- (1,650 - 3,150 Angstroms) ultraviolet spectra of 551
   objects, primarily bright stars, obtained by the Copernicus
   satellite, otherwise known as the Orbiting Astronomical Observatory 3
   (OAO-3), from 1972 to 1981.  

   - the Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer (EUVE) Archive, which at present
   contains spectroscopic observations (in the 70 - 760 Angstroms range)
   of about 300 sources, mostly Galactic.  EUVE, launched in 1992, is
   still operational.  

   - the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (UIT) Archive.  This contains 758
   images of 193 targets (covering the 1,200 - 3,300 Angstroms range)
   obtained by UIT-2 as part of the ASTRO-2 mission.  UIT-1 data will be
   supported in the near future. 

   - the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-centimeters (FIRST)
   Archive.  The FIRST project is designed to produce a radio survey at
   20 cm (1.4 GHz) of over 10,000 square degrees down to a flux of 1
   mJy.  STScI provides access to the radio images and the source
   catalog, which currently includes about 437,000 entries, at
   http://sundog.stsci.edu.

   - the Digitized Sky Survey (DSS).  The Catalogs and Surveys Branch of
   the STScI has been digitizing the photographic Sky Survey plates from
   the Palomar and UK Schmidt telescopes in order to support HST
   operations and provide a service to the astronomical community.

   STScI plans to incorporate additional ultraviolet and optical data
   sets into the STScI archive in the future, including data from the
   Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) currently scheduled for
   launch in early 1999.  The Multimission Archive at STScI can be
   accessed at http://archive.stsci.edu/mast.html.  E-mail inquiries
   about the STScI data archives can be directed to archive@stsci.edu.

            MAST Cross-correlations with Astronomical Catalogs

   How many quasars at redshift > 4 have been observed by HST?  How many
   Seyferts with magnitude brighter than 15 have IUE spectra?  Now you
   can get the answer to these and many other questions by using our new
   cross-correlation interface, available at
   http://archive.stsci.edu/search/.

   Using this interface, you can select Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) by
   class, redshift, magnitude, and 6cm radio flux from a catalog based
   on the Veron-Cetty & Veron (1996) catalog, and cross-correlate them
   with the HST, IUE, and EUVE archives.  (For HST, you can select
   individual instruments, each with a different correlation radius.)
   Multiple missions can also be selected, with the option to show only
   those AGN that cross-correlate with EVERY selected mission (so you
   can look for AGN that have been observed with both HST and IUE, or
   for AGN observed with either HST or IUE.)  After the correlation is
   performed, you can preview the images/spectra (at present only in the
   case of HST data), and retrieve the data.

   This new interface is part of our effort to let the user take
   advantage of the MAST (Multimission Archive at STScI) by allowing the
   cross-correlation of astronomical catalogs with the various archives
   available.  We are expanding this interface by including cluster,
   galaxy, and stellar catalogs.  At present, a user-supplied list of
   positions can also be cross-correlated with any of the MAST archives.

   All archival researchers are invited to use this new service and let
   us know how we can improve it.  As usual, all comments and inquiries
   should be directed to archive@stsci.edu.

			    MAST UIT ASTRO 2 Support

   MAST is providing access to the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (UIT)
   data obtained during the second ASTRO mission at
   http://archive.stsci.edu/uit/.

   UIT was one of three instruments which comprised the ASTRO 1 mission
   flown on the space shuttle Columbia from December 2-10, 1990.  The
   second ASTRO flight, aboard Endeavor, was from March 3-17, 1995.  The
   UIT mission has been managed by Principal Investigator Theodore P.
   Stecher of the GSFC Laboratory for Astronomy and Solar Physics
   (LASP).  UIT exposures were obtained on 70-mm photographic film and
   later digitized using a Perkin-Elmer microdensitometer.  Image
   resolution was 3" over a 40' field of view and exposures were made in
   the 1200-3300 Angstrom range using broadband filters.  UIT-1 obtained
   821 exposures of 66 targets and UIT-2 obtained 758 images of 193
   targets.

   GSFC Astrophysics Data Facility (ADF) and MAST staff members worked
   together to obtain a copy of the UIT-2 data from the UIT project.
   MAST was then provided a copy of the UIT-2 data and the associated
   database.  MAST staff will now fill moderate requests for UIT-2 data.
   MAST plans to archive both UIT-1 and 2 data but has not yet received
   a copy of the UIT-1 data.  UIT-1 data will continue to be available
   through NDADS
   (http:///ndads.gsfc.nasa.gov/ndads/archives_homepage.html)
