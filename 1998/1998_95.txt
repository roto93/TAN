Greetings All:

Recently I have been asked to serve on a committee to study concepts for the
data archive for the Next Generation Space Telescope.  The committee is
interested in developing a model for the process that scientists use when
they are conducting astronomical experiments.  The committee is interested
in discerning the relative amounts of time that scientists spend working on
the various parts of the process.  If you have a few free moments and would
be interested in contributing to this study, please assign relative weights
to the activities listed below and return the survey NO LATER THAN MAY 15 to
ngst@cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov.  Names will not be connected to the results;
however, if you wish to remain totally anonymous and would like to
contribute, feel free to print this out and send your response via the post,
to Susan Hoban, Code 930.5/CESDIS, NASA/GSFC, Greenbelt, MD 20771.

Thanks in advance for your input.

Susan Hoban
