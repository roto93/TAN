  RELEASE of the SECOND ANNOUNCEMENT OF OPPORTUNITY for the VSOP MISSION
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS) has released
the Second Announcement of Opportunity (AO2) for scientific
participation in the VLBI Space Observatory Programme (VSOP). 
Proposals are solicited for observations at 1.6 and 5.0 GHz with the
dedicated space radio telescope, HALCA, and ground-based radio
observatories to perform Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) on
baselines of up to 2.6 Earth diameters.

AO2 solicits proposals for observations between 1 January 1999 and
31 December 1999, although some AO2 proposals may be scheduled as early
as October 1998 if this enables better (u,v) coverage to be obtained.

General Observing Time is open to the astronomical community through
proposals to be peer-reviewed by an international scientific review
committee; proposals are due at ISAS by Friday, 8 May 1998.

Copies of the AO and proposal Cover Sheets, are available from the 
VSOP World Wide Web site at 
       http://www.vsop.isas.ac.jp/obs/AO.html
or via anonymous-ftp in the pub/docs/ao directory of
       ftp.vsop.isas.ac.jp   (133.74.2.131).
These documents will also be made available through a number of regional
sites, which will be advertised on the VSOP WWW site.

A Proposer's Guide and simulation software packages supporting the
Announcement of Opportunity will be available from 1 March 1998.

Please note that proposers wishing to continue, or complete, programs
started during the first AO period must submit a proposal in response
to this Announcement of Opportunity.

Regional e-mail Help Desks for assisting potential proposers through
the VSOP AO process have been established. Questions related to the
AO, proposal submission, technical aspects of the mission, or user
software that are not addressed by the AO or Proposer's Guide can be
submitted to these Help Desks; see the AO for your region's e-mail
address.  Responses normally will be within a few working days.

          VSOP Project Scientist
