Subject: Compact Array Disruptions

***   URGENT MESSAGE   ***

This is to advise all users of the Australia Telescope=92s Compact Array an=
d
Mopra Observatories of operational disruptions resulting from heavy rain
and flooding in the Narrabri and Coonabarabran areas.

At Mopra the underfloor cavity in the equipment room was inundated on 18th
July, causing cessation of all use of the telescope. Repair works are
continuing, but are hampered by limited access to the site because of
floods locally and in Narrabri.

The Mopra Observatory is not expected to return to normal operations before
1st August. The Compact Array continues to operate reliably, however access
to the observatory by both staff and visitors has been difficult because of
severe flooding in Narrabri and between the town and the observatory.

At present staff normally resident at the observatory are operating the
Compact Array and are following a partly altered observing schedule.=20

The heavy rain has also caused substantial delays to the North Spur
construction. This has caused a delay in the array re-configuration into
the 6C array which was scheduled for 27th July.
The array will be re-configured as soon as possible, but not before 4th
August.

In addition the delays are expected to impact the scheduling of
observations during the early part of the 98 September Term.

Investigators whose 98MAYT programs are affected are being notified.

Regular scheduling at Parkes is expected to continue, although at this
stage this cannot be co-ordinated with any Compact array observing.
