                              INTRODUCTION
To promote nonlinear science in the Asia-Pacific region, we will follow
the trail blazed by Dynamics Days and start an Asia-Pacific branch.  The
Hong Kong conference will mark the beginning of a regular series of
conferences that will rotate among the Asia-Pacific countries.

                             VENUE AND DATES
The conference will be held in the Lam Woo International Conference Centre
of the Hong Kong Baptist Univeristy, 13-16 July 1999.

                             CALL FOR PAPER
The conference consists of invited talks, contributed talks and poster
sessions.  Contributed talks will be selected from the papers submitted.
To submit a paper, you should attach a one-page abstract including the
title, author(s), and an abstract of less than 100 words.  The format of
the abstract can be obtained from the website or via e-mail.  The deadline
for receipt of paper is 1 February 1999.

                              ACCOMMODATION
1. Most participants will be housed in the Dr. Ng Tor Tai (NTT)
   International House of the Hong Kong Baptist University.  It is a brand
   new housing unit conveniently located next to the conference site.  The
   address is:

	NTT International House
	Hong Kong Baptist University
	32, Renfrew Road
	Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong
	Fax: (852) 2191-9333
	Tel: (852)2301-2301

Since the number of rooms in the NTT International House is very limited,
it'll be reserved on a first-come-first-serve basis.

2. If there are not enough rooms in the NTT International House, 
   participants will be housed in the YMCA International House.  However,
   one needs to take a bus or taxi to get to the conference site.  The
   address is:

	YMCA International House
	23 Waterloo Road
	Kowloon, Hong Kong
	Fax: (852)2771-5238
	Tel: (852)2771-9111
	Email: ymcares1@netvigator.com  OR
	       rsvndept@ymcaintlhousehk.org
	website: http://www.ymcaintlhousehk.org

Participants have to contact YMCA to make their own reservations.  Please
mention the name of the conference to obtain the special rates:

	Standard Twin		Tower Twin
	Single HK$330/day	Single HK$440/day
	Double HK$165/day	Double HK$220/day

Tower Twin is a newer wing and has bigger rooms.

                REGISTRATION FEES AND PAYMENT INFORMATION
1. The regular registration fee is HK$1,500 (approx. 1US$=7.8HK$).  But if
   you register before 1 February 1999, you will be charged an early
   registration fee of HK$1,200.  Local participants, participants from
   developing countries, and full-time students will be given substantial
   discounts.  The registration fee entitles you to the conference,
   refreshments, banquet, etc.

2. One night's deposit of HK$330 for a Single and HK$165 for a Double is
   required of all participants who intend to stay at the NTT
   International House.  For a Double, you can put down the name of your
   preferred roommate.  We'll try to accommodate your wish as much as
   possible.  However, in case there is no one to share the room, you have
   to pay the full price

3. You can pay by bank draft or credit card.  Make checks payable to "Hong
   Kong Baptist University."
