Dear Colleague:

We would like to announce that the 2MASS Sampler Data Release 
is now open for public access.  You can access the Sampler from 
the IPAC/2MASS Web site at http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/2mass/ or 
directly from the NASA/Infrared Science Archive site at 
http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/.

The Sampler release consists of a Point Source Catalog, an
Extended Source Catalog, and compressed Atlas Images for one
night of data obtained at our northern facility.
  
The 2MASS Sampler webpage contains general information about
this data release, including sky coverage, images of interesting
objects in the Sampler, catalog characteristics, etc.  Also available 
on the 2MASS site is documentation for the Sampler release (A 
"Micro" Explanatory Supplement).  Assistance with the Sampler is 
available via the 2MASS Help Desk at 2mass@ipac.caltech.edu.
	 
A CD-ROM containing the Sampler data will also be distributed 
at the Austin AAS meeting in January.

The 2MASS Project

(The Two Micron All Sky Survey is a collaboration between The University 
of Massachusetts [Dr. Michael F. Skrutskie, Principal Investigator] 
and the Infrared Processing and Analysis Center [JPL/ Caltech]. 
Funding is provided primarily by NASA and the NSF.)
