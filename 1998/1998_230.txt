>
>
>AN ANNOUNCEMENT
>
>The Second International Conference on New Theories, Discoveries and
>Applications of Superconductors and Related Materials (New3SC-2)
>
>CALL DOE PAPERS (FIRST CIRCULAR)
>
>Background
>
>After more than ten years no consensus has emerged concerning the physics
>of high-temperature superconductivity (HTS) although much hard work has
>gone into attempting to understand HTS based on the well-known BCS
>(Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer) theory. Since New3SC-1, there appears to have
>been no appreciable change in this situation.  It is therefore extremely
>important and necessary to keep all the passages open in the research on
>superconductivity before a consensus is reached.  Undoubtedly, a good
>understanding of the physics of HTS is essential for the development of
>applications.  Also, it is important at this moment to encourage and
>foster friendly and peaceful debates in the community concerning whether
>or not a new physical picture is needed to fully understand both low- and
>high-temperature superconductivity.  Therefore, benefiting from the wisdom
>and efforts of more co-chairs, we are calling New3SC-2 in 1999.
>
>Objectives
>
>The conference will focus on new ideas, new concepts, and new models of
>the mechanism and origin of superconductivity, especially those new
>results that appear to exhibit a breakthrough either conceptually or in
>the applications they generate.  It is highly desired to compare recent
>models and theories with reliable and reproducible experimental results
>obtained on high quality materials.  Thus, we expect that there are more
>and more un-biased experimentalists and open-minded theoreticians who may
>join this effort.  Liberal discussion time will be provided throughout the
>conference, so that experts in theory, experiment, and engineering of both
>superconductors and related magnetic, electronic, and ferroelectric
>materials can exchange thoughts and present their work to a diverse
>international community.  Conventional work will be welcome as a stimulus
>to synergistic exchange of ideas.  The intent is to highlight the
>contributions of young and lesser-known researchers as well as those of
>senior scientists.
>The purpose of this conference is to attempt to foster friendly and
>peaceful debates, and to see if a radical change is needed in the
>fundamental approach to superconductivity, or if the conventional
>approaches are likely to bear fruit soon.
>

>Abstracts
>
>Prospective authors should submit their abstracts by electronic
>mail, preferably in LaTeX.  An abstract template will be made
>available on the conference web site; or request it by e-mail.
>Abstracts in a plain text form or Microsoft Word format are also
>acceptable, but the final submission of paper manuscripts must be
>written in LaTeX.  Please indicate your sorting code on the upper
>right corner according to the codes enclosed in parantheses in the
>Topics section. The name of the presenter should be underlined.  A
>mailing address, e-mail address, phone, and FAX number of the
>corresponding author should be included near the bottom of each
>abstract. Whenever possible, all correspondence will be conducted
>by e-mail.
>Authors are encouraged to post their work before or after the oral
>presentation in order to discuss it with colleagues. A poster room
>is available. Please indicate your preference regarding both oral
>and poster presentations or either of them on the upper left
>corner.
