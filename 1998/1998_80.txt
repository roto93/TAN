ARISE Science Workshop First Announcement
-----------------------------------------
A two-day workshop focused on the science to be done with the
proposed ARISE future space VLBI mission will be held in Green
Bank, West Virginia, on 1998 August 19 and 20 (Wednesday and 
Thursday).  ARISE is included in the long-range roadmap
for the Structure and Evolution of the Universe theme of NASA.  
The purposes of the workshop are to increase community
involvement in determining the science to be done with the mission,
and to develop a more detailed scientific case for ARISE for
the upcoming astronomy decade committee.  There will be one
or two presentations summarizing the mission and its technical
status, but the remainder of the workshop will be devoted to
the scientific goals of ARISE rather than to technical details
of the mission.

The workshop will be organized around several key science areas
to be addressed by ARISE, such as gamma-ray blazars, high-frequency
polarization VLBI of AGN, and water megamasers and masers.  It
is anticipated that there will be sessions on each of these topics,
including one or two invited talks of about 30 minutes in length, 
plus shorter contributed papers and considerable time for discussion.  
These talks would present the scientific rationale for particular 
observations, and an important aspect will be a description of the 
technical requirements on the spacecraft that are needed for those 
observations.  

About 1.5 days will be devoted to the science sessions.  The
remaining 0.5 days will be used for tours of the GBT facilities,
and of the Green Bank Earth Station that is presently used for VSOP
tracking.  On the morning of the 21st, after the workshop concludes,
there will be an open meeting of the ARISE ad-hoc science advisory group
to discuss the results of the workshop and the impact on ARISE
planning.

For more information about the workshop, including the 
tentative schedule and a registration form, please see 
http://www.nrao.edu/~julvesta/arise_gb.html.  You may also
contact the meeting organizer, Jim Ulvestad, at julvesta@nrao.edu.  
Contributed papers, some of which may be posters, should be proposed 
on the registration form or by contacting the meeting organizer.
For reservations and accommodations, please contact Becky Warner at
