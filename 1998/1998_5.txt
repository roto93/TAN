<center>***       AUSTRALIA TELESCOPE NATIONAL FACILITY       ***


Applications for observing time are now invited

for the following telescopes:


Compact Array, Narrabri

Parkes Radiotelescope

Mopra Antenna, Coonabarabran

and for VLBI Observations using any or all of the above.



*****************************************************************

*     CLOSING DATE for applications is 15th February 1998       *

*     4 MONTH Observing term MAY to AUGUST 98 (98MAYT)          *

*****************************************************************


IF THE CLOSING DATE FALLS AT THE WEEKEND OR ON A PUBLIC HOLIDAY

IT IS EXTENDED TO 1700 AEST ON THE NEXT WORKING DAY


Application forms are available in WWW

NEW COMPACT ARRAY CONFIGURATIONS 

The 98MAYT period will begin on 30 April 1998 

when the Array will be in the 750A configuration. 


Normally the standard configurations available for 98MAYT would be 6C,
1.5B, 1.5C, 750B & 750C.  However, two projects that affect the operation
of the Array will be commenced during the 98MAYT period.  These are


*	the construction of the NS-spur and four new stations on the EW-track
and

*

*	the installation of solid panels on the surface of one CA antenna.

*

Both these projects aim to improve Array performance at short
wavelengths. 

Information on the Array upgrade project can be found at
<underline><color><param>0000,0000,fefe</param>http://www.atnf.csiro.au/mnrf/mnrf.html

</color></underline>

It is anticipated that as much as two months of the observing term will
be affected by these projects.  During the construction work the Array
will be offered for astronomy on a "shared risk" basis. During that time
there may be loss of time on part or all of the Array with only short
notice given.   To optimise Array usage during this period two new
temporary configurations will be offered.  These are 750E and 750F
(described below) which use only the western part of the EW-track and so
minimise conflict with the NS-spur construction.  

They will replace 750B and 750C which were scheduled for 98MAYT. 

 

To summarise, observers are invited to propose projects using
configurations 750A, 6C, 1.5B, 1.5C, 750E & 750F. 


New Compact Array configurations 


The new configurations are defined below.  These can be compared with
other configurations by referring to The Guide for Observing with the
Compact Array 

(<underline><color><param>0000,0000,fefe</param>http://www.atnf.csiro.au/Documentation/ca_obs_guide/ca_obs_guide.html</color></underline>).

INTERFERENCE AT NARRABRI NEAR 13-CM WAVELENGTH


Since the beginning of April 1997, intense radio interference has been
experienced in the frequency band 2300 - 2400 MHz.  This has been in the
form of  several 'spikes' occurring at intervals of 14 MHz across the
band.  This unexpected interference appears to be transmitted from Mt
Dowe, east of the Compact Array.  Investigations are continuing;  it is
suspected that the signals result from tests associated with future
Pay-TV channels in bands set up as Multipoint Distribution Stations (MDS)
by the Spectrum Management Agency in Canberra.  


The consequence of this is that interference-free continuum observations
are no longer possible in the 'recommended' Compact Array 13-cm band
centred on 2368 MHz.  A band centred at a higher frequency of 2495 MHz
appears to be a suitable  alternative.



MOPRA

There may be some restrictions to usage of Mopra during 98MAYT, but
proposers should assume that the standard systems at Mopra (including the
3mm receiver) will be available for much of the term.

PARKES

The Parkes Radiotelescope will be available for the entire 98MAYTerm.
