Australia Telescope National Facility, CSIRO 
BOLTON POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP


Applications are invited for the Bolton Fellowship, a three-year
post-doctoral appointment tenable at any of the Australia Telescope
National Facility locations. Bolton Fellows are encouraged to undertake
research in any area which exploits ATNF observational capabilities, and
have ample opportunity to make innovative contributions to the development
of the Facility. The ATNF facilities provide unique opportunities to
observe the Southern sky including the Magellanic Clouds and the richest
part of our Galaxy.

The ATNF, a Division of CSIRO, has its Sydney Headquarters at the
Radiophysics Laboratory, and operates the Parkes 64m telescope, the
Narrabri 6km Compact Array and the Mopra 22m telescope near Coonabarabran.
The Compact Array is currently being enhanced to operate in the 12mm and
3mm bands and by the addition of a short northern spur. A major recent
development at Parkes is a 13-beam receiver operating in the 20cm band,
primarily for HI and pulsar surveys. With other Australian and overseas
antennas, the ATNF telescopes operate as a VLBI array which uses the
broad-band S2 recording system. The Headquarters site is shared with CSIRO
Telecommunications and Industrial Physics and the Anglo-Australian
Observatory, which operates 4m Anglo-Australian and Schmidt optical
telescopes near Coonabarabran.

The Fellowship is named in honour of John Bolton FRS, a pioneer of radio
astronomy who made the first identifications of extragalactic radio sources
and who worked at the CSIRO Division of Radiophysics between 1947 and 1981. 

Applicants must have (or will shortly satisfy the requirements for) a PhD
degree in astronomy, astrophysics or related disciplines. The Bolton Fellow
will receive an annual salary in the range $A44K to $A50K plus benefits. A
relocation allowance is payable. Bolton Fellows also receive a
discretionary research allowance of $A20K over the three-year term.

Applications should include a curriculum vitae, list of publications,
statement of proposed research, and the names and addresses (preferably
email) of three referees, and should be addressed to The Director, ATNF
CSIRO, P.O. Box 76, Epping NSW 2121, Australia.  The closing date for
applications is December 1, 1998.
