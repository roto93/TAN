      Under a new agreement between the EVN and NRAO, the EVN Program
      Committee alone will now review all proposals which request the
      VLBA correlator for processing EVN observations. This supersedes
      the previous arrangement whereby NRAO review was also required
      (which remains in effect for Global proposals requesting both 
      arrays). The agreement is for a limited duration and will be 
      reviewed in the light of progress with the JIVE correlator (see
      http://www.nfra.nl/jive/correlator/status.html for current status)
      The number of EVN projects which may use the VLBA correlator is
      limited by both correlator and thin tape availability. The EVNPC
      will therefore decide the priority for its use, based on its
      assessment of the scientific merit and needs of the proposals and
      the suitability of either the VLBA or MPIfR-Bonn correlators.
      It is expected that spectral line projects will be selected for
      most of the VLBA correlator allocation. All projects chosen will be
      recorded on thin tape and it is expected that observers will
      use VLBA/MK4 recording modes. Observers should consult the list
      of "Validated VLBA and VLBA-Compatible Mark 4 Recording Modes" in
      file "OK_modes", available via the EVN WWW page under "Scheduling
      EVN experiments". Spectral line observers should also read the
      note in that file regarding "self-spectra" from MK4 format
      recordings correlated at the VLBA correlator.
            The EVNPC encourages proposers of EVN spectral line 
      projects to request the VLBA correlator (at the appropriate
      place on the VLBI Proposal Cover Sheet). Other proposers should
      only request use of the VLBA correlator if there are strong
      scientific grounds for doing so. However, they should clearly
      indicate whether use of the MPIfR-Bonn correlator and MK3 mode
      recording could also fulfil the scientific requirements of the
      proposal, so that EVN time can still be granted if the VLBA 
      correlator is not available for the observation.
       

      The 1st JUNE DEADLINE is the last opportunity to propose for 
      the special EVN-only observing session at 6 GHz, planned for
      the November 1998 session. The antennas at Jodrell Bank, Onsala,
      Effelsberg, Medicina and Torun will be available for observing
      the spectral lines of METHANOL at 6.67 GHz and EXCITED-STATE OH 
      at 6.03 GHz. Interested observers are encouraged to submit  
      proposals for this unique observing opportunity.
            The November session will include some days of EVN+MERLIN  
      time at 5.0 GHz. This provides an array which combines a dense
      u,v coverage with high sensitivity at intermediate resolutions,
      ideal for imaging sources with complex structures on scales of
      5 - 200 mas.

      The EVN Call for Proposals, instructions for EVN and Global
      proposal submission, and the "OK_modes" file for VLBA/MK4
      recording are available from the EVN WWW home page :
