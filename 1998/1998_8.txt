Subject: Les Houches summer school on Space Infrared Astronomy

>From James Lequeux, Observatoire de Paris (lequeux@mesioa.obspm.fr)

Dear Colleague,

I would like to inform you about a summer school I am organizing together with
Dr. Fabienne Casoli:

            INFRARED SPACE ASTRONOMY, TODAY AND TO-MORROW
 		Les Houches (France) 4-28 August 1998

The purpose of this school is to teach a new community of astronomers, 
physicists and chemists, on why and how to use the truly unique body of data 
which are presently being gathered by the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) of
the European Space Agency. All these data will be put progressively in the
public domain starting in May this year. They concern essentially all the 
classes of objects of the Universe, with the exception of the Sun and the Moon. 
They will be of interest not only to astronomers but also to physicists (in 
particular solid-state, atomic and molecular physicists), and even to chemists.
The participants will also be prepared to use the many new facilities for 
infrared and submillimeter astronomy which are coming soon. I would like to 
emphasize that research on astronomical archival data, for example those coming
from the Hubble Space Telescope and soon from ISO, barely requires anything 
else than a good workstation, a limited amount of commercial software (much 
software being free), and access to the Internet WEB.

Please, consider to attend yourself the school, to send graduate students, 
and forward this information to colleagues who might be interested. 

The School will feature basic courses covering all the aspects of infrared
space astronomy, given by the very best experts. These lectures will be
accessible to persons with very limited or even no background in astronomy.
Practical work will allow to reduce, visualize and manipulate real data
from ISO and to compare them to data obtained at other wavelengths. We
hope to be able to use 4 UNIX stations with 10 terminals, for an expected
number of 50 students. The work will be supervised by well-trained specialists.

We realize that a 4-week school require a substantial involvement on the side
of all the participants. This length is however a prerequisite for efficiency.
The magnificient setting of Les Houches facing the Mont Blanc, the infinite
possibilities for hiking or mountain climbing during the week-ends, and
also the good food and usually warm atmosphere at Les Houches should offer
a welcome compensation and reward.

The School fee is 4600 French Francs including housing, food and teaching.
Fellowships will be available under request to cover part of all of this fee 
for persons who really need them. They might even cover travel expenses in 
some cases. 

Further information can be found below. You can also see the following URL:
http://www.ujf-grenoble.fr/HOUCHES
where you will find useful information as well as an inscription form. You
can also ask me directly for this form. The filled information form should
be sent to the School together with 2 support letters. The deadline is
1 March 1998.

Looking forward to seeing you at Les Houches,
Yours sincerely

James Lequeux

Infrared Space Astronomy, today and to-morrow 

Scientific Direction:   Fabienne Casoli (Observatoire de Paris, France)
		 	James Lequeux (Observatoire de Paris, France)

- General presentation of infrared astronomy : M. Harwit (USA)
- The Infrared Space Observatory (ISO): M. Kessler (ESA, Spain) and J.-L. Starck
	(CEA, France)
- Solar system : T. Encrenaz (Observatoire de Paris, France)
- Stars and galactic structure : H. Habing (Leiden Observatory, The Netherlands)
- Interstellar matter and star formation: F. Boulanger et P. Cox (IAS, France),
	A. Natta (Arcetri Observatory, Italy)
- Normal galaxies : G. Helou (IPAC, Cal Tech, USA)
- Active galaxies : R. Genzel (MPE, Germany)
- Cosmology : J.-L. Puget (IAS, France)

In addition to these general courses, time will be reserved for practical work
on actual data from the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO), using workstations and
appropriate softwares. A number of more specific lectures will be given, either
by invited speakers or school attendees. In particular, the future facilities 
for infrared and submillimeter astronomy will be presented. 

All celestial bodies emit in the infrared, and half of the radiation of galaxies
lies in this wavelength range. This domain is crucial for studies of the solar
system, of stars at the beginning and the end of their lifes, of interstellar
matter, of nearby as well as very distant galaxies. Recent developments of
observational techniques have been tremendous; one airborne observatory and two
satellites, IRAS and ISO, have been dedicated to this domain, and many more are
to come. An incredible variety of results have been obtained and many years of
work will be necessary for exploiting them adequately.
 
The purpose of this school is to attract a new community of scientists, from
graduate students to senior researchers, to this field of research. They will
learn the bases of infrared astronomy, and how to use the archival data of the
Infrared Space Observatory. This will help to prepare themselves for the many
future infrared and submillimeter space facilities: ODIN (launched in 1998),
SWAS (1998), WIRE (1998), MAP (2000), SOFIA (2001), SIRTF (2002), IRIS (2002),
PLANCK SURVEYOR (2004), FIRST (2006) etc.
