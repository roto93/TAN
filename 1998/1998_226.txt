Session 1:  Colloquium (2:30 - 3:30 pm)

            SPEAKER: Dr. Park Yong-Sun (ASIAA)
	    TITLE:   "Survey of the HCN J=1-0 hyperfine lines 
	              towards class 0 and I sources"
            ABSTRACT:
    The HCN 1-0 hyperfine lines have been observed toward 24 young stellar
objects (YSOs) of class 0 and I.  Their line shapes and velocity shifts 
with respect to the LSR velocity of the optically thin transition of 
N2H+ 1-0, are examined along with their relative optical depths, 
and compared with those of CS 2-1, H2CO 2,12-1,11, and 
HCO+ 4-3 & 3-2 transitions reported by Mardones et al. (1997) and 
Gregersen et al. (1997).
    It is found that all these molecular species do not always exhibit the 
same degrees of the line asymmetry or the velocity shift in a statistical 
sense, and that their correlation is better between HCN and CS than between 
HCN and H2CO.  The most opaque transition of HCN F=2-1 has about the 
same velocity shift as that of CS, in spite of the larger beam size of this 
study, which suggests that the HCN F=2-1 line may be more sensitive to the 
internal motion of YSOs than the CS line.  For many sources, a systematic 
change of the velocity shift is noted as one goes from F=0-1 to F=2-1.  
The monotonous decrease of the velocity is apparently more frequent.
    A detailed model of radiative transfer allowing line overlaps of HCN is
employed to L483 which shows a convincing signature of infall on the scale
of ~1 arcmin or ~0.1 pc.  It appears that the observed line 
is not compatible with the standard Shu (1977) model, but is fitted with
an augmentation of the density and the infall velocity, by factors of 6 and
0.5, respectively, and with an inclusion of a diffuse, static, turbulent,
and geometrically thick envelope.  BIMA observation will also be discussed.
