			   FINAL ANNOUNCEMENT

                           IAU SYMPOSIUM 190

                    NEW VIEWS OF THE MAGELLANIC CLOUDS

                    Victoria, Canada; 12 - 17 July 1998

                     http://cadcwww.hia.nrc.ca/iau190/

One month to go for IAU Symposium 190, New Views of the Magellanic Clouds,
a meeting which recognizes Dr. Sidney van den Bergh in the year of his
offical retirement from the National Research Council of Canada (NRC)!

The meetings are shaping up to be very exciting, as can be appreciated
by reviewing the current programme, registrants and abstracts listed on
our Web pages.  Registrations include experts from 22 countries
(Argentina, Australia, Canada, Chile, Czech Republic, France, Germany,
Greece, India, Italy. Japan, Latvia, The Netherlands, New Zealand,
Russia, Spain, South Africa, South Korea, Sweden, Taiwan, UK and USA).

Unless you have registered very recently, all registrants should have
received acknowledgement from the University of Victoria Conference
Services.  If not, and your name is not on the list of registrants given
on the web page please contact us as soon as possible at iau190@hia.nrc.ca.
You MUST register even if you have been fortunate enough to receive a
fee waiver from the IAU or CITA.  Follow the registration procedure outlined
on the web.

Please check the programme on the web to ensure that your poster paper
or invited talk is included.  Given the large number of poster papers, it 
will be necessary for us to have two poster sessions.  Posters listed in
the program for Monday and Tuesday, 13-14 July will be displayed on those
two days.  The remaining posters will be displayed from 15-17 July.
Poster displays have the standard 4' x 4' dimension and will be located
in the spacious foyer and hallway adjacent to the Lam Auditorium.

The Proceedings of the Symposium will be published by the Astronomical
Society of the Pacific.  More details will appear later on our web
site and will be given at the meeting.   The deadline for submission of
proceeding papers will be 30 September 1998.

Current housing information is also on the conference Web pages.

For meeting participants arriving at Victoria International Airport but
not renting a car, the AKAL Airport Shuttle provides transportation
between the airport and the University of Victoria Housing Office or
downtown Victoria.  The one-way fare is $13 (in Canadian dollars) per 
person and can be paid in cash or with a credit card.  For return 
transportion to the airport at the end of the conference you must reserve 
space on the shuttle at least one day in advance.  Sign-up sheets for this 
service will be provided at the conference registration desk.   For 
comparison, taxi service from the airport to campus or downtown Victoria
costs approximately $45.00.

Bus transportation is also available from Vancouver International Airport.
Fares to downtown Victoria (includes Tsawwassen-Swartz Bay Ferry fare)
are $30 one-way and $58 return.  

Three BC Transit bus routes (14 University, 4 Mt. Tolmie, 11 Uplands) provide 
regular transportation from downtown Victoria to the University of Victoria 
Campus.  One-way adult fares are $1.75 and route schedules and maps are 
available through links on our web page.

Additional detailed information about travel possibilities can be found
at our web site, as can a campus map.

Four major social functions are designed to foster renewal of old
acquaintances and the making of new ones: 

- The National Research Council is hosting an opening reception on
  Sunday, 12 July, 18:00 - 21:00. Regional and international food will
  be served, along with a no-host bar and live music from the Dominion
  Astrophysical Observatory's Resident String Quartet, The Sophysticats.

- On Monday morning, 13 July, shortly after the meeting opens, several
  Victorians will meet in a University cafe with companions of
  participants to offer advice on the wealth of activities available
  while in Victoria.

- The National Research Council invites meeting participants to visit the
  headquarters of the Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics at the Dominion
  Astrophysical Observatory (which Sidney van den Bergh directed from
  1977 through 1986). The staff will hold an open house that will allow
  participants to learn from staff about science other than that on
  the Magellanic Clouds, and to show participants the 1.8-m Plaskett
  Telescope (which celebrated its 80th anniversary as an active
  research facility on 6 May), the 1.2-m McKellar Telescope, the
  facilities where many instruments for the CFHT & Gemini (optical)
  and  JCMT (sub-mm) Telescopes are built, and the Canadian Astronomy
  Data Centre.

- A banquet featuring many West Coast delicacies, DUMKA (a professional
  quartet that specializes in lively European folk music), and some 
  light after dinner remarks from friends and former students of 
  Sidney van den Bergh.  
  
There is still room for everyone, but only persons who have registered
by Friday, 26 June are assured of being appropriately listed, having
poster papers accepted for presentation, etc.
