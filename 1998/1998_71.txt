To:         All ISO Observers
From:       M.F. Kessler

Subject:    Depletion of ISO's LHe Supply


I am sorry to have to inform you that ISO's supply of liquid helium ran out
on Wednesday 8 April; this is nearly one year more than specified and we
have been able to make a total of over 26000 observations, including two
visits to the Taurus/Orion region.  I attach for your information, the
announcement that was released to the Press on 9 April; this has also been
posted on our WWW server, 'isowww.estec.esa.nl'.

We will soon start a short phase of calibrations and technology tests with
the satellite.  At the end of this -in mid May- we plan to use the
remaining hydrazine to lower the perigee so that ISO will re-enter the
Earth's atmosphere some time in the first few decades of the next
century.  

Last September, the ISO OTAC approved a programme, led by Rens Waters NL, 
of 2.4 - 4 um (band 1) SWS observations to be carried out if (and whenever)
possible during this phase.  The goal is to extend the MK spectral
classification scheme to the infrared by obtaining 2.4 - 4 um scans at
full grating resolution (approx. 2000) of as many stars as is possible in
the time available. In effect, it is planned to fill gaps in the
technology test phase timeline with these observations.  As special
settings are needed, these observations will be carried out via the
'Calibration Uplink System'. 

In preparation, over the Easter weekend, the SWS team at VILSPA has been
monitoring the behaviour of its instrument, mainly by manual commanding. 
However, additionally for test purposes, half a dozen planned SWS
observations on bright targets in revolutions 876-879 were executed.  The
band 1 data look reasonable, thus, confirming the feasibility of the
spectral classification programme.  As of noon on 13 April, the SWS
temperature is around 20K.

When the technology test and calibration phase is over, the focus at
VILSPA will shift fully to the post operations phase.  We plan to
re-process all observations with a new pipeline (version 7), starting in
mid-May.  When this re-processing is complete, we plan to open the ISO
archive some time in early autumn.  Some 25% of the ISO data will be in
the public domain at that time and will be retrievable.

Further information will be posted as usual on the ISO WWW server at:
    isowww.estec.esa.nl

Best regards,
Martin F. Kessler,
ISO Project Scientist.

ISO completes its observations of the Universe by infrared light



ESA's Infrared Space Observatory, ISO, has ended its observational phase,
long after the expiry date of the end of May 1997 foreseen in the
specifications for the mission. Instead of the required 18 months, the
astronomers have been able to use ISO for more than 28 months, and as a
result have gathered a wealth of additional information about the
Universe. Altogether ISO has made over 26,000 observations of cosmic
objects.

At 07:00 on 8 April 1998, engineers at ESA's ground station at Villafranca
near Madrid reported that ISO's telescope was beginning to warm up, above
its nominal operating temperature close to absolute zero. This was the
sign that ISO had exhausted the superfluid helium used to achieve the very
low temperatures necessary for infrared astronomy.

Observations ceased at 23h07 when the temperature of the instruments had
risen above -269 degrees C. At that time, ISO was observing the galaxy NGC
1808 with the camera (ISOCAM) for Prof. J. Hough (UK). The astronomers
then handed ISO over to the engineering team for  check-outs and
decommissioning. The spacecraft will be switched off in about 28 days'
time.

Infrared rays come from cool places in the sky, and ISO would have  been
dazzled by its own heat unless its optical system were extremely cold. At
its launch in November 1995, ISO carried a supply of 2000 litres of
superfluid helium, which boils at -271 degrees C. Slow venting of the
helium into space maintained the low temperature of the optical system.

How did ISO achieve its extended life? Three months came from a prudent
safety margin in the engineering calculations of the rate of loss of
helium. Two months were the result of favourable circumstances in the
launch campaign at Kourou in French Guiana. During a technical check of
the Ariane 44P launcher, ISO's engineers seized the chance to recharge the
helium, and the quick launch that followed meant that the outer parts of
the cryogenic system of the spacecraft had little time to warm up in
Kourou's tropical climate.

Finally, the daily loss of helium turned out to be 17% less than expected,
at the lower end of a range of possibilities considered by the engineers.
That gave ISO an estimated five months of additional life.

The date for the helium to run out remained somewhat uncertain, and
astronomers and engineers have been alert to the possibility of its
exhaustion for the past few weeks. The huge bonus to astronomers, from
ISO's long operating life, is only one of their reasons to be grateful for
the highly successful engineering and operations of ISO. The pointing
accuracy of ISO's telescope was ten times better than required by the
specification, and its jitter was one-fifth of what would have been
considered tolerable. Smooth, well-planned operations were extended on a
daily basis by a US ground station supporting ESA's Villafranca station.

ISO was observing selected targets in the sky for 90-95% of the time
available.

Even in between the planned observations a "serendipity" programme 
with the ISOPHOT instrument charted cool objects as ISO slewed from one 
target to the next.

Although ISO's observations are now completed, astronomers will be
analysing them for years to come, assisted by a team of mission experts
who will continue their work at Villafranca and other centres worldwide
until 2001.

Commenting on the completion of ISO's observational phase, ESA's director
of science, Roger Bonnet, says: "We always knew that ISO's helium would
run out one day, and we can be grateful that it has lasted for so long.
This is a time for celebration, not sorrow, and I congratulate the
VILSPA, ESTEC and ESOC staff who have operated so efficiently the
spacecraft as well as European industry which developed such an excellent
mission and our scientists who built such an outstanding payload. I wish
European astronomers as well as their colleagues from the USA and Japan
to now fully exploit the image data acquired by ISO".
