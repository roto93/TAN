                       October 4 -- 8, 1999

                 Puerto de la Cruz, Tenerife (Spain)



                   ***** First Announcement *****



This is the first announcement for the 11th Cool Stars Workshop to be
held in the town of Puerto de la Cruz (Tenerife, Spain) on October 1999.
The meeting is organized by the Instituto de Astrofisica de Canarias
(IAC), which hosts the two international observatories located in the
Canary Islands (Roque de los Muchachos at La Palma and Teide at
Tenerife).


I. Rationale

The Cool Stars Workshops are designed to provide a regular forum where
members of the solar and stellar communities can gather to discuss new
observations and theoretical models and, in particular, to attempt to
correlate the very detailed observations we have for the Sun with the
vast, but less detailed database of observations of more distant stars.
Cool Stars 11 will continue that tradition. We expect this to be a very
lively meeting, with about 300 participants. The emphasis will be on
identifying the challenges and unsolved problems in the physics of
late-type stars for the future. Note that this will be the last Cool
Stars Workshop of the millennium and it will be a good opportunity to
review some of the fields frequently considered in these workshops.


II. Scientific Programming and Scheduling

The meeting will be divided into morning and afternoon sessions.

Five of these time slots will be arranged as plenary morning sessions
with a sequence of talks devoted to a particular topic. The five
selected topics are:

        * Advances in Solar Physics
        * The Formation of Stars and Planets
        * Chemical Abundances as Diagnostics of Stellar Structure
        * Unsolved Problems in Stellar Activity
        * Impact of Space Missions and Very Large telescopes on Cool
          Stars

Invited reviews, invited and contributed talks, and posters will be
presented. The organising committee will select contributions for oral
or poster presentation from the applications.

Two afternoon time slots will be arranged as parallel discussion
sessions. The spirit of the these discussion sessions will be the
same as for the last three Cool Stars Workshops, with a moderator to
organise the session and keep it moving, a panel of "experts" to
raise questions and suggest answers, and frequent opportunities for
contributions from the audience. During each time slot, there will
be two concurrent discussion sessions.

Two of the discussion topics will be:

        * Magnetic Fields in Cool Stars
        * Ages, Distances, and the Initial Mass Functions of Stellar
          Clusters

We invite the potential attendees of the meeting to propose topics to be
covered in the two remaining discussion sessions.

IV. Location

The meeting will take place in the conference center adjacent to the
Casino Taoro in Puerto de la Cruz. We expect most participants to stay
in the hotels close to the conference center. Puerto de la Cruz is a
seaside resort within a 30 minutes drive of La Laguna (University town 
hosting the IAC's headquarters) and Santa Cruz (largest city in Tenerife, 
population ~250,000), and only 20 minutes from the North airport.

Tenerife is regularly connected to 16 foreign airports and has direct
charter flights from/to more than 112 foreign cities. There are daily
flights between Tenerife and Madrid, and also direct connections with 
other Spanish and European cities. Daily flights are also available for
different American locations and Madrid, which are easily linked to 
Tenerife via Iberia or other Spanish regular airlines.


V. Schedule

This is the first announcement of the meeting. If you wish to receive
further announcements, please return the attached questionaire 
***BY E-MAIL***. The second announcement will be sent in February 1999. 
It will contain a preliminary scientific programme with the list
