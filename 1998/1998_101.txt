Abstract:
We present new near-infrared data and an analysis which indicates that
the ``Pistol Star'' is one of the most luminous stars known, adding
another test point for massive star formation and stellar evolution
theories.  We estimate an extinction of A_K = 3.2+/-0.5 using the
near-infrared colors of the star and surrounding stars in the young
Quintuplet cluster.  Using our wind/atmosphere code, we find two
families of models which fit the spectral energy distribution and
detailed line profiles. The lower luminosity models give L =
10^6.6+/-0.2 Lsun and Teff = 10^4.15+/-0.01 K, while the higher
luminosity models give L = 10^7.2+/-0.2 Lsun and Teff =
10^4.33+/-0.01 K; the error in luminosity assumes an uncertainty of
+/-0.5 in A_K, while the error in Teff is constrained by detailed
line modeling.  The models also reveal a helium enriched surface.  As
previously existing stellar evolution models do not extend to such
high luminosities, we employ new evolutionary tracks for very massive
stars to determine the initial mass and age of the Pistol Star, and
estimate M_initial = 200-250 Msun and an age of 1.7-2.1 Myrs.  The
inferred luminosity and temperature place the star in a sparsely
populated zone in the HR diagram where ``Luminous Blue Variables''
(LBVs) are often found.  This is consistent with our evolutionary
models which predict that the star is in an unstable evolutionary
stage. We interpret the star and its surrounding nebula as an LBV
which has recently ejected large amounts of material. Our K-band
speckle imaging data reveal the star to be single down to a projected
separation of 110 AU.

Abstract:
The Gamma Ray Imaging Spectrometer (GRIS) recently observed the
gamma-ray emission from the Galactic center region.  We have detected
the 1809 keV Galactic ^26Al emission at a significance level of 6.8
sigma but have found no evidence for emission at 1173 keV and 1332
keV, expected from the decay chain of the nucleosynthetic ^60Fe.  The
isotopic abundances and fluxes are derived for different source
distribution models.  The resulting abundances are between 2.6+/-0.4
and 4.5+/-0.7 M_o for ^26Al and a 2 sigma upper limit for ^60Fe
between 1.7 and 3.1 M_o.  The measured ^26Al emission flux is
significantly higher than that derived from the CGRO/COMPTEL 1.8 MeV
sky map.  This suggests that a fraction of the ^26Al emission may come
from extended sources with a low surface brightness that are invisible
to COMPTEL. We obtain a ^60Fe to ^26Al flux ratio 2 sigma upper limit
of 0.14, which is slightly lower than the 0.16 predicted from current
nucleosynthesis models assuming that SNII are the major contributors
to the galactic ^26Al.  Since the uncertainties in the predicted
fluxes are large (up to a factor of 2), our measurement is still
compatible with the theoretical expectations.
