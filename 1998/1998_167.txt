Dear TANists,

We are glad to have Prof. Tom J. Millar visiting ASIAA soon.  He is currently
the Head of the Physics Department at UMIST (University of Manchester Institute
of Science of Technology) and is mainly working in astrochemistry, both in
observation and modelling.  You can also check his homepage to get more
information about him:

During his visit from Sept. 6 to 20, the following colloqia are scheduled:

	Place: IAMS (Inst. of Atomic & Molecular Sceince), Academia Sinica,
	       at NTU campus
	Date:  Sep. 9
	Time:  3:00 - 4:00 pm
	Title: Modelling of molecular processes in interstellar cehmistry

	Place: ASIAA (Inst. of Astron. & Astrophys.), Academia Sinica,
	       at Nankang campus
	Date:  Sep. 11
	Time:  2:30 - 3:30 pm
	Title: Hot Molecular Cores

	Place: IAMS (Inst. of Atomic & Molecular Sceince), Academia Sinica,
	       at NTU campus
	Date:  Sep. 16
	Time:  3:00 - 4:00 pm
	Title: Interstellar Chemistry of Deuterium
	       -- Probing the origin of the Universe

	Place: ASIAA (Inst. of Astron. & Astrophys.), Academia Sinica,
	       at Nankang campus
	Date:  Sep. 18
	Time:  2:30 - 3:30 pm
