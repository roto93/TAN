Subject: Video Press Conference

To All Cfa Staff:

A  NASA  press conference to announce the discovery of a possible
planetary system developing around a nearby star will be held  in 
Washington, DC,  tomorrow,  Tuesday,  April 21, beginning at 11 am
EDT,  and can be viewed live,  via satellite, in the Phillips
Auditorium.  

The televised conference will feature Lee Hartmann of the CfA, as 
well as other members of the two independent teams of astronomers who 
used telescopes in Hawaii and Chile to image a disk of dust--or 
possibly proto-planets--around  the star HD 4796A.  

Other panelists will be:
  *  Dr. Michael Werner, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory/Caltech,
Pasadena, CA;
  *  Dr. David Koerner, JPL/University of Pennsylvania,
Philadelphia;
  *  Dr. Michael Jura, University of California, Los Angeles;
  and, 
  *  Dr. Ed Weiler, Director of NASA's Origins Program,
Washington, DC, panel moderator.

The conference will originate from NASA Headquarters 
Auditorium, 300 E St., S.W., Washington, DC, and will be carried live 
on "NASA TV," with two-way question-and-answer capability for 
reporters covering the event from participating NASA centers.   

CfA staffers who wish to watch the conference in Phillips Auditoirum
should arrive before 11.   [ A copy of the coordinated NOAO-NSF-CfA
press release, with images, will be available to staff and general
public at: http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/cfa/ep/pressrel/rayjay.html,
after 11 am tomorrow.]

For those staff with home satellite systems,  NASA Television 
is broadcast on  the GE2 satellite, which is located on Transponder 
9C, at 85 degrees West longitude, frequency 3880.0 Mhz, audio 6.8 
MHz.
