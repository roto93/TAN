Session 1:  Colloquium (2:30 - 3:30 pm)

            SPEAKER: Dr. Chen Lin-Wen (ASIAA)
	    TITLE:   "Through the Lockman hole: looking into the past"
            ABSTRACT:
The Lockman hole field has the lowest HI column density in the sky,
which provides a unique cosmological window for probing the distant
Universe, An overview on science of this field will be given, mostly
based on results published this year.  

There are mainly two (rather independent) lines of research: one is the
most important X-ray deep survey with ROSAT to study the origin of the
X-ray background, the other is to detect high  redshift star-forming
galaxies, particularly in the sub-mm regime.  For both X-ray and
sub-mm background studies, they are dealing with resolving the background
into faint sources, with a common technique of anaylising the confusion
limit of source detection. 

The talk will be concluded by (1) my project of using the Lockman hole
data to study the evolution of the X-ray Universe, and (2) a quick
estimate of what SMA can do in deep field science, among other competitors
in the market in the next few years. 


Session 2:  Journal Club (3:45 -- 4:15)

            SPEAKER: Dr. Wen Chi-Yi (ASIAA)
	    TITLE:   "Thermal Observations of Centaur 1997 CU26"
	              (1998, ApJL, 499, 103)
