Dear Juliane,

These are good suggestions.  I have another student, Sienny Shang,
whose difficulties with written and spoken English caused her a
lot of grief in her prelims and quals, and even to some extent
in her current writing of her thesis.  I'm not sure, however,
that a formal course on Language Profiency at the 100 level will
lead to a solution for the oral difficulty, although it may well
be very helpful for repairing writing deficiencies.

I talked with Sienny about this problem and she makes a good point.
She says that Chinese students (where she has the most experience)
in Physics do better than Chinese students in Astronomy, because of
the difference in testing culture.  Students in the PRC and Taiwan
are taught in the classical European physics tradition.  They are
at home with formal homework problems and written exams, and they
get a lot of practice becoming proficient in this milieu.  When
they come to the Physics Department, they do quite well because
this part of the culture remains the same.  In contrast, when they
come into astronomy, it is an alien culture.  The emphasis becomes
much more thinking quickly on your feet, on an intuitive understanding
of natural phenomenon, on order of magnitude arguments, and on
understanding how astronomical data is obtained and interpreted.
Each of these activities are helped by good verbal skills (which may be why
one of the best correlations with later success we find in entering
students is the VERBAL part of the GRE), and such skills (in English)are 
precisely what students from Asia lack.

The Department -- nay, the field -- needs to recognize this basic
disparity and do something about it, if we are to continue to
admit students from Asia and not to put them on an unlevel playing field.
Perhaps instituting a seminar course where they are forced on a frequent
basis to make oral presentations and answer questions from the floor
is the best solution to the pressing problem of developing good verbal
skills.

Best regards,
