Subject: Archival Pure Parallel Information

							28 January 1998

Colleagues: 

   As a result of the fact that there was a significant undersubscription
of parallel observation opportunites in the original Cycle 7 TAC
allocation, a community working group was formed to develop HST programs to
optimize the use of pure parallel observing opportunities, with the data
non-proprietary and placed immediately in the archive.  The recommendations
of this working group were accepted by the Director.  These archival pure
parallel programs are described in detail on the WWW at
http://archive.stsci.edu/hst/parallels, and will begin executing in
February 1998. 

   We want to draw your attention to the fact that although these data are
not yet resident in the HST archive, archival research funds can be
requested for their analysis in the extended Cycle 7 Call for Proposals for
Archival Research (deadline 27 February 1998; cf. http://www.
stsci.edu/ftp/proposers/cycle7_ar-ex/ar.html, for more information).  It is
difficult to predict precisely how much data will be obtained and available
in the archive at any time for these parallel program, however we expect to
obtain at least 

  11 hours per week of WFPC2 
  22 hours per week of STIS
  16 hours per week of NICMOS

pure parallel exposures.  These data will be distributed among the
different programs defined for each instrument. 

   Some of the more specific programs have relatively few opportunities to
schedule, and therefore users are encouraged to concentrate on the generic
pointing archival pure parallel programs at this time.  For example, for
the STIS there are generic programs defined for short, i.e., < 1 orbit,
opportunities and longer high galactic and low galactic pointings.  In
addition, there are specific pointing programs to observe in the Galactic
Bulge and in globular clusters.  It is much more difficult to predict when
data from these specific parallel programs will be available in the
archive, and users are advised to wait until the Cycle 8 Call for Proposals
(planned for release in June, with submission deadline in September 1998)
to see how much data have been obtained before proposing for archival
research funds for these specific pointing programs. 

   Due to the uncertain volume with which we will acquire these new
archival pure parallel datasets, archival funding may be delayed until a
significant portion of the data described in your AR funding proposal is
resident in the HST archive.  Quite separately, proposers should realize
that Archival Research funding for the Hubble Deep Field-South campaign,
currently planned for execution in October 1998, is not yet being solicited
in this Cycle 7 Extension for Archival Research, but will be considered in
Cycle 8.
