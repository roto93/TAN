Dear Colleague, 

please take note and if possible advertise this announcement for the 
LES HOUCHES summer school among your collaborators, post-docs and students :

        "TOPOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF LOW DIMENSIONAL SYSTEMS"
             Les Houches, France, July 7-31 1998


SCIENTIFIC PROGRAM :

The purpose of the school is to introduce young scientists to the 
study of quantum systems in low dimensions. In the past years, this 
field has been the subject of numerous theoretical and experimental 
works. Among the most notorious, let us mention, in condensed 
matter, the integer and fractional quantum Hall effects, quantum 
spin chains, polymers, mesoscopic systems in low dimensions. These 
topics require a wide range of modern theoretical methods, such as 
field theory, statistical mechanics, and topology. The quantum Hall 
effect will be a central topic; related subjects such as anyons,
one dimensional statistics, statistical mechanics of polymers,  will 
also be discussed. The school is open to advanced graduate students 
and young researchers. Attendance is limited to 50 students.

Main lectures: 

Introduction to Topological Numbers, D. J. Thouless, 
The Quantum Hall Effect, S. M. Girvin, 
Experimental Aspects of the Quantum Hall Effect, M. Shayegan
Edge States, M. P. A. Fisher,
Exact Properties in Quantum Impurity problems, H. Saleur, 
Anyons, Jan Myrheim,
Intermediate Statistics in d=1, A. Polychronakos,
Aspects of Chern-Simons Theory, G. Dunne,
Topological Statistical Mechanics of Polymers, B. Duplantier, 
Statistics of Knots and entangled Random Walks, S. Nechaev.

Additional lectures and seminars will be given by invited speakers
and by school attendants.
