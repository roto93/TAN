   International Square Kilometre Array Science Meeting
                  Calgary, Canada
                 20-22 July 1998

  We are planning a workshop to highlight the science opportunities
  available with a new future radio telescope, the Square Kilometre
  Array.  Over the past several years, discussions have been occurring in
  several countries about the next logical step in radio astronomy
  following the up-coming construction of large millimetre arrays.
  An initiative has emerged to develop a telescope to provide two
  orders of magnitude increase in sensitivity over existing
  facilities at metre to centimetre wavelengths. To achieve this
  goal will require a telescope with one square kilometre of
  collecting area - one hundred times more collecting area than
  the Very Large Array. The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) would
  probe the gaseous component of the early Universe, thereby
  addressing fundamental questions about the origin and evolution
  of the Universe. The SKA would complement planned facilities at
  other wavelengths, such as the Next Generation Space Telescope
  (NGST). HI, CO and continuum radiation would be observed from
  the interstellar media of most of the galaxies that NGST will
  discover in the infrared at large redshifts.

  In 1993 the International Union of Radio Science (URSI)
  established an international working group to explore the range
  of scientific problems to be addressed by the instrument,
  to discuss the technical specifications and general design
  considerations needed to maximise the scientific return of
  such a facility and to identify and, in so far possible, resolve
  the major technical challenges to the realisation of an affordable
  radio telescope with the required sensitivity.

  The next meeting of the URSI Large Telescope working group will
  take place in July in Calgary, Canada. The LTWG meeting will be
  held in association with a Square Kilometre Array Science
  Workshop in Calgary on July 20-22.  The location of the
  workshop, in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, is conducive
  to visionary thinking about radio astronomy for the next
  generation . The aim of the workshop is to discuss the
  scientific impact of the Square Kilometre Array from the solar
  system, to stars, the interstellar medium, galaxies, and
  cosmology.

  included detailed instrument specifications can be found at
