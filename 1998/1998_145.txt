Following is a job vacancy:

Assistant Scientist
NATIONAL RADIO ASTRONOMY OBSERVATORY
P.O. Box O
Socorro, NM 87801-0387

Attention: Miller Goss, Assistant Director 
Email: mgoss@nrao.edu

The NRAO, which runs the VLA and VLBA for its user community, is seeking
an experienced and talented individual to provide various types of
support to ensure the high level of success of these two instruments. 
The successful applicant will initially be involved in the testing and
calibration of the VLBA at high frequencies (43 and 86 Ghz).  He/she
will also be required to provide support to users and about 25% of the
applicant's time is expected to be devoted to astronomical research. 
This appointment is initially for a period of three years with the
possibility of extension.

The ideal candidate should be an active Ph.D. level astronomer with an
interest in interferometry.  This individual should have the ability to
work within a group environment and to interact with users
individually.  Some knowledge of the practical aspects of radio
astronomy is desirable.

Information about the NRAO is available on the WWW (www.nrao.edu).

Applicants should send a curriculum vitae, a letter with a description
of research interests, and arrange for three letters of reference to be
sent to the above address.

Applications received before September 1, 1998 will receive full
consideration.

The National Radio Astronomy Observatory is operated by Associated
Universities, Inc., under cooperative agreement with the National
Science Foundation, an equal opportunity employer (D/V/M/F).
