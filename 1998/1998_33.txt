Dear Colleague,


We are pleased to announce the workshop

		"HI in the Local Universe II"

to be held in Melbourne, Australia, 28-30 Sep 1998.  This is the second
in a series of workshops aimed at exploring the scientific issues
associated with the distribution of neutral hydrogen in the local
universe.  Particular emphasis will be on results from the Parkes
Multibeam survey of the southern sky in neutral hydrogen. 

More information on the workshop and how to register can be
found in our webpages at

http://astro.ph.unimelb.edu.au/hiconf/

Please bring this message to the attention of other colleagues who might
be interested.



The Local Organizing Committee,

Erwin de Blok, Virginia Kilborn, Mary Putman, Rachel Webster (Chair).
