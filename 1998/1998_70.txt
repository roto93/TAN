About Santa Barbara: The city of Santa Barbara, founded by the Spanish
in the 18th Century, is considered to be one of the jewels of the
California coast.  It lies approximately 100 miles northwest of Los
Angeles, nestled against the Santa Ynez Mountains and over-looking the
Pacific Ocean.  In July, the days are warm (70 degrees F) and the
nights are normally cool (50-60 degrees), with occasional morning fog.
Nearby are many excellent ocean beaches, lakes, forests, mountains
with varied hiking trails, and such man-made attractions as the Hearst
Castle, the flower fields of Lompoc, the Old World Danish Village of
Solvang, the Santa Barbara Mission, the Court House and other examples
of Spanish architecture. The Protostars and Planets IV conference will
be held at UCSB's large Corwin Pavilion at the recently completed
University Center, over-looking the picturesque lagoon at the southern
boundary of the campus, next to the ocean.


Some of the subjects to be covered at the meeting:

1. Molecular clouds, cloud cores, fragmentation and collapse.
2. Star-forming regions, star formation in clusters, the initial
mass function.
3. High- and low-mass star formation.
4. Young binaries and multiple stars.
5. Protostellar jets and outflows.
6. Kinematics and evolution of circumstellar envelopes and disks.
7. Assembly of particles in proto-planetary disks.
8. Planet formation, early solar system, formation of chondrules and CAIs.
9. Comets and the Kuiper Belt.
10. Disks around main-sequence stars 
11. Extrasolar planets and brown dwarfs.

     GENERAL INFORMATION AND DETAILS OF ACCOMMODATION AND TRAVEL


Housing Information for Protostars & Planets IV.

On-campus lodging:

We are pleased to invite Protostars & Planets IV attendees to reside
on the seaside campus of the University of California, Santa Barbara
(UCSB).  Residence Halls and Dining Facilities are located within a
5-10 minute walk from the session meeting rooms and from the Pacific
Ocean coastline.  Residence Hall accommodations are either single or
double occupancy.  We strongly recommend that reservations be made as
soon as possible.  Although we will try initially to reserve single
rooms for all those who request them, demand for campus accommodation
is likely to be high.  Later registrants may therefore be asked to
share rooms, but we point out that this will be accompanied by a
reduction in costs of about $100 per registrant.  We emphasize that
campus accommodation will be popular, so that very late registrants
will need to stay at local hotels (details below).  Early registration
is therefore doubly recommended.  (Please note: fire regulations
permit a maximum of two people in a Residence Hall room; we must ask
that families of more than two people reside either in a University
apartment or at one of the discount-rated hotels.)

Lodging includes beds made on arrival day and daily room service with
washcloth and towel change.  Restroom and shower facilities are
located on each floor.  You may wish to bring along shower shoes as
well as an alarm clock as our desk staff cannot provide a wake-up
service.  Phone service is available in each room.  You will need to
bring your own phone instrument in order to utilize this service.
Phone lines are for local and credit card calls only.  Should you
forget to bring a telephone with you, our bookstore will have some
available at a reduced cost for our summer conference attendees.  The
Service Desk of the Residence Hall will also take messages and post
daily.  If you would like to give out a number ahead of time where you
can be reached it is (805) 893-2469.

A computer lab is also available in the Residence Hall so that you can
access your e-mail.  Hours of availability will be posted outside the
lab.  Knowing the type of e-mail server you have and the proper
configuration parameters needed (e-mail address, userid, password,
server name or address) are all essential to accessing your e-mail
from the UCSB location.  The computer lab provides standard Internet
Services (Telnet, FTP, TN3207) and AOL.

The On-Campus Housing Plan includes seven nights lodging (Sunday
through Saturday night) and the following meals either in the dining
commons or as special events: Welcome Reception Sunday Evening;
breakfast, lunch and dinner Monday through Tuesday; breakfast and
lunch Wednesday; breakfast, lunch and dinner Thursday; breakfast and
lunch Friday and a beach BBQ in the evening; breakfast, lunch and
dinner Saturday; breakfast Sunday morning.

An Early Arrival Package is available for Saturday night, July 4.
This package includes lodging ONLY...NO MEALS.  Attendees are welcome
to purchase meals in our dining commons at the door on Saturday and
Sunday (breakfast: $5.80; lunch: $8.40; dinner: $10.85).  Please note:
the main On-Campus Housing Plan does NOT include meals until the
Sunday Evening Welcome Reception.

A limited number of off-campus (20 minute walk) student apartments are
available for occupancy by families with children (two bedrooms, four
single beds).  They are furnished and while perfectly adequate, are
not maintained to "hotel standards" as they are student-occupied nine
months out of the year.  These apartments DO NOT include meals or
parking.  Again, meals can be purchased at the Dining Commons.

Available hotels: Blocks of rooms have been reserved, at special
conference rates for the hotels listed below.  We encourage you to
make your reservations early as rooms that are not picked up by June 3
will be released.  You must identify yourself as a Protostars and
Planets IV Conference Attendee to receive the special conference rate.

Optional Bus Trip Into Santa Barbara: Wednesday, July 8, will feature
an "Afternoon and Evening in Santa Barbara."  Buses will depart from
campus and drop attendees off at two sites in Santa Barbara (the Santa
Barbara Wharf area as well as the downtown shopping areas).  These
buses will continue to operate throughout the day and evening, making
return trips back to campus.  We recommend that you purchase a ticket
in advance for this trip so that we can better judge the number of
attendees who are interested.  You can indicate this purchase on your
registration form (above).

Friday Night Beach BBQ: A BBQ is scheduled for Friday night (July 10)
at Goleta Beach (adjacent to the UCSB Campus).  Featured items will
include Mixed Greens with Garlic Croutons and Fresh Herb Vinaigrette,
California Cole Slaw and Red Potato Salad with Fresh Dill, Grilled
Cumin Rubbed Chicken, Sweet Corn on the Cob and Warm Corn Bread, Lemon
Cheesecake with Mixed Berries and a selection of domestic and imported
beers as well as local California wines.  This special event is
included in the On-campus lodging package; those staying in either a
University apartment or off-campus will need to purchase a ticket in
advance...there is an area on the registration form (above) for this
purchase.



Travel

By air: Most people traveling by air will initially land at Los
Angeles International Airport (LAX), which is about a 2.5-hour drive
from Santa Barbara.  From there, you have the option to either fly to
Santa Barbara, travel by road to Santa Barbara via the Santa Barbara
Airbus or rent a car and drive to Santa Barbara.  

Flying into Santa Barbara: A free UCSB Shuttle Bus will carry those
participants staying at the University from the Santa Barbara Airport
to their campus residence hall.  For transportation to campus please
call 893-2469 upon arrival at the Santa Barbara Airport.  At the end
of the conference, the UCSB Shuttle Bus will take on-campus
participants back to the Santa Barbara Airport for their departure.
Those staying in local hotels are responsible for their own
transportation from the Airport to their individual hotel; some hotels
provide this service so please check when reading the above hotel
descriptions.  If your hotel does not provide this service, you may
wish to try SuperRide Shuttle, (805) 683-9636, which offers a local
rate ranging from $9.00 - $18.00, depending on the location of your
destination site in Santa Barbara.  Reservations are strongly
recommended.  

Traveling by road from LAX to Santa Barbara: The Santa Barbara Airbus
provides several daily bus trips from the Los Angeles International
Airport to Santa Barbara; Phone: US/Canada (800) 423-1618; (805)
964-7759 for those calling outside the US/Canada area, or Fax: (805)
683-0307.  With 24-hour advance reservation, cost is $32/one way or
$60/round trip; all other reservations are $35/one way or $65/round
trip.  There are discounts available for parties of two or more as
well.  Reservations are strongly recommended.  Please remember that if
you will be residing on campus at UCSB and will be using the Santa
Barbara Airbus, make sure that your drop-off site is in Goleta.  That
way our UCSB Shuttle Bus will be able to pick you up and bring you to
campus.  You should call 893-2469 from the Santa Barbara Airbus
drop-off site to secure our UCSB Shuttle Bus.  At the end of the
conference, the UCSB Shuttle Bus will take on-campus participants back
to the Santa Barbara Airbus Goleta drop-off site for their departure.
Again, those staying in local hotels are responsible for their own
transportation from the Santa Barbara Airbus drop-off site to their
individual hotel.  


Personal Vehicle Arrival: UCSB is easily accessible from US 101.  If
arriving from the South, take the UCSB/Highway 217 exit and ask for
directions at the gate to the San Nicolas Residence Hall if you are
residing on campus.  If you are residing off campus and will be
driving to UCSB, please stop at the gate for directions.  If you are
arriving from the North, take the Storke Road/UCSB exit and drive
south (toward the ocean) to a "T" junction with El Colegio Road.  Turn
left onto El Colegio Road and ask for directions at the University
gate.

By Train: Santa Barbara is served by Amtrak Train Service.  The Amtrak
terminal is in downtown Santa Barbara.  From there, you may reach the
campus or your hotel by SuperRide Shuttle or taxi only.  Note: The
UCSB Campus Shuttle cannot pick you up from the train station if you
are residing on campus.

Parking: Parking permits are required on campus.  If you will be
driving onto campus and are staying in the Residence Hall at UCSB,
please identify yourself at the gate as a participant of Protostars &
Planets IV and you will receive a one-hour temporary permit.  When you
arrive at the Residence Hall please let the desk staff know that you
will be needing a long-term permit which you may use for the duration
of your stay (this is complimentary for those residing on campus).  If
you are not residing in the Residence Hall and will be driving to and
from campus daily, the gate can also give you a temporary permit and
you will need to purchase a permit for the duration of the conference
at registration.  If you wish, you can purchase a parking permit ahead
of time by indicating so on the registration form....your permit will
be included with your registration materials.  Parking citations are
issued for cars incorrectly parked or lacking permits.  Please note
that UCSB is a walking campus and parking is limited.  Your parking
assignment may not necessarily be close to the facilities you will be
using.


Useful Information:

Conference Support Funding: The Lunar and Planetary Institute
(Houston) will sponsor some conference participants.  We will be able
to cover part (not all) of the travel, registration and accommodation
fees for a small number of people who otherwise would not be able to
join our conference.  If you wish to be considered, please indicate so
on the registration form above, and please say why you cannot obtain
full funding from your own institution or local grant-awarding body.
Our funds will be extremely important to some people wishing to attend
the conference; please, therefore, do not request support if you
already have sufficient funding.


Recreation: The University Recreation Center is open Monday through
Saturday.  Equipment includes racquetball and squash courts, weight
training rooms and 3 swimming pools.  Consult with the Residence Hall
Desk Attendant for hours and fees.  Passes for the Recreation Center
will also be sold at Registration.

Campus smoking policy: UCSB prohibits smoking in its buildings.
Smoking will be allowed only in outdoor areas including breeze-ways
and patios.

Americans with Disabilities Act: UCSB Campus Conference Services
strongly supports the federal Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)
which prohibits discrimination against, and promotes public
accessibility for, those with disabilities.  In support of and
compliance with this Act, we ask that those requiring specific
equipment or services as an attendee of CVPR to indicate your needs on
the registration form.

Dress: Casual clothing is in order, with a sweater or light jacket
occasionally needed for the evenings.  UCSB is essentially a walking
campus, so be sure to wear comfortable walking shoes.
