      The EVN Program Committee wishes to draw the attention of VLBI
      observers to special observing opportunities with the EVN in 1998.


      Session 2 (May-June) will include some days of joint EVN+MERLIN  
      time at 1.6 GHz. This provides an array which combines a dense
      u,v coverage with high sensitivity at intermediate resolutions,
      ideal for imaging sources with complex structures on scales of
      15 - 500 mas. The deadline for submitting proposals for this is
      1st FEBRUARY 1998.


      A special EVN-only observing session at 6 GHz is planned for
      the November 1998 session. The antennas at Jodrell Bank, Onsala,
      Effelsberg, Medicina and Torun will be available for observing
      the spectral lines of METHANOL at 6.67 GHz and EXCITED-STATE OH 
      at 6.03 GHz. Interested observers are encouraged to submit  
      proposals for this unique observing opportunity.


      All the major EVN observatories can now record data in wideband-
      channel modes, using VLBA or MK4 terminals. GLOBAL observing
      together with the VLBA, with correlation at the VLBA correlator
      in Socorro, is thus possible using a range of mutually compatible
      VLBA/MK4 MODES, providing an array of up to 20 antennas. This
      is a very powerful observing tool, both for high dynamic range
      mapping, and for observing many sources in "snapshot" mode.


      The EVN  Call for Proposals, instructions for EVN and Global
      proposal submission, and a list of "OK_modes" for VLBA/MK4
      recording are available from the EVN WWW home page :
