1.  RESEARCH IN UNDERGRADUATE INSTITIUTIONS (RUI) 
    PROPOSAL DEADLINE

The 15 September 1998 deadline for all RUI proposals 
to the DIVISION OF ASTRONOMICAL SCIENCES (AST) was 
distributed at the June 1998 AAS meeting and announced
in the AAS Newsletter.  It is also listed on the AST web
page (http://www.nsf.gov/mps/ast/).   However, many 
prospective applicants appear to be unaware of this new
deadline, which is a change from previous years. In the 
past, AST RUI proposals were due on the date of the 
deadline of the AST disciplinary programs most related
to the proposed science.  Therefore, the AST RUI proposal
due date will be extended this year to provide a period 
of transition.  RUI proposals to AST will be accepted
through 15 October 1998.  AST plans to make the RUI 
proposal deadline in AST 15 October 1999 next year.
