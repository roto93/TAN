			 - CALL FOR PAPERS -
                           
Dear Colleague,

After a number of informal announcements, we are now pleased to
formally announce the upcoming Galactic Center workshop "The Central
Parsecs" to be held in Tucson, Arizona Sep. 7-11, 1998. As indicated
by the title, the workshop will be dedicated to an intensive
discussion of the processes seen in the innermost region of the Milky
Way. The workshop will be restricted to 60 participants with ample
time reserved for discussion and interaction. Proceedings will be
published in the ASP Conference Series and abstracts submitted for
the conference will be indexed by ADS.

The workshop is organized by the Galactic Center Newsletter and
jointly sponsored by the "Sonderforschungsbereich 328" in Heidelberg,
and Steward Observatory in Tucson Arizona.

The conference location is the Sheraton El Conquistador Resort in 
Tucson and the registration fee will be $250, which includes the 
cost for all meals, refreshments, a banquet, an excursion, and a 
copy of the conference proceedings. Some limited funds to sponsor 
younger scientists are expected to be available.

More detailed and up-to-date information on the workshop, such as
the motivation & format, program, location, travel, etc. is available
on the conference web-site at

		  http://www.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de/gc98

We encourage you to make frequent use of this resource and to let us 
know if any additional information needs to be posted to the web-site.



		       ABSTRACTS & REGISTRATION
                       ========================

Following the initial announcements in GCNEWS, we have already received
a number of papers and solicited a few invitations in order to build a
preliminary program. Further suggestions for papers are welcome
and should be submitted to the SOC at gc98@mpifr-bonn.mpg.de by

***************************Abstract Deadline**************************
