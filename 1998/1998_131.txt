BIMA: Call for Proposals

Current Proposal Deadline is 1998 July 20 (Monday)
          -- electronic submissions to be received by 11:59 pm CDT.
          open-call for 3 mm observing plus simultaneous
          in-house-only call for 1 mm observing.

Proposals being accepted to use the 10-element array
during the 4th quarter FALL98 and 1st quarter WINTER99.
Expected configurations are C, B, A and possibly D array (depending on the
number of requests).
Some form of dynamic scheduling will be used during these observing periods.

A limited amount of 1 mm time will be available when conditions allow.
PIs requesting 1 mm tracks in B or A array should be able to self-cal their
observations; please include that information on the coversheet (new version
1.7).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

PIs requesting a large number of tracks are to submit their proposals as
"Key" proposals.
PIs of Key proposals are normally from one of the three BIMA institutions.

Be sure to click on WHAT'S NEW? for further information re 1 mm receivers, H
array, and for the latest re scheduling procedures and changes to the
proposal forms.

If at all possible, please use the electronic submission process. Thank you.
