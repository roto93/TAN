Nora,
Please send the APS announcements and my message below to
people in your e-mail list.

Dear Colleagues,

If you plan to go one of the largest physics meeting ever, the APS
Atlanta meeting on March 20-26, please send in your abstracts before
the dealine listed in the APS announcements below and win a prize.

If you were not planning to go to the meeting, there is another 
attraction to change your mind. The Overseas Chinese Physics Association
and NCTS are planning a satelite meeting on 3/18-3/20 in Atlanta.
All of you are invited to attend and some of you will be our recommended
invited speakers. The final details will be sent to you in a few weeks 
when we receive final words on financial support. However, in order not to 
miss the deadline and prizes, we hope you will submit  your abstracts
in another week. In any case you can always withdraw your abstract
if you change your mind later. 

Good luck and wish you win the prize.

Best wishes,
TK Lee

RE: PRIZES for Early Abstract Submission

As you know, the Centennial Meeting will combine the usual March and 
April meetings into one meeting.  Between the deadline for the "March" 
program abstracts (November 13) and the deadline for the "April" 
program abstracts (December 4) we expect to receive approximately 
7,000 abstracts within a three week period.  

To encourage early abstract submission, those APS members who submit 
abstracts for the "March" program by Monday, November 9, and for the 
"April" program by Monday, November 30,  will be eligible to be 
included in a prize drawing as follows:

* one roundtrip airline ticket from home city/Atlanta/home city 
(domestic USA travel only on Delta or United) [one ticket to be 
awarded for the "March" early  deadline and one to be awarded for the 
early  "April" deadline]

* 2 tickets to the Gala at the Fernbank Museum of Natural History 
(Sunday, 3/21) [2 tickets per each early  abstract deadline]

* One copy of the new coffee table book Physics in the Twentieth 
Century [one per each early abstract deadline]

>From the names of those submitting members who submit by the 
respective early  deadlines (stated above), we will randomly select 
the names of prize winners. Only  abstract submitting   members are 
eligible for the drawings.  An abstract submitter  is the person 
whose name appears in that specific field on the abstract, not the 
person who e-mailed the abstract template.

Winners of both the "March" program prizes and the "April" program 
prizes will be announced on December 14.

We know physicists aren't gamblers, but the odds of winning aren't 
bad -  you risk nothing by submitting early, and by doing so you 
will greatly assist the APS staff in managing the very large number of 
abstracts we expect.

GOOD LUCK AND THANKS FOR YOUR SUPPORT!
