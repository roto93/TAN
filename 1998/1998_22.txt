If you receive an email entitled "JOIN THE CREW" DO NOT open it.
It will erase everything on your hard drive.
Forward this letter out to as many people as you can.

This is a new, very malicious virus and not many people know about it.
This
information was announced yesterday morning from IBM; please share it
with
everyone that might access the internet.  Once again, pass this along to
EVERYONE in your address book so that this may be stopped.

Also, do not open or even look at any mail that says "RETURNED OR UNABLE
TO
DELIVERY" This virus will attach itself to your computer components and
render them useless. Immediately delete any mail items that say this.

AOL has said that this is a very dangerous virus and that there is NO
remedy
for it at this time. Please practice cautionary measures and forward this
to
all your online friends ASAP.
