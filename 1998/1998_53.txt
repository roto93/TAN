SECOND ANNOUNCEMENT

An International Workshop on the Next Generation Space Telescope (NGST) 
will be held in 

Liege, Belgium, June 15-18, 1998

as the 34th Liege International Astrophysics Colloquium under the 
chairmanship of Prof. D. Reimers, Hamburg Observatory. The Workshop is 
co-sponsored by ESA, ESO, NASA, STScI and Belgian organizations. 

The main purpose of the Workshop is to offer the astronomical communities at
large a forum where they may discuss and better define the prime scientific
objectives of the NGST and its complementarity with other large space and
ground facilities as well as reviewing the technological challenges, with
particular emphasis on those areas where European industry can offer
innovative contributions. 

BACKGROUND

During 1996 and 1997, NASA, following the recommendation of the "HST and
beyond" report, has invested considerable effort in the study and definition
of a large aperture (8 metre class) near IR space telescope, now known as
the Next Generation Space Telescope, to study the Universe at high redshift 
(5 < z < 30) and in particular the formation and evolution of galaxies at 
that early epoch.

NGST now constitutes a major part of the NASA "Origins" programme and
is planned to be launched in the year 2007. In mid 1996, NASA formally 
invited ESA to cooperate in these studies. Since the advent of the NGST 
concept and the ensuing scientific and technical feasibility studies carried 
out by NASA (see "NGST - Visiting a Time When Galaxies Were Young", June 1997,
Ed. P. Stockman), European astronomers have applied considerable pressure on 
ESA to participate in these studies and to consider a substantial European
involvement in NGST. 

Following the recommendations of a specially appointed NGST Task Group, 
ESA is now starting, in coordination with NASA, a number of studies on the
NGST
mission, its telescope and its instrumentation (see the "invitation for
a letter of interest" at URL http://ecf.hq.eso.org/ngst/Letter.pdf). The 
task group also recommended that an NGST workshop should be organized in 
Europe during 1998.

THE WORKSHOP

The Workshop will consist of invited talks and posters. All papers will 
be published in the Proceedings.

The programme will include: 

o  reviews of the current NGST concept and capabilities
o  status reports from the NASA and ESA NGST studies
o  early formation of stars, galaxies, and quasars
o  sub-mm observation of high-z galaxies
o  structure and dynamics of galaxies at z>2
o  distant supernovae
o  gravitational lensing
o  stellar populations in the nearby universe
o  extra-solar planets and young stars
o  instrument concepts for NGST
o  light-weight mirror technologies
o  orbit and mission concepts for NGST
