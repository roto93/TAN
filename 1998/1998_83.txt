Subject: A Catalog of 2118 Compact Radio Sources in the Northern Sky

23 April 1998

Dear Colleague,

      This message announces the availability of "A Catalog of 2118
Compact Radio Sources in the Northern Sky".

      The catalog of 2118 compact radio sources was derived from the
Jodrell Bank - VLA Astrometric Survey (JVAS) of flat-spectrum sources
(Patnaik et al. 1992, mnras, 254, 655; Browne et al. 1998, mnras, 293,
257; Wilkinson et al., mnras, submitted).  Each compact VLA source (a)
has a peak flux density at 8.4 GHz >= 50 mJy at a resolution of 200
milliarcsec; (b) contains 80% or more of the total source flux
density; and (c) has a position known to an rms accuracy of 12-55
milliarcsec.  The 2118 sources are uniformly distributed in the
northern sky at Galactic latitudes |b| >= 2.5 degrees.

      Although these sources are primarily intended for use as phase
calibrators for the Jodrell Bank MERLIN, they will also be suitable as
phase calibrators for the NRAO VLA and can be considered as candidate
phase calibrators for VLBI arrays (Peck & Beasley 1998, IAU Colloquium
164, 155) and the NRAO MMA (Holdaway, Owen & Rupen 1994, MMA Memo
No. 123).  Furthermore, compact radio sources close to the Galactic
plane can be used to probe the interstellar medium, through studies of
scintillation, angular broadening, Faraday rotation, and both
molecular and atomic absorption.  Compact radio sources are also
useful as navigation aids for spacecraft missions to Solar System
bodies.  Finally, masing conditions in cometary comas can be examined
by observing compact radio sources during occultation events.

      The catalog of 2118 compact radio sources is available via
anonymous ftp from host ftp.aoc.nrao.edu; cd to directory /pub and get
file sources.jvas.  The file can be read by the NRAO VLBI scheduling
program SCHED.
      
Yours sincerely,
J.M. Wrobel for the JVAS team
