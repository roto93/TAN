>Scientific Programme 
>--------------------
>
>The International Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory INTEGRAL is ESA's 
>gamma-ray mission (in collaboration with Russia and NASA) of the long term 
>space science programme `Horizon 2000'.
>INTEGRAL - using high-resolution gamma-ray spectroscopy, coded aperture fine 
>imaging with concurrent X-ray and optical source monitoring - will be 
>launched in April 2001. The observatory will be operated for two to possibly 
>five years. The majority of observing time will be given to the scientific 
>user community through a single peer review process.
>
>The main goals of this 3rd INTEGRAL workshop `The Extreme
>Universe' will be to discuss recent progress in hard X-ray and 
>gamma-ray astronomy on compact objects and to put these results in a broader 
>perspective of astrophysics in general. Furthermore this workshop will
provide
>the opportunity to also discuss latest scientific results compatible with all
>INTEGRAL scientific objectives.
>
>The status of the INTEGRAL mission, instruments and plans for the observing
>programme with INTEGRAL will also be presented.
>
>
>This third INTEGRAL workshop builds upon the results of the
>earlier ones held in 1993 and 1996:
>
>1st INTEGRAL workshop `The Multi-Wavelength Approach to Gamma-Ray Astronomy' 
>Les Diablerets, Switzerland, 1993. 
>Proceedings: ApJ Suppl.Ser. Vol. 92, Number 2, pp. 325 - 698 (June 1994).
>
>2nd INTEGRAL workshop `The Transparent Universe' St Malo, France, 1996.
>Proceedings: ESA SP-382 (March 1997)
>
>
>It is planned to cover the following topics by invited papers, 
>contributed papers and posters: 
>
>(1) Compact variable sources (Black hole candidates, neutron stars,
>Novae and Supernovae, superluminal and radio jet sources)
>
>(2) Nucleosynthesis and diffuse gamma-ray emission
>
>(3) AGN, Seyfert galaxies and Blazars
>
>(4) Normal galaxies and clusters of galaxies
>
>(5) Surveys and high energy background radiation
>
>(6) Gamma-ray bursts and soft gamma-ray repeaters 
>
>The final programme will be made available in July 1998 and it will also be 
>accessible on the WWW.
