Based on the detection of C\,IV absorption in five LMC stars observed with the
{\it Goddard High-Resolution Spectrograph} on the {\it Hubble Space Telescope}
we present the first unambiguous evidence that C$^{+3}$ exists in the Large
Magellanic Cloud (LMC) away from regions where it could have been locally
produced. We can exclude that this C$^{+3}$ is associated with hot early-type
stars or active regions. Significant differences between the H$\alpha$ and
C$^{+3}$ velocities toward our probes indicate that the H$^+$ and C$^{+3}$ are
not co-spatial. Large column density variations show that the distribution of
C$^{+3}$ is not uniform. The properties of the LMC C\,IV lines are similar but
not identical to those found for the Milky Way: 45\,km/s vs 73\,km/s for the
average FWHM, 8--12$\times$10$^{13}$\,cm$^{-2}$\ vs
9--16$\times$10$^{13}$\,cm$^{-2}$ for the average column density. The H$\alpha$
vs C\,IV velocity differences and the similarity of the properties of the
LMC and Milky Way C\,IV absorption suggest that at least some of the C$^{+3}$ in
the LMC is in a hot corona and that it has been produced by processes similar to
those in the Milky Way. Our results show the feasibility of detecting
high-ionization absorption in faint LMC stars, but more observations will be
necessary before we can understand the distribution and properties of 10$^5$\,K
gas in the LMC.

The detailed radial velocity field of the N105 H{\sc ii} region in the Large
Magellanic Cloud has been obtained for the H$\alpha $ and [O{\sc iii}]5007
lines with a spatial sampling of $9"$ and a spectral one of 16 and 7 km
s$^{-1}$ respectively. The line profiles present complex splittings and
broadening in several places. The peculiar velocity field and
morphology indicate that N105 contains 4 bubble-shaped nebulae and two
bright distinct quasi-spherical H{\sc ii} regions, more
or less coeval, embedded inside another one large shell nebula.
They are essentially formed by the action of the stellar winds of
exciting stars, probably
born deep inside their parental cloud. This result is
deduced from the energy input inside the ionized gas by the stellar
winds of early type stars and from dynamical simulations combining
the effects of stellar winds with those of high-density gradients inside
the neutral gas. The size and the morphology of the H{\sc ii} region are
conditioned by the depth inside the natal cloud; the observed dynamic
timescale of the H{\sc ii} region starts at the moment of blow-out of the
molecular cloud.

The kinematics of the field agrees with the expected issues of the 
stellar content and of the molecular studies. The position of masers and 
of a infrared source inside N105 and the structure of this nebula 
suggest that such an IR source may be the consequence of star formation 
triggered by the surrounding wind pressure due to the progenitors of the 
presently evolved stars.\\

Was star formation in the OB associations, LH~51 and LH~54, triggered
by the growth of the superbubble DEM~192?  To examine this possibility,
we investigate the stellar contents and star formation history, and
model the evolution of the shell.  H-R diagrams constructed from
$UBV$ photometry and spectral classifications indicate highly coeval
star formation, with the entire
massive star population having an age of $\lta$ 2--3 Myr.  However,
LH~54 is constrained to an age of $\sim$ 3 Myr by the presence of a WR
star, and the IMF for LH~51 suggests a lower-mass limit implying
an age of 1--2 Myr.  There is no evidence of an earlier stellar
population to create the superbubble, but the modeled shell kinematics
are consistent with an origin due to the strongest stellar winds of LH~54.
It might therefore be possible that LH~54 created the superbubble, which in
turn may have triggered the creation of LH~51.  Within the errors, the
spatial distribution of stellar masses and IMF appear uniform within
the associations.
 
We reinvestigate
the estimates for stellar wind power $L_w(t)$, during the H-burning
phase, and note that revised mass-loss rates yield a significantly
different form for $L_w(t)$, and may affect stellar evolution
timescales.  We also model superbubble expansion into an ambient
medium with a sudden, discontinuous drop in density, and find that
this can easily reproduce the anomalously high shell expansion
velocities seen in many superbubbles.

Intercomparisons of groundbased IR continuum and H$_2$ images
with HST/WFPC2 images of the 30~Doradus Nebula reveal detailed
structural
relationships, which provide new information about current star
formation there. Numerous stellar IR sources have
been discovered in or near the bright nebular filaments west and
northeast of R136; their locations are intimately connected
with the nebular microstructures, as well as with early O stars in dense
nebular knots whose optical spectral
classifications indicate extreme youth.
The H$_2$ emission predominates in the dust
clouds beyond the bright nebulosity and IR sources,
with respect to R136.  The emerging
picture suggests that a new stellar generation is being
triggered by the energetic activity of the massive central
cluster in the remanent interstellar material around
its periphery.  Comparison with the more evolved,
giant shell H~{\sc ii} region N11 in the LMC indicates a
generic relationship to 30~Doradus, and that ``two-stage
starbursts'' may be characteristic of massive star formation on
this scale.

The origin of a regular, 600 pc-long arc of young stars and clusters in
the Constellation III region of the Large Magellanic Cloud is
considered. The circular form of this arc suggests that the prestellar
gas was uniformly swept up by a central source of pressure. In the
center of the arc are six $\sim30$ My old A-type supergiant stars and
a Cepheid variable of similar age, which may be related to the source 
of this pressure. We calculate the expansion of a bubble around a cluster 
of this age, and show that
it could have triggered the formation of the arc at the right time and
place. Surrounding the central old stars and extending well outside
the young arc is the LMC4 superbubble and giant HI shell. We show how
this superbubble and shell could have formed by the continued expansion
of the 15 My old cavity, following star formation in the arc and the
associated new pressures. The age sequence proposed here was not evident
in the recent observations by Olsen et al.\ and Braun et al.\ because the
first generation stars in the center of the LMC superbubble are
relatively faint and scarce
compared to the more substantial population of stars
less than 15 My old that formed throughout the region in a second
generation. These considerations lead to an examination of the origin of
the LMC4/Constellation III region and other large rings in the LMC and
other galaxies. Their size and circularity could be the result of low          
galactic shear and a thick disk, with several generations of star formation
in their interiors now too faint to see.

The average age difference between pairs of star clusters in the Large
Magellanic Clouds increases with their separation as the $\sim0.35$ power.
This suggests that star formation is hierarchical in
space and time.  Small regions form stars quickly and large regions,
which often contain the small regions, form stars over a longer
period.   A similar result found previously for Cepheid variables
is statistically less certain than the cluster result.

We report on HST observations of six candidate old globular clusters in the
Large Magellanic Cloud: NGC 1754, NGC 1835, NGC 1898, NGC 1916, NGC 2005 and 
NGC 2019. Deep exposures with the F555W and F814W filters provide us with 
colour-magnitude diagrams that reach to an apparent magnitude in $V$ of 
$\sim$25, well below the main sequence turnoff. These particular clusters are 
involved with significantly high LMC field star densities and care was taken 
to subtract the field stars from the cluster colour-magnitude diagrams 
accurately. In two cases there is significant variable reddening across at 
least part of the image, but only for NGC 1916 does the differential reddening 
preclude accurate measurements of the CMD characteristics.  The morphologies 
of the colour-magnitude diagrams match well those of Galactic globular 
clusters of similar metallicity.  All six have well-developed horizontal 
branches, while four clearly have stars on both sides of the RR Lyrae gap.    
The abundances obtained from measurements of the height of the red giant 
branch above the level of the horizontal branch are 0.3 dex higher, on 
average, than previously measured spectroscopic abundances.  Detailed
comparisons with Galactic globular cluster fiducials show that all six 
clusters are old objects, very similar in age to classical Galactic globulars 
such as M5, with little age spread among the clusters.  This result is 
consistent with ages derived by measuring the magnitude difference between 
the horizontal branch and main sequence turnoff.  We also find a similar 
chronology by comparing the horizontal branch morphologies and abundances 
with the horizontal branch evolutionary tracks of Lee, Demarque, \& Zinn 
(1994).  Our results imply that the LMC formed at the same time as the 
Milky Way Galaxy.

The $I$-band brightness $M_I$ of clump stars is a possible distance
indicator for stellar populations. Investigations have shown that
$M_I$ is almost insensitive to the $(V-I)$ colour within the
clump. Based on this, it was assumed that $M_I$ was insensitive to age
and composition of the stellar population and therefore an ideal
standard candle, which could be calibrated with local clump stars,
whose absolute brightness is known from {\em Hipparcos}
parallaxes. This resulted in a distance to the LMC about 15\% shorter
than usually determined.

In the present paper we show that with a population synthesis approach
we can reproduce the constancy of $M_I$ with colour for the local {\sl
Hipparcos} clump sample. Nevertheless, $M_I$ is not a constant among
different populations, but depends on metallicity. As a result, the
determined distance modulus to the LMC of $18.28\pm0.18$ mag is in
better agreement with standard values. This resolves, at least
partially, the controversial result obtained by the assumption of a
universal value for $M_I$.

Particularly remarkable is our prediction that stars slightly heavier
than the maximum mass for developing degenerate He cores, $M_{\rm Hef}$,
should define a secondary, clumpy structure, about 0.3~mag below the
bluest extremity of the red clump. Both features are well separated in
the $M_I$ vs.\ $V-I$ diagram of metal-rich stellar populations. Indeed,
this secondary clump can be clearly identified in the {\em Hipparcos}
database of stars with reliable $I$ photometry and parallax errors
smaller than 10\%.  Since the stars in this feature should represent a
narrow range of masses, their mass determination, e.g.\ by the use of
binary systems, can provide information about the efficiency of
convective overshooting from stellar cores.

Our investigation demonstrates that the RGB clump cannot be used as a
distance indicator without proper knowledge and modelling of the
population under investigation. In addition, there remain unsolved
problems in the models, such as correct bolometric corrections and
colour transformations.

The LM method -- Luri et al.\ (1996) --, designed to exploit the Hipparcos 
data to obtain luminosity calibrations, is applied to derive 
luminosity calibrations for RR Lyrae and classical Cepheids. From these 
calibrations the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is 
estimated. The distance moduli provided by the two calibrations 
are in good agreement, giving a value of $\sim 18.3^m$, while several
previous calibrations using Hipparcos data provided inconsistent results 
between both types of stars. This result suggest that the Hubble constant 
should have a value of $H_0 \sim 79$ km s$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-1}$.  \\

We analyze the mean luminosity of three samples of field RRab~Lyr  stars
observed in the course of the OGLE microlensing experiment: 73 stars 
from the Galactic bulge and 110 and 128 stars from selected fields in
the LMC  and SMC, respectively. The fields are the same as in the recent
distance  determination to the Magellanic Clouds with the red clump
stars method by Udalski {\it et al} (1998). We determine  the relative
distance scale $d_{GB}^{RR}:d_{LMC}^{RR}:d_{SMC}^{RR}$ equal to: 
($0.194\pm0.010):1.00:(1.30\pm0.08$). 

We calibrate our RR~Lyr distance scale with the recent calibration of
Gould and Popowski (1998) based on statistical parallaxes. We obtain
the  following distance moduli to the Galactic bulge, LMC and SMC: ${m-
M=14.53{\pm}0.15}$, ${m-M=18.09{\pm}0.16}$ and ${m-M=18.66\pm0.16}$~mag.

We use the RR~Lyr mean {\it V}-band luminosity at the Galactic bulge
metallicity as the  reference brightness and analyze the mean, {\it
I}-band luminosity of the red  clump stars in objects with different
ages and metallicities. We add to our analysis the metal poor Carina
dwarf galaxy which contains old RR~Lyr stars and intermediate age red
clump population. We find a weak dependence of the mean red clump
brightness on metallicity and we calibrate its zero point with the
nearby local red clump stars measured by Hipparcos: $M^{\rm
RC}_I=(0.09\pm0.03)\times{\rm [Fe/H]^{\rm RC}}-0.23\pm0.03$. Our revised
red clump distance moduli to the Galactic bulge, LMC and SMC are ${m-
M=14.53\pm0.06}$, ${m-M=18.13\pm0.07}$ and ${m-M=18.63\pm0.07}$~mag,
respectively. The distance modulus to the Carina galaxy is
${m-M=19.84\pm0.07}$~mag. Excellent  agreement of RR~Lyr and red clump
distances  which have independent absolute calibrations confirms the
short distance scale to the LMC.

Hypersonic bipolar outflows are a
ubiquitous phenomena associated with both young and highly evolved
stars. Observations of Planetary Nebulae, the nebulae surrounding
Luminous Blue Variables such as $\eta$ Carinae, Wolf Rayet bubbles, the
circumstellar environment of SN 1987A and Young Stellar Objects all
revealed high velocity outflows with a wide range of shapes. In this
paper I review the current state of our theoretical understanding of
these outflows.

Beginning with Planetary Nebulae considerable progress has been made in
understanding bipolar outflows as the result of stellar winds
interacting with the circumstellar environment.  In what has been
called the "Generalized Wind Blown Bubble" (GWBB) scenario, a fast
tenuous wind from the central star expands into an ambient medium with
an aspherical (toroidal) density distribution.  Inertial gradients due
to the gaseous torus quickly lead to an expanding prolate or bipolar
shell of swept-up gas bounded by strong shock waves.  Numerical
simulations of the GWBB scenario show a surprisingly rich variety of
gasdynamical behavior, allowing models to recover many of the observed
properties of stellar bipolar outflows including the development of
collimated supersonic jets.

In this paper we review the physics behind the GWBB scenario in detail
and consider its strengths and weakness.  Alternative models involving
MHD processes are also examined.  Applications of these models to each
of the principle classes of stellar bipolar outflow (YSO, PNe, LBV,
SN87A) are then reviewed.  Outstanding issues in the study of bipolar
outflows are considered as are those questions which arise when the
outflows are viewed as a single class of phenomena occurring across the
HR diagram.

A stellar wind model for a magnetic rotating star is presented.  We use
the semi-analytic Wind Compression model that predicts the
2-dimensional geometry of outflows from rotating stars and consider the
addition of a magnetic field.  In the limit of weak magnetic fields,
such that the fields are unimportant in accelerating the flow, the Wind
Compression model can be used to predict the magnetic field
distribution throughout the wind, which is shown to follow the mass
flux distribution.  A compression of field lines near the equator
results as the flow of material from higher latitudes brings magnetic
flux toward that region.  As examples, Wind Compression models with
magnetic fields (``WCField'' models) are computed for both a Wolf-Rayet
star and a Red Supergiant star.  In both cases an order of magnitude
enhancement of the equatorial magnetic field can result within a few
stellar radii for stellar rotation rates around 20\% of critical.  Such
enhancements could have consequences for explaining (1) non-thermal
emission observed from some Wolf-Rayet winds and (2) the ring
structures observed in the ejecta of SN1987A.

We expect the evolution of massive stars to be strongly influenced by
mass-loss, and hence be sensitive to metallicity.  It should be possible
to test this ``Conti scenario'' be comparing the populations of
evolved massive stars among the Local Group galaxies, but such investigations 
have been hampered by incompleteness. In Paper~I we
presented results of a new survey for red supergiants (RSGs) in selected
regions of the Local Group galaxies
M~33, M~31, and NGC~6822.  In the present paper, we survey eight fields
in M~33 for Wolf-Rayet stars (WRs), using interference
filter imaging with a CCD to select candidates.  Follow-up spectroscopy
is used to confirm 22 newly found WR stars, all of WN type.  We establish
that our survey would readily detect WRs as weak-lined as any known, and
we conclude that our survey is essentially complete.  This survey confirms
suspicions that the previous photographic surveys were only 50\% complete
for WN-type WRs and allows us to combine the data with equally complete
samples on other Local Group galaxies.  We find that the relative number of
WC and WN type WRs correlates extremely well with metallicity, varying by
a factor of 3 with galactocentric distance within the plane of M~33, and
continuing the trend to lower and higher metallicity galaxies. The WC/WN
ratio within 3~kpc of the sun is slightly above this trend, and we argue
that WN stars are underrepresented in this sample.  The WC/WN
ratio is anomalously high in IC~10, given its low metallicity, and we
demonstrate that this is not due to selection effects, but is likely
due to IC~10's current status as a starburst system.  We examine the
spectral properties of WC stars within these galaxies, confirming the
previously reported trends that the spectral lines are stronger and broader
in regions of lower metallicity.  We suggest that the different
WC spectral subclasses do not primarily indicate different physical properties
for these stars, but rather are simply a reflection of the effect that
the initial metal abundances has had on the stellar wind structure.
Finally, we compare the luminous RSGs with WRs in these galaxies.  We find
that there is a very strong correlation of the relative numbers of RSGs and
WRs with metallicity, in the sense predicted by Maeder, Lequeux, \& Azzopardi:
at lower metallicities the fraction of luminous ($M_{bol}<-7$)
RSGs is higher, with a
factor of 6 change within the disk of M~33
($\Delta$log (O/H)=0.35~dex), and a factor of $\sim10$ change from M~31
(or the inner portions of M~33) to NGC~6822 ($\Delta$log (O/H)=0.5~dex).
This is easily
explained by the Conti scenario in terms of massive stars spending 
proportionately less of their He-burning lifetimes as RSGs rather than WRs
at higher metallicities and hence higher mass-loss rates.  Finally, we note
that the presence of luminous RSGs and WRs stars is extremely well correlated
for the OB associations in M~31 and M~33: where one finds one, one finds the
other.  To the extent that an association is strictly coeval, this argues that
some stars of 15$\cal M_\odot$ and above indeed do go through both a RSG
and WR stage.  The presence of WR stars of both WN and WC type in the same
associations as luminous RSGs further suggests that some WCs, at least,
have gone through the RSG phase.  We include an appendix providing a complete
catalog of confirmed WR stars in Local Group galaxies
beyond the Magellanic Clouds.\\

We  propose to search for MACHOs by observing 
EAGLE (Extremely Amplified Gravitational LEnsing) events
of a majority of dim stars. This search is independent  
of the usual one.
For the  detection limit of EAGLE ($\sim$ 20 mag),  
$\sim 100 ~f ~(\tau^{\rm LMC} / 3 \times 10^{-7})$ 
$(100 ~{\rm days} / \langle \bar t \rangle)$ 
EAGLE events/y are expected to result from all 
the dim stars in LMC. Here $\tau^{\rm LMC}$ and 
$\langle \bar t \rangle$ 
are the optical depth and the average duration of microlensing events, 
respectively, while  $f ~(0 < f < 1)$ is a parameter depending on 
the unknown stellar luminosity function. 
The observed mean duration of EAGLE events  also depends on the 
luminosity function and is $0.01 \sim 0.4$ 
times the usual duration of microlensing events, which corresponds to
 $1 \sim 30$ days. The follow-up observation using larger 
telescopes  may enable us to determine the impact parameter 
and the true duration of the event. If $f$ is determined 
by another independent method, we can 
also determine $\tau^{\rm LMC}$. Even if $f$ is  undetermined, 
the detection of  EAGLE events strongly suggest that MACHOs 
are not due to variable 
source stars, since EAGLE events are due to 
the dim main-sequence stars. 
Although for the SMC, the event rate is smaller 
by a factor of $\sim 7$, it is still a substantial number 
($\sim 13 ~f ~(\tau^{\rm SMC} / 3 \times 10^{-7}$) ($100 ~{\rm days} 
/ \langle \bar t \rangle)$ events/y).

How did the Sgr dwarf galaxy manage to come within 16 kpc of the
Galactic center while other satellite systems of the Galaxy are all
orbiting beyond 50 kpc?  The consideration that its 10-Gyr-old
``fluffy'' core should have long been dissolved by the strong and
frequent tidal shocks by the Galactic disc and halo forces us to
question the assumption that it was born on the present orbit.  A
scenario that Sgr was deflected to its current orbit by the Magellanic
Clouds after a rendezvous on the north Galactic pole $2-3$ Gyrs ago is
examined.  It is shown that both the sense and the speed of
circulations of Sgr and the LMC around the Galaxy are fixed by timing
the collision, and fit direct observations of the proper motions
remarkably well.  Furthermore the collision is very sensitive to the
potential of the Galaxy between 20-100 kpc, hence provides an
unconventional test of the existence and distribution of dark matter
of the Galaxy.  The apparent agreement of our predictions with
previous data leads us to propose that the two orthogonal polar
circles, traced by a dozen or so Galactic halo dwarf galaxies and
globular clusters (LMC-SMC-Magellanic Stream-Draco-Ursa Minor along $l
\approx 270^o$ and M54-Ter 7-Ter 8-Arp 2-NGC 2419-Pal 15 along $l
\approx 0^o$), are streams of tidal relics from two ancient galaxies
which were captured on two intersecting polar rosette orbits by the
Galaxy.  We contrast our model with observations, and provide
interpretations of the microlensing towards the LMC and the star
formation history of the objects on the two polar circles.
