Requesting contributions to the 

	S T A N D A R D   S T A R S   N E W S L E T T E R   # 2 4

Presumably "no news is good news", but since the last Newsletter of
October 1997 I haven't heard from anyone with abstracts, etc., about
Standard Stars.  Something must have been happening, so do let me know, 
and thus your colleagues also.

Please send me a contribution by Saturday, March 7, 1998.  This may be an
abstract of a forthcoming or recent paper, some notice of your ongoing
work and its progress, some data (perhaps in not-too-long tables), a
comment or opinion.  All aspects of "standards" are welcome, including
radial velocities and abundances, besides the usual spectral, photometric,
and polarization topics.  Do also send me announcements of forthcoming
meetings.

Contributions by e-mail in ascii or latex format (see latex template for
abstracts below) would be the most helpful to me, your editor, since I
shall continue to make this an electronic newsletter to individuals and
most libraries, with hardcopy only to those on our mailing list who don't
have latex or WWW facilities.  I can accommodate figures, whether in
Postscript or in hardcopy (which I shall scan). 

NB. CONTRIBUTIONS BY THE SEVENTH OF MARCH, PLEASE.  I shall publish
shortly after whatever I have received by then.  So, I look forward to
hearing from you soon, and, in anticipation, thank you!
