Researchers in recent decades have witnessed the emergence=20
of the quantum transport into a key phenomena for probing=20
the physics of systems or devices that involve conductors,=20
semiconductors, or superconductors. The establishment of the
weak localization and the electron-electron interaction effects=20
in disordered conductors has demonstrated unequivocally that
the phase coherenceof charge carriers can lead to significant=20
and intriguing physical consequences. With the recent maturity=20
of the nanotechnology, and the eventual appreciation of the phase
coherent features, or the mesoscopic features, in nanostructures,=20
many new physics have been proposed or observed. These include=20
ballistic transport, Aharonov-Bohm oscillations, coulomb blockade,
single-electron effects, photon effects, phonon effects,
interaction effects, effects of Andreev reflections in=20
superconductors, mesoscopic capacitors, persistent
current in rings, dephasing, decoherence etc. These phenomena,=20
or ideas, besides their potential importance for technological
applications, are worth exploring on their own rights because=20
they provide valuable opportunities for deepening our understanding=20
of quantum mechanics through direct experimental tests. The purpose=20
of this school is to help bring the current issues and the future
trend in the field of the quantum transport into focus, both
experimentally and theoretically, and to foster joint research=20
efforts between research groups, both locally and internationally.
