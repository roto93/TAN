Subject: Dwarf Tales, the Newsletter for the Dwarf Galaxy enthusiasts

Dear Colleagues,

It is my pleasure to announce ``Dwarf Tales'', a Newsletter dedicated
to Dwarf Galaxy research. The effort of editing this newsletter will
be shared with Eva Grebel.

The Newsletter, as currently planned, will cover all aspects of dwarf
galaxy research, observational as well as theoretical studies, stellar
content, ISM, dynamics, formation and evolution, and galaxies at low
and high redshift.  It will contain abstracts of submitted and
accepted papers, abstracts of conference contributions, thesis
abstracts, conference announcements, job advertisements, and general
news and information. It will be sent to subscribers in LaTeX format.

It will exclude the Magellanic Clouds which have already their own
Newsletter, MCNews, for which Eva is editor as well (see for more
information http://www.astro.uiuc.edu/mcnews/MCNews.html).

The dwarf galaxy newsletter has its home at the University of
Guanajuato, Mexico (thanks to the efforts of Eva!) at:

	http://www.astro.ugto.mx/~dwarfs/

The latest version of Dwarf Tales will be posted there, as LaTeX and
PostScript files. As this page evolves, more information and links
will be added. A European and a US mirror site have also been
established. First time users, please consult the Mexican HomePage for
links to the mirrors.  Subscriptions will be administered by me. If
you wish to subscribe to the dwarf galaxy newsletter, communicate a
change of address or wish to be removed from the master mailing list,
please send e-mail to

	dwarfs@astro.ugto.mx

Unless you inform me of the contrary, I will assume that everyone to
whom this e-mail has been sent DOES wish to be subscribed to Dwarf
Tales. Eva and I merged several mailing lists and it is quite possible
that some entries are inappropriate. In that case, please forgive the
intrusion and let me know, so I can remove your entry. Also, if you
receive this e-mail twice, please let me know to which address you
prefer I send info to. For those of you who have subscribed within the
last few days, there is of course no need for a reply.

Let me take this opportunity to thank those of you to whom I sent a
questionnaire and who responded so promptly (i.e., a subset of this
mailing list). Your feedback has been very valuable. After carefully
considering your comments, I decided to decline the offer by Kluwer to
edit a (text)book on dwarf galaxies. Support was lukewarm, at
best. Many of you agreed that there is a need for a graduate level
book on this topic. Arguments against focussed on the cost of Kluwer
books and the expected flood of conference proceedings of this year's
crop of meetings on the topic. Moreover, some of the ``obvious''
contributors to a book just have, or are in the process of writing
review articles.

Regarding my question on issuing a Newsletter, opinions were virtually
unanimous that this would be a highly useful thing to do. So, I guess
I'm stuck with it now!

I should like to encourage all of you to e-mail to

	dwarfs@astro.ugto.mx 

abstracts of your papers and any news or information which you
consider of interest to the dwarf community. A very simple LaTeX
template can be found on the Dwarf Tales HomePage. Contributions are
welcome at any time. The first issue of Dwarf Tales is planned for
31st March 1998. A frequency for mailing Newsletters has not been
established yet and will depend upon demand for it. I look forward to
your reactions.


With kind regards,

Elias Brinks
