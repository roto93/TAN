RESEARCH PROGRAMMER
Pablo Research Group/NSF PACI Alliance
Department of Computer Science
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign

We  are  seeking  a  research programmer/technical liaison for the Data and
Collaboration   Enabling   Technology   Team   of  the  NSF  PACI  National
Computational  Science  Alliance  (the  Alliance).   This position involves
working  with  the members of the enabling technology team to assist in the
deployment  of  high-end  storage and distributed collaboration software to
users  in  the  national high performance computing community. In addition,
the  liaison  will assist with administrative tasks such as report writing,
scheduling of meetings, and demonstration preparation.

The Alliance Data and Collaboration Enabling Technology Team is composed of
researchers  in  academic  groups, national laboratories, and supercomputer
centers throughout the country.  Professor Dan Reed is the team leader, and
his  Pablo  research  group  is  one  of  the  team  members.  Although the
technical  liaison  will  be  located  in  the  Pablo  group,  his  or  her
responsibility  is  to  facilitate technology transfer among all members of
enabling technology team.

The   ideal  candidate  would  enjoy  working  with  internationally  known
researchers  and  the latest high-performance computing and virtual reality
tools.  Enthusiasm, technical competence, willingness to travel, ability to
learn  new  skills and attention to detail are critical for success in this
position.  Communication  skills, both oral and written, and the ability to
work independently are of the utmost importance.

The  minimum  requirements are a bachelor's degree in computer science or a
related  scientific  field  and  at  least  two  years  of UNIX/NT software
development  experience.  In  addition,  experiences  with high-performance
parallel systems and large software projects are highly desired.

Further  information  about  the  Alliance  and  the Data and Collaboration
Enabling    Technology   Team   and   its   members   can   be   found   at
http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/alliance.   For  details  about  Professor  Reed
