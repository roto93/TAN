1.  RENEWAL REMINDER

By now all members should have received their renewal
invoices for 1999 membership and information about how 
to order the Centennial Commemorative volume.  In order 
to ensure uninterrupted service of AAS publications
please send renewal payments by 1 December 1998.

The pre-publication offer and special price for the
Centennial volume requires that orders be received by 
the AAS by 1 December 1998.

2.  UNDERGRADUATE RECEPTION IN AUSTIN

A surprising and gratifying number of undergraduates 
now attend AAS Meetings, many to give posters or short 
talks.  Tuesday, 5 January 1999, 6-7pm there is a free 
reception especially for undergraduates.  It gives 
them a chance to meet each other and to compare notes.  
AAS Officers welcome the students and to say a bit 
about the organization of the AAS and of the meeting 
itself.  An "astronomer in the news" is invited to 
say a few words.  The reception is a good occasion 
for the students and for their faculty advisors 
(it is a useful place to talk with prospective 
graduate students).

Please urge undergraduates who will attend the 
Austin Meeting to come to the Undergraduate Reception.  
If you bring a student to an AAS Meeting, please join 
them at the reception.  It is important for planning 
purposes to know roughly how many will attend each 
reception.  Faculty and students should notify 
Diana Alexander (diana@aas.org) if they plan to attend.

_________________________________________________________
3.  COUNCIL COMMENT FORM AVAILABLE

A web form on which a member may submit comments to 
the AAS Council is now available at 

http://www.aas.org/forms/councilbox.html  

Messages received in an interval between Council meetings 
will be transmitted to the Council with the materials for 
these meetings.  They may also be distributed to relevant 
committees or individuals for action or response prior to
the Council meeting.

Anonymous submissions will not be accepted.

5.  RELEASE OF HUBBLE DEEP FIELD-SOUTH DATASET ON 
    23 NOVEMBER 1998 
    --Robert Williams and Henry Ferguson, STScI/Baltimore 

In October 1998 177 orbits of HST imaging and spectroscopy 
were devoted to three adjacent fields plus flanking fields 
in the southern Continuous Viewing Zone in an HDF-S observing 
program similar to the original northern HDF. The HDF-S 
differs from the HDF-N in having (1) simultaneous
observations with three of the major HST instruments 
(WFPC2, STIS, and NICMOS) in parallel observing modes, 
leading to deep images of three separate fields, and
(2) the inclusion of a z_em=2.2 quasar in the line of sight 
for the STIS field. The HDF-S observations consist of WFPC2 
images in U, B, V, and I; a deep STIS image of the field 
surrounding the quasar; spectroscopy of the quasar with STIS 
from 1150-3560 A; and imaging of an adjacent field with NIC3 
in the J, H, and K  bands.

On 23 November 1998 at 3:00 pm EST the entire HDF-S dataset, 
consisting of both raw and pipeline-processed data, will be 
made publicly available from the HST Archive.  At the same time, 
fully reduced data (co-added images and extracted spectra), 
along with a description of the data reduction, will be 
posted on the HDF-S website at

6.  EUVE EPISODE 7 CALL FOR OBSERVING PROPOSALS
    Proposals Due: 4 December 1998

The Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer (EUVE) Observatory at 
the University of California, Berkeley (UCB) has issued 
a call for EUVE observing proposals for Episode 7 for 
observations to be scheduled March 1999 through March 2000. 
Proposals are due midnight PST Friday, 4 December 1998. 

EUVE is a NASA Explorer-class satellite mission devoted
entirely to observations in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) 
wavelength range from 70 to 760 Angstrom.  EUVE has 
carried out an all-sky survey in four photometric EUV 
bandpasses, detecting over 1000 new EUV sources. Through 
a GO program over 400 sources have been observed 
spectroscopically.

Time during Episode 7 will be made available to the
astrophysics community through a peer-review process.  
It is expected that this will be the last EUVE call for 
proposals.  Episode 7 will include a dedicated AXAF-EUVE 
cross calibration program as well as a program of 
coordinated scientific observations between AXAF and EUVE.  
AXAF-EUVE coordinated observations proposals were solicited 
earlier at 
http://www.cea.berkeley.edu/~science/html/EUVE_AXAFcall98.html
(deadline 9 November 1998). Observers requesting 
coordinatedEUVE time with AXAF programs must have submitted 
their proposals by the 9 November deadline and should not 
submit or resubmit them in response to this Episode 7 Call 
for Proposals.

For Episode 7, the EUVE Science Advisory Board is
encouraging the submission and scheduling of large observing 
programs with long exposure blocks (900 ksecs or longer). 
Smaller observing programs will still be considered on a 
time-availability basis, but the bulk of the Episode 
observing time will be awarded to larger observing proposals.

Proposals are being accepted through the Center for EUV
Astrophysics' Web-based proposal submission system at

http://www.cea.berkeley.edu/~science/html/EUVE_call98.html.
