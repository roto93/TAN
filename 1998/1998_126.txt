Graduate Forum, will be held 29-30 June 1998 at the Key Bridge
Marriott Hotel in Arlington VA.  This forum will feature promising 
practices in graduate education in the United States and alternative 
strategies for successfully implementing such practices.  It is one 
of a number of NSF supported initiatives intended to improve data and 
information about science and engineering graduate education in the 
United States.  Dr. Bordogna will be one of the opening speakers at 
the event, presenting an NSF overview.

Space at the Forum is limited to 300 participants. A general
registration fee of $100 (waived for students) is being charged to

4.  Space Interferometry Mission

NASA Research Announcement NRA 98-OSS-07 is released to 
solicit proposals for investigations regarding the Space 
Interferometry Mission (SIM).  This NRA solicits proposals for 
supporting basic research, analysis, and technology whose 
objectives are construction of the SIM reference grid, and
other long lead-time science investigations.  Astrometrically 
stable grid objects have positions reproducible to 
4 microarcseconds, once proper motion and parallax are taken 
into account.  The deadline for proposals in response to this 
NRA is 28 July 1998.

Further information about the program may be obtained from the 
Program Scientist, Dr. Harley Thronson (harley.thronson@hq.nasa.gov), 
or at the NASA OSS home page, at:
	http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/oss/research.htm

5.  Correction to June Newsletter Article

The last sentence of the, "Astronomers in the Commercial 
Sector" June Newsletter article was accidently deleted.
The last paragraph should have read:

"How does industry recruit new employees?  Industry is constantly
searching for candidates with the highest possible qualifications.  
Over the last 3 years, RSTX filled approximately 400 positions per year.  
Of these, approximately 26% were from employee referrals, 14% from outside 
referrals, 20% from internal transfers, 12% from print advertising, 9% 
from the Internet, 5% from re-hires, 3% from campus recruiting, 3% from 
job fairs and the remainder from a variety of sources. These statistics 
show that "networking" is by far the leading way to find employment in 
industry. Consequently, it is important to cultivate and maintain relationships with industrial scientists and to discuss your qualifications and career 
goals with them.  Second, the Internet is becoming competitive with print 
advertising and far more desirable from the company's perspective because 
of its low cost and immediacy. Furthermore, this form of recruitment is 
bound to grow.  So check the WEB sites of companies you are interested 
in frequently, since openings can come and go very quickly."
