Dear TANists,

There are good news these days:  Dr. K.-Y. Fred Lo got elected as an
Academician of the Academia Sinica; TAN is now two years old and there 
are over 150 subscribers, also we have just redesigned our TAN web page.

Now comes the bad news: we just lost one faithful member of TAN, Dr. John
Wang. We will all miss you, John.

Yi-Jehng

I am sorry to inform you that John Wang died over the weekend. He was
hiking in the Colorado Rockies and apparently lost the trail and fell
down a steep slope. I am sure that we all feel the loss of John and that
our sympathies go out to his family. As soon as there are any arrangements
for a memorial service, I will let you know.
		John Trasco
