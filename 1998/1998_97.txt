1.  AAS San Diego Meeting, 7-11 June 1998

Dr. Edwin Goldin and Ms. Susan Stringer of the AIP will present 
a special session on Job Hunting Skills, on Sunday, 7 June.  
This is a limited-attendance session to assure personalized 
attention for the participants.  Interested members should see 
the meeting program for details.  The deadline for reserving
attendance is 15 May.  Requests received after that date will be
accomodated on a space-available basis.

Upcoming Deadlines:
        Late papers                       6 May 1998, 9:00pm ET
        Hotel registration               15 May 1998
        Early Meeting registration       15 May 1998
        Job Hunting Skills Workshop reg. 15 May 1998

2.  South Pole Observing Opportunity

The Antarctic Submillimeter Telescope and Remote Observatory 
(AST/RO) invites proposals for use of the 1.7m telescope during 
the current Austral winter season (now through October 1998).  
Proposals may be submitted by any qualified astronomer and will 
be evaluated based on scientific merit.  Scheduled observations 
will be carried out by the AST/RO winterover scientist in residence 
at South Pole (who will be considered a scientific collaborator 
on the observations).  SIS receivers at 460-492 GHz and 230 GHz 
will be available, along with two acousto-optical spectrometers 
(AOS) with 1.07 MHz resolution and 1.1 GHz bandwith, and one AOS 
with 44 kHz resolution and 64 MHz bandwidth.  Proposed observations 
should take into account the instrumental capability of the AST/RO 
telescope; most observations at present are in the 492 GHz [CI] 
line or the 460 GHz J=4-3 CO line at low velocities.  Proposals 
submitted last year will be considered for scheduling early in 
the season.  New proposals sent to the following address before 
1 June 1998 will be evaluated by the AST/RO Telescope Allocation 
Committee for scheduling later in the season:  Dr. Adair P. Lane, 
AST/RO Project Manager, Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, 
60 Garden Street, MS-78, Cambridge, MA 02138 (or email proposal to:  
adair@cfa.harvard.edu).  Further information about AST/RO may be 
found at our Web site at 

	http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/~adair/AST_RO.

3.  Expanded Research Opportunity: The Search for 
    Extrasolar Planets Origins of Solar Systems Program, NASA

A substantial augmentation to the NASA Origins of Solar 
Systems Research Program will occur in FY99, with the new 
funds being explicitly limited to the support of ground-based 
searches for extrasolar planets.  Researchers interested in 
employing a wide range of ground-based search techniques 
(e.g., radial velocity, astrometry, photometry, microlensing)
are encouraged to apply for support. For information, see the 
website:

	http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/oss/nra/98-oss-03/

Note that even though Notices of Intent to propose were due 
on 6 April, because of this late-breaking announcement, NOI 
will be accepted past the deadline. However, the deadline for 
submission of proposals on 5 June 1998 remains firm.

4. Ultraviolet-Optical Space Astronomy Beyond HST
   5-7 August 1998 - Boulder, CO
   Contact: uvconf@casa.colorado.edu
   WWW: http://casa.colorado.edu/~uvconf/
 
A conference to discuss ultraviolet-optical space 
astronomy in the post-Hubble Space Telescope era, 
ranging from small missions to large-aperture telescopes. 

Early registration and abstract submission deadline is 
20 June 1998.

5.  Space Day '98

The Embrace Space campaign which is designed to encourage 
youth to share in the adventure of space and to nurture 
their love of science, math and technology has named 
May 21st Space Day '98.
