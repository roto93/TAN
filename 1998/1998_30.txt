INTRODUCTION:

Seven years have passed since the last IAU Symposium on the Magellanic
Clouds (MCs) was held in Sydney, Australia.  During this time, HST, ROSAT, 
ASCA, ISO, ATCA, ESO-SEST, and other observing and computing facilities 
became available.  These facilities allow us to study the MCs with 
unprecedented resolution and sensitivity.  Consequently, significant advances 
in MC studies were made in recent years.  Moreover, the VLT and Gemini South 
will soon be available.  Another IAU Symposium on the MCs is overdue!

In anticipation of Dr. Sidney van den Bergh's retirement in 1998, the
Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics and the Department of Physics and Astronomy
of the University of Victoria are pleased to co-sponsor the meeting 
"New Views of the Magellanic Clouds." Approved by the International
Astronomical Union as Symposium 190, the meeting will be held on the campus 
of the University of Victoria between 12 and 17 July, 1998.

The Proceedings of the Symposium will be published by the Astronomical
Society of the Pacific and are included as part of the registration fee.

A tentative timetable of important dates is given below:

		(http://astrowww.phys.uvic.ca/prvs/prvs.html)

	Atomic Spectra and Oscillator Strengths
		(http://WWW.UVCS.UVIC.CA/conferce/asos6/)

	The 1998 General Assembly of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada
		(http://victoria.tc.ca/~rasc/ga98/)

=============================================================================

SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE:

The Magellanic Clouds (MCs) provide an excellent laboratory to study
astrophysical processes because of their proximity, nearly face-on
viewing angle, and small internal and foreground extinction.  They are
the only galaxies for which it is possible to observe individual stars
and interstellar structures in great detail for the entire system.

The last IAU Symposium on the MCs was held in Sydney, Australia, in
1990.  Since that meeting significant advances have been made in many
areas as a result of new instrumentation, such as the Hubble Space
Telescope, the ROSAT and ASCA X-ray satellites, the UV Imaging
Telescope and ORFEUS-Spas shuttle missions, the IR Space Observatory,
the Australia Telescope Compact Array, the Swedish-ESO Submillimeter
Telescope, and large-format CCD and IR array detectors at major
southern observatories.

These new instruments have made possible large-scale surveys of
different phases of the ISM and of the stars in the MCs.  Examples
include the ROSAT surveys of the hot (10^6 K) ISM, the Curtis Schmidt
emission-line survey of the warm (10^4 K) ISM, the ATCA HI survey of
the neutral atomic ISM, the MACHO and EROS surveys of variable stars,
and the Scanning-CCD broad-band survey of stars.

These new instruments provide us with an opportunity to probe 
physical parameters/properties that were previously inaccessible.  
Consequently, the scientific frontier has been pushed to an 
unprecedented realm.

For the ISM, the ROSAT and ASCA satellites enable the determination 
of temperatures and abundances of the hot (10^6-10^7 K) ISM, HST UV 
spectroscopy shows the existence and physical conditions of 10^5 K 
gas, and ATCA reveals the HI distribution at 1' resolution.  It is 
now possible not only to study the physical conditions of individual 
structures, such as SNRs and supershells, but also to investigate 
comprehensively the multi-phase structure and evolution of the ISM 
over the entire galaxy.

For stars, the HST allows stellar populations to be studied with
higher spatial resolution so that the basic cluster characteristics
such as age, metallicity, and the IMF can be deduced with greater
accuracy.  With the large format detectors on ground-based telescopes,
studies involving millions of field stars have allowed the star
formation histories of the Clouds to be delineated in much greater
detail.  Recent space-based and ground-based high-resolution
spectroscopic studies of stars have revealed new insights about their
fundamental properties, mass loss, winds, and chemical evolution.
These findings supplement the improved grids of stellar evolutionary
models and model atmospheres that became available in the past years.

New views of the MCs are beginning to emerge from these recent
observations and theories.  It is thus an opportune time to hold an
international meeting on studies of the MCs.  It is our wish to
organize the meeting to emphasize the following topics:

(1) review recent advances in studies of stellar and interstellar 
    components of the MCs
(2) emphasize the interplay between the stellar and interstellar 
    components in the evolution of the MCs
(3) examine the detailed physical and dynamical structures, stellar 
    populations, and star formation histories of the MCs, so that
    this knowledge can be used as foundations to understand the 
    Galaxy as well as more distant galaxies
(4) plan future work utilizing the forthcoming IR/UV/X-ray satellite
    facilities and large ground-based telescopes

=============================================================================

PRELIMINARY PROGRAM:

Note: The SOC is actively working on the program. Our web site will be 
updated as that material becomes available.  The program is being structured 
so as to allow ample time for discussion and for poster viewing.  Special 
efforts to incorporate the poster papers into the program are being planned.

The general areas we expect to include are:

 1. Recent observations of stars and the ISM of the Magellanic Clouds.
 2. The physical properties and structure of the multiple-phase ISM.
 3. Interactions between stars/OB association/clusters and the ISM.
 4. Stellar evolution - observations vs theoretical models.
 5. Stellar systems - IMFs, abundances, ages, dynamics, populations.
 6. Star formation history and evolution of the Magellanic Clouds.
 7. The global structure of the Magellanic Clouds - populations,
    distributions of matter, and dynamics.
 8. The Distance to the Magellanic Clouds.
 9. Connections to other Magellanic irregulars and the distant universe.

The scientific program of the meeting will consist of invited reviews and 
contributed talks that are of general interest.  Other contributions will 
be presented in posters.  Ample time will be reserved for discussion and 
poster viewing.

VENUE:

The meeting will be held on the campus of the University of Victoria, which 
is located in suburban Victoria.  All scientific presentations will be in 
the David Lam Auditorium (MacLaurin 144).  Posters and coffee breaks will be 
in the spacious foyer and hallway adjacent to the Lam Auditorium.

Accommodation details can be found below. The meeting date coincides with 
high season in Victoria, so accommodation arrangements should be made well 
in advance of arrival.

Victoria is the capital of British Columbia and, with a metropolitan 
population of approximately 300,000, is the second-largest city in the 
province.  The city is situated on the Strait of Juan de Fuca near the 
Pacific Coast, and provides easy access to many scenic National, Provincial
and City parks in both Canada and the U.S. All are accessible by car (and 
possibly a ferry ride) within a day. They include the Pacific Rim National 
Park and Strathcona Provincial Park on Vancouver Island, Garibaldi Provincial 
Park north of Vancouver, and the Olympic National Park, Cascades National Park
and Mount Rainier National Park in Washington State, as well as numerous 
State Parks and resorts along the coasts of Washington and Oregon.  Temperate 
rain forests, mountains, glaciers and vibrant aboriginal cultures are only 
part of the sights available to visitors. Family members accompanying 
participants will find much to do in Victoria!

Temperatures in July typically range from a high of about 25 C to a low of 
11 C. Probability of rain is low, except during international conferences.  
To be prepared, bring along light rain gear and layered clothing so that you 
are ready for anything.

Links to many web pages that will let you explore just a few of the sights 
in and around Victoria, British Columbia, and the Pacific Northwest are
available on our web page: http://cadcwww.hia.nrc.ca/iau190/.

=============================================================================

TRAVEL AND MISCELLANEOUS INFORMATION:

Getting to Victoria:

Frequent short flights connect Victoria International Airport to both 
Seattle (SeaTac) and Vancouver International Airports.  Non-stop flights 
are also available from Calgary, Alberta.  Victoria's airport is about a 
25 minute taxi ride from the University or downtown.

An alternative, more leisurely route would be by rental car or motorcoach
and the B.C. Ferry from Tsewwassen (south of Vancouver, Canada) to Swartz Bay 
(north of Victoria); the trip from SeaTac to downtown Victoria requires about 
five hours, while travel time from Vancouver's Airport to downtown Victoria 
is approximately three hours.  Other routes include Port Angeles, WA to 
Victoria on the Coho Ferry, direct service between Seattle and Victoria 
harbours via the high-speed Victoria Clipper catamaran (foot passengers only),
or the Victoria Ferry Ltd. car ferry, and the Washington State Ferry from 
Anacortes, WA, to Sidney, BC, just north of Victoria.

Visa and Passport requirements:

Most visitors to Canada will require a passport.  Participants are also 
advised to check with their local Canadian consulate or their travel agent 
regarding current visa requirements to enter Canada. 

Medical Insurance:

All participants are strongly recommended to check their medical insurance 
for coverage during their stay in Canada.  The LOC will not accept liability 
for sickness or accidents.
 
Travel Support:

The IAU and the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics (CITA) have 
provided us with grants for travel support to assist those who otherwise 
cannot attend the conference due to financial constraints.  Generally only 
partial support for the travel can be offered.  If you want to apply for 
such assistance please fill out the appropriate form below, or on our
web page.

your receipts and submit the proper forms, and you will be able to obtain a
refund of the GST. GST rebate forms and information brochures will be
available at the conference registration desk. Provincial Sales Tax (PST 7%) 
is applicable on most retail sales and is not refundable.

Daycare:

There is no childcare service on the University of Victoria campus for 
children accompanying delegates to the conference.

Athletics and Recreation:

Delegates are invited to take advantage of the athletic and recreational
facilities on the University of Victoria campus. Chip trails surround UVic 
and are excellent for walking and jogging. An exercise companion is advisable.
Within walking distance is a sandy beach and playground for children.
The McKinnon Building and the UVic Gordon Head Complex provide an extensive
range of recreational facilities and services. The McKinnon Building
includes a gymnasium, dance studio, weight training room, 25m L-shaped
pool, squash courts, fitness testing area, running track, playing fields
and change and shower facilities. Racquets are available for rent. A day pass
is $4.00. Proof of conference attendance is required (your conference
registration receipt).  The UVic Gordon Head Complex includes a fieldhouse, 
gymnasium, fitness/weight center, hydra-gym, 25m outdoor pool, courts 
(squash, racquetball & badminton), an ice rink as well as change and shower
facilities. Cost is $4.00 and $4.00 for weight room use. Proof of conference 
attendance is required (your conference registration receipt).

Parking at the University OF Victoria:

All University of Victoria campus guests are required to purchase a daily 
parking permit to park during the day Monday to Friday.  Parking is 
restricted to the lots located outside the Ring Road (parking in the lots 
inside the Ring is restricted to Staff).  After 6:00 pm and on weekends, 
parking is free in all lots except Lot B, Elliott Building (inside Ring Road) 
and the University Centre Building underground lot. The $4 daily parking 
permits can be obtained at parking meters situated just after you enter the 
university grounds and in all parking lots. You will need exact coin change 
or a credit card, depending upon the machine. If you have a Handicapped 
Parking permit, sticker, or designation, please bring this with you to use 
in the designated parking spaces on campus. If you need such a permit, 
indicate this in the Special Needs section of the registration form.

=============================================================================

SPECIAL EVENTS:

Victoria is consistently ranked as one of the ten top tourist destinations 
in the world. Participants will find a wealth of activities in which they 
can participate before, during, and after the conference. Activities range 
from the justifiably famous Royal British Columbia Museum and Butchart 
Gardens, whale watching and adventure tours, to shopping for art from the 
vibrant artistic community in the region. Abundant information is available 
on the WWW and will also be available at registration.
 
We are hoping that the ambience of the University of Victoria campus will 
lead to many opportunities for informal and stimulating scientific discussions.
To encourage interactions, we are planning three special events.

Opening Reception: 

The National Research Council of Canada and its Herzberg Institute of 
Astrophysics are hosting an Opening Reception to which they invite all
participants.  It will be held between 6 and 9 pm on Sunday, 12 July at 
the University of Victoria. A variety of canapes and light fare will be 
provided in a setting that will enable persons to renew old acquaintances 
and to make new ones. A no-host bar will be available.  Please indicate
on the registration form if you (and any possible guests) will attend the
reception.

Tour of the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory: 
 
Eighty years ago, on 6 May 1918, the first observation was obtained with 
the 1.8-m Plaskett Telescope on Little Saanich Mountain some 17 km from 
the UVic campus.  Early work at DAO focussed on fundamental problems of 
stellar and Galactic astrophysics, with results that have been subsumed 
into modern textbooks.  Today the Observatory is an active research centre 
with emphasis on primitive solar system bodies, stellar astrophysics, 
stellar populations in the Milky Way and relatively nearby galaxies, the 
interstellar medium, extragalactic astrophysics including AGN's, and 
observational cosmology.  It is also home to the Director General of the
Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics; to the groups supporting Canadian 
involvement in off-shore projects such as the Gemini 8-m Telescopes, the 
James Clerk Maxwell Telescope, the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, and the 
FUSE spacecraft; to active development of inovative instrumentation in the 
UV, optical, near-IR and sub-mm; as well as to the Canadian Astronomy Data 
Centre with its archives of HST, CFHT, and JCMT data, and other on-line 
research tools.

At the close of the Wednesday morning (15 July) sessions, meeting
participants will be able to board buses that will bring them to DAO, where 
they will be able to enjoy a box lunch with the staff (in picnic style on 
the lawn, weather permitting), followed by a tour of the facilities.  At 
the close of the tour, people will have the choice of being returned to the 
UVic campus or to downtown Victoria, where they may pursue leisure activities 
of their choice.  The transportation is provided by NRC, but participants 
are asked to pay for their meal.  If you are interested in joining the tour
please fill out the appropriate space on the registration form below or
on the WWW.

Banquet:
 
The meeting banquet will be held at the University of Victoria Faculty Club
on Thursday, 16 July. The meal will be buffet style with a wide variety of 
foods with a regional emphasis (including Pacific salmon and vegetarian
fare), and a no-host bar will be available. The LOC is working on special 
touches to make the evening unusually memorable. Do plan on joining your 
colleagues in this lovely setting for a pleasant evening!

Lunch Package:

For your convenience, we have arranged for a special lunch option for
conference delegates.  This option provides for a pre-paid lunch for four
days of the conference (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday).  Because
the campus dining locations may be busy with staff and other visitors to
campus, we want to ensure that you will be served lunch promptly and thus,
assist in keeping the meeting's schedule on time.  Menus will include
BBQ's, pizzas and salads, and buffets.  Vegetarian options will be 
available for those who indicate this requirement on the registration form.
The lunch package is available on a first come, first served basis, and a
limited number of tickets are available.  To choose this option, please
complete the appropriate section of the registration form.

=============================================================================

ACCOMMODATION:

The University of Victoria Office of Conference Management (CM) has a 
limited number of rooms available for "New Views of the Magellanic Clouds" 
participants at the new University of Victoria Cluster Housing complex, 
Commonwealth Village, that was built for the 1994 Commonwealth Games athletes.
These units are furnished housekeeping units with four separate (single bed) 
bedrooms, each with individual locks.  Each unit has a living room, dining 
area, 1.5 bathrooms, and a fully equipped kitchen.  This accommodation is 
rented by the unit only, not by individual reservations, so that CM must 
assign individuals to each bedroom.  Continental breakfast is included with 
the accommodation rate of CDN$45/day (about US$31) for each bedroom.  A 
grocery store is located in a nearby shopping centre. 

CM will endeavor to put groups of participants together to fill a cluster 
unit.  CM will also attempt to put participants of the same gender together 
but cannot guarantee that this will occur in every instance.  Additionally, 
CM will be unable to make on-site changes, based on personality differences, 
etc.

If you want CM to reserve a room for you in the Commonwealth Village please 
include this information on your Registration Form.  The deadline for room 
reservations is 15 April 1998.  Because of the limited number of rooms 
available, reservations are on a "first come, first served" basis.  
Reservations will be made only if fees are fully paid in advance.  Keys to 
accommodations are obtained directly from the Housing Office, which is open 
24 hours.  If you arrive prior to the conference dates, you may be 
temporarily assigned to one unit and then relocated to another unit effective 
11 or 12 July.

Alternatively, if you would prefer off-campus hotel or bed and breakfast 
accommodation, you will need to make your own reservations.  The meeting 
date coincides with high season in Victoria, so hotel accommodations should 
be arranged well in advance of arrival.  There are many excellent hotels 
and B & B's in Victoria, most within an easy commute by city bus to the 
University of Victoria Campus.  We have held small blocks of rooms 
(at reduced rates with reservation deadlines of 15 May 1998) at three 
locations (note: these are not in downtown Victoria):
