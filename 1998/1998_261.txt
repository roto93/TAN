Dear Colleagues,

As you may know, a meeting "Star Formation 1999" will be held in Japan
(June 21-25, 1999; see below for more details). This is a meeting 
for Prof. T. Nakano, who is going to retire from the Nobeyama Radio 
Observatory, Japan next March. Several famous astronomers are being 
invited to the meeting, too. The second circular is going to be distributed 
at the middle of the next January.

Actually, the LOC of this meeting is planning to get a budget for
financial supports to attendees (mainly students and postdocs from Asia),
and is surveying how many people are interested in this financial support.
The attendees, who get the support, are expected to present posters at the
meeting.

I was asked to survey for young astronomers in Taiwan, who are interested in
this financial support.

If you are interested in this support as well as presenting a poster 
at the meeting, please let me know the followings by 1/31/1999:

1. Name
2. Institute
3. Position
4. Your poster title with a short abstract
5. Supervisor's name (if you have)

I am looking forward to hearing from you.

Cheers,

Nagayoshi Ohashi

        The aim of this conference is to summarize our present 
        knowledge on star formation and foresee future directions.
        This conference will cover all the topics related star 
        formation, e.g, molecular clouds and cores, protostars
        and their associated disks, jets and other activities from
        YSOs, binary and cluster formation, and star formation in nearby
        and young galaxies.  The conference consists of invited talks 
        by the researchers in the forefront of the study of star 
        formation. We also prepare a large hall for poster presentations.
