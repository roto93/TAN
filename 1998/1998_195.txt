Session 1:  Colloquium (2:30 - 3:30 pm)

            SPEAKER: Dr. Ralf Kaiser

	    TITLE:   "Cosmic ray particle induced formation 
	              of molecules in frozen ices"
            ABSTRACT:
The reaction products of cosmic ray particle induced reactions of energetic
(suprathermal) carbon (C) and hydrogen (H) atoms with methane (CH4), ethene
(C2H4), and acetylene (C2H2) ices at 10 K are investigated experimentally.
Ices are irradiated in an ultra high vacuum vessel with 9.0 MeV alpha-particles
and 7.3 MeV protons, and analyzed on line and in situ via a quadrupole mass
spectrometer (QMS, gas phase) and Fourier transform infrared spectrometer
(FTIR, solid state). The experiments show that suprathermal H and C atoms
lead to a broad product spectrum of synthesized molecules ranging from
atomic and molecular hydrogen, H and H2, CHn  (n = 1  4), C2Hn (n = 1  6),
C3Hn (n = 4  8), larger alkanes and alkenes with up to 18 carbon atoms, and
to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) as complex as coronene. The
explicit identification of these reaction products in the solid state at 10 K 
opens a versatile pathway to a cosmic ray induced formation of molecules
in interstellar ices. These investigations show synthetic routes to
astronomically observed C2H2, C2H4, and CH3CCH molecules and postulate
formation mechanisms of hitherto unobserved interstellar molecules.
Further, the cosmic ray particle induced formation of H2 inside ices offers
a strong alternative to hitherto assumed formation of H2 via grain-surface
chemistry. Finally, the identification of PAH molecules suggests, that these
species are very likely formed in carbon-rich interstellar grains - a
powerful option compared to postulated gas-phase reactions proceeding thru
stepwise condensation of C2H2 and C2H molecules.
