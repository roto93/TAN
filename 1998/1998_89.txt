VLBA Releases 1000th Scientific Observation
--------------------------------------------

The VLBA released its 1000th scientific observation today, 1998 April 28,
not quite four years after its first release on 1994 May 4, and six years
after the VLBA correlator detected its first fringes on 1992 May 6.  Also
released very recently was the first observation whose project code ser-
ial number exceeded 100; the winner of this race was letter M.

The 1000 observations can be classified as 832 (ground-based) astronomi-
cal programs using the VLBA only (plus possibly a single VLA antenna, the
entire phased VLA, and/or the Effelsberg 100-m), 92 global VLBI Network
experiments, 44 VSOP scientific observations with various ground arrays,
and 32 geodetic programs.  An additional 166 test observations were also
released during the same interval, including 36 VSOP pre-launch and in-
orbit-checkout tests.

The period spanned by the full set of 1166 observations comprised: 34944
hours overall elapsed time; 14560 hours of observing; 19645 hours total
correlator production time; and 10438 hours of final correlation.  The
usual VLBA efficiencies formed as ratios of these times were: 74% correl-
ation efficiency; 53% production efficiency; and 42% VLBA operational
efficiency.  [Definitions of these statistics are available in the Ex-
planation to the VLBA correlator efficiency plots on the VLBA Web site.]

A total length of 2.0 Gm of tape was recorded at ten VLBA stations and
played back to correlate these observations.  This distance is 50 times
the equatorial circumference of the Earth, five times the mean distance
of the Moon, and half again the diameter of the Sun.

The mean release rate over the four-year period was 0.83 observation per
day, while the latency, from observation to completion of correlation,
averaged 21 days for VLBA (i.e., non-global) observations.
