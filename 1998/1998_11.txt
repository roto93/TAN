>ORGANIC MATERIAL IN MARTIAN METEORITE FOUND TO BE FROM EARTH
>
>	Organic material contained in a meteorite heralded as bearing
>signs of previous life on Mars is actually from Earth.
>
>	Scientists at UCSD's Scripps Institution of Oceanography and the
>University of Arizona in Tucson report in two separate papers in the
>Jan. 16 issue of Science that the potato-sized rock
>was contaminated by the surrounding Antarctic ice in which it was
>found. The scientists are the first to publish results of tests of
>organic material contained in the meteorite, named Allan Hills 84001
>(ALH84001), since research teams at NASA's Johnson Space Center and
>Stanford University announced their results in August, 1996.
>
>	"This is bad news with respect to using these meteorites to assess
>whether there ever was or is life on Mars," said Jeff Bada, a professor
>of marine chemistry who headed the Scripps team. "It shows that the
>meteorites aren't going to give us a definitive answer."
>
>	Bada's team analyzed amino acids contained within a sample from the
>meteorite while Timothy Jull's team at the University of Arizona
>examined the radiocarbon activity of the bulk organics.=20
>
>	"What we found was that, yes, there are amino acids in the meteorite
>at very low
>levels, but they are clearly terrestrial and they look similar to amino
>acids we see in the surrounding Antarctic ice," Bada said. "How they
>got in there is still an open issue."
>
>	Likewise, Jull's team used 14C and 13C tracers to determine the origin
>of the carbonate minerals and organic carbon in the meteorite.  Their
>results indicated that the bulk of organic material in ALH84001 is
>contaminated material it acquired after falling to Earth.
>
>	"It looks like regular terrestrial organic material," Jull said. "The
>14C content of it suggests that there were several episodes of
>contamination."
>
>	Scientists at Johnson Space Center and Stanford reported in Aug. 1996
>that they had found the first organic molecules thought to be Martian
>in origin.  Called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHS), these
>organic molecules were found in easily detectable amounts in tiny globs
>of carbonate within the meteorite. They also noted finding several
>mineral features characteristic of biological activity and possible
>microscopic fossils of primitive, bacteria-like organisms inside the
>meteorite.  Their findings were published in the Aug. 16, 1996, issue
>of Science.
>
>	The scientists proposed that very primitive microorganisms may have
>assisted in the formation of the carbonate, and some of the microscopic
>organisms may have become fossilized, in a fashion similar to the
>formation of fossils in limestone on Earth.
>
>	Jull's analysis of isotopes contained in organic material and
>carbonate from the meteorite, however, indicates the two are of a
>completely different origin, making a relationship between the two
>impossible.
>
>	"The organic material contains 14C and the carbonate doesn't because
>the carbonate came from somewhere in space, presumably Mars, and the
>organic material is a recent addition which took place while the
>meteorite was sitting on the ice," Jull said. "So, there is no
>connection between the two things."
>
>	Bada said he chose to focus his analysis on amino acids within the
>meteorite because, unlike PAHS, they play an essential role in
>biochemistry.
>
>	An expert in the analysis of amino acids, Bada used high-performance
>liquid chromatography to analyze amino acids in the meteorite to
>determine their "handedness." He found that the bulk of the amino acids
>consisted of the left-handed forms similar to that seen in the Allan
>Hills ice in Antarctica where the meteorite was found. Bada said he
>could not rule out the possibility that minute amounts of some
>extra-terrestrial amino acids such as right-handed forms of alanine
>were preserved in the meteorite.
>
>	"What we and Tim Jull's team have shown is that there is no evidence
>in our hands that the meteorite contains any compounds that we could
>definitely trace to Mars except maybe some tiny mysterious component
>that we don't understand at this point," he said.
>
>	Bada said scientists will have to wait until a Mars mission scheduled
>for 2005 to bring back samples from the Martian surface to determine
>whether life ever graced the planet.
>
>	"In the meantime, we can throw any kind of analyses that we want to at
>these meteorites and we are not going to provide an answer one way or
>another about whether life existed  on Mars," he said.
>
>	Co-authors of the Scripps paper are Daniel Glavin, a Scripps graduate
>student; Gene McDonald, of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory; and Luann
>Becker, of the University of Hawaii. Co-authors of the University of
>Arizona paper are Christopher Courtney, Daniel Jeffrey and Warren Beck,
>all of the University of Arizona.
