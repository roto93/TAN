                    VLBI Earth Science Support

  NVI, Inc. is seeking qualified candidates for up to three
anticipated positions in geodetic Very Long Baseline
Interferometry (VLBI). The work will be performed under NVI
Inc.'s contract that supports the VLBI group at NASA's Goddard
Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, MD. The successful applicants
will be members of the Goddard VLBI team and will be interacting
with the international VLBI community. Candidates are sought for
the following positions:

  (1) Scientist for VLBI Analysis. This position supports
contributions to advancement of the VLBI technique through
research in areas such as atmosphere modeling, geophysical
modeling, combination of data from different techniques, use of
VLBI for orbit determination, and advanced estimation strategies.
The position also involves analyzing VLBI data using SOLVE/GLOBL
with particular emphasis on analyzing results of the CORE
(Continuous Observations of the Rotation of the Earth) program
sessions. The applicant will be expected to contribute to the
scientific research goals of the Goddard VLBI group, make
presentations at scientific meetings, and publish papers in
refereed journals. Applicants for this position must have a good
understanding of the VLBI technique and prior experience with
VLBI data analysis. The applicant should have an advanced degree
in one of the physical sciences or mathematics. 

  (2) Scientist for VLBI Field System. This position supports
development and maintenance of the Field System, a PC/Linux-based
field software control system for VLBI data acquisition. The
position also involves designing and developing custom interface
software for unique station hardware, Linux system
administration, and management of PC hardware configurations. The
applicant will be expected to provide technical support and
training in all areas of VLBI data acquisition to VLBI staff at
stations around the world. Applicants for this position should
have experience with VLBI data acquisition at a working station
and experience using and developing software for Linux systems.
This position includes travel to VLBI stations for software and
system installation, testing, and training. The applicant should
have an advanced degree in one of the physical sciences or
mathematics.

  (3) Data Technician/Programmer for IVS (International VLBI
Service) Coordinating Center support. Responsibilities of this
position include maintenance of IVS information system data
bases, including gathering and entering data; production and
distribution of IVS reports and documentation; data archiving;
IVS product delivery support. The applicant will also contribute
to development of data presentation software including web-based
applications. The applicant should have a degree in one of the
