Dear Colleague,

    We would like to draw your attention to a conference on:

         CHEMICAL EVOLUTION FROM ZERO TO HIGH REDSHIFT

    to be held at ESO Headquarters, Garching, Germany from
                     October 14-16, 1998.

The topic of the conference is the determination and interpretation of 
chemical abundances and evolution from stars, inter-stellar medium and 
local group galaxies at zero redshift to distant galaxies, clusters of 
galaxies and inter-galactic medium at high redshift. Whilst problems
undoubtedly remain in the determination of stellar and nebular 
abundances in the nearby Milky Way, abundance determinations are 
beginning to converge. The observational and interpretive tools are 
starting to be mature enough that they can be applied with some 
confidence to extra-galactic systems and integrated populations at 
increasingly high redshift. Ultimately the tools should be applicable to 
determination of the chemistry and enrichment of young galaxies at large 
look-back times.

The broad aim of the conference is to assess the interplay between methods
of measuring chemical abundances with the astrophysical models of galaxy
evolution. About half of the conference will be devoted to consideration of
abundances and the factors that regulate them in nearby well-studied systems
of the Milky Way and Local Group Galaxies. The remainder will concentrate on
more distant systems where the abundance data is more slender and the tools
under refinement. In addition there will be sessions on forthcoming and
future instrumentation applicable to abundance determinations across the
whole electromagnetic spectrum. The format for the meeting is invited talks,
with contributed papers as talks or posters and some discussion sessions.

There will be five main facets to the conference. The invited
speakers are indicated. 

     1. The Milky Way
        o Abundances from local disk stars (B. Gustafsson)
        o Massive star abundances (D. Lennon)
        o H II region abundance data (M. Peimbert)
        o Abundances in the Galactic bulge (A. McWilliam)
        o Abundances in interstellar gas (D. Meyer)
        o Constraints on abundances from interstellar dust (J. Mathis)
        o Galactic scale gradients (F. Matteucci)

     2. Abundances in Nearby Galaxies
        o The Magellanic Clouds (B. Pagel)
        o Nearby dwarf galaxies (E. Skillman)
        o Spiral and irregular galaxies (D.Garnett)
        o Elliptical galaxies (G. Worthey)
        o Galaxy cluster data (A. Renzini)
        o Effect of environment on galaxy abundances (not yet confirmed)

     3. Evolution of Abundances
        o Abundance enrichment from supernovae (F. Thielemann)
        o Dynamical effects on chemical evolution (M. Edmunds)
        o Effect of mergers on abundances (M. Haehnelt)
        o Dust and molecules at high z (F. Combes)
        o Chemical evolution of intergalactic gas (G. Kauffmann) 

     4. The Distant Universe
        o Abundances in QSO absorption line systems (M. Pettini)
        o Intergalactic gas abundances (A. Songaila)
        o Dust and molecules at high z (F. Combes)
        o Abundances in high z starburst galaxies (C. Leitherer)
        o Primordial abundances (D. Tytler)

     5. New Windows on Abundance Determinations
        o Present and forthcoming UV missions (E. Jenkins)
        o Optical instrumentation on large telescopes (S. D'Odorico)
        o X-ray missions (S. Kahn)
        o IR spectroscopy (N. Thatte)
        o Radio and mm/sub-mm instruments (to be confirmed)
