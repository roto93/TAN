Dear Colleague:
 
     NASA has approved development of a Wide Field
  Camera 3 (WFC3) for installation in the HST on the 2002 Servicing
  Mission.  A Scientific Oversight Committee (SOC) is being established
  to ensure that the broad interests of the scientific community are
  represented in the development of WFC3.  The primary task of the SOC will
  be to advise the HST Project and STScI in all areas of scientific
  performance of WFC3.  We would like to invite you to participate in
  the development of the WFC3 by applying for membership on the SOC.
 
          The WFC3, which is described in more detail in
  http://www.stsci.edu/ftp/instrument_news/WFC3/wfc3.html will be built as 
  a facility instrument.  It is intended to be a replacement for the WFPC2 to 
  ensure that the HST will continue to have superb imaging capabilities 
  throughout its lifetime, recently extended to the year 2010.
 
          A team of scientists and engineers from within the HST Project
  at GSFC and from the STScI will be responsible for the day to day
  activities associated with the WFC3 project.  This team will be led by an
  Instrument Scientist and an Instrument Manager, both from GSFC, and an
  Operations Scientist from STScI.

  The SOC will provide broad scientific oversight and guidance
  to the WFC3 project.  In particular, it is expected that the SOC will
  define the key scientific objectives achievable by WFC3, within the
  constraints of its main characteristics, e.g., optical configuration
  and detectors.  The SOC will
 
  a) define the key scientific goals for WFC3, in particular, define a
  representative set of scientific programs to be used in the
  development of a Design Reference Mission.
 
  b) define the main scientific success criteria for WFC3, and help
  determine the technical trade-offs and assess performance against these
  criteria.
 
  c) recommend the set of filters to be incorporated in the WFC3 for the
  optimal execution of the scientific program (broad community input will be
  sought as part of the  SOC's deliberations on this issue).
 
  d) participate in the selection of the flight and spare detectors,
  including the trade-offs of the performance parameters (QE,
  read-noise, cosmetics, etc.) and scientific objectives.
 
  e) assist in the prioritization of major operational modes.
 
  f)  participate in the major project reviews.
 
	  It is expected that the SOC will meet an average of 3 to 4 times each
  year.  Since WFC3 is to be built as a facility class instrument, there will
  be no guaranteed observing time for the  SOC members or any other scientist.
  Travel and incidental expenses will be covered,  but we expect the members of
  the SOC to be willing to serve on this committee as a service to the
  astronomical community and as their representatives.

	  We invite scientists interested in participating in the SOC to submit
  a short (2-3 pages maximum) letter with their personal qualifications and a
  description of their expertise in the scientific and technical areas
  associated with the WFC3, outlining the contributions they expect to make to
  the successful completion of the project.  The letter should be sent to Dr.
  Duccio Macchetto at the STScI by April 30, 1998.  

	  The SOC members will be selected by a peer-review panel at the
  Institute, whose task  will be to evaluate the qualifications and the
  scientific merits of the proposed contributions.  The SOC will be selected so
  as to ensure that a broad range of astronomical disciplines and technical
  expertise are represented.  The SOC will be formally appointed by the NASA
  Program Scientist for HST, E. Weiler and it will report jointly to the STScI
  Director and to the HST Project Scientist. The HST Program Scientist,the HST
  Project Scientist and the STScI Director will be invited to be present
  during  the discussions and deliberations of the SOC.  The  SOC will work
  closely with and provide advise to the WFC3 Instrument Scientist and the
  Operations Scientist.

          We hope you will take an interest in participating in the scientific
  oversight of the WFPC3.

		  Sincerely,

		  Robert Williams                    Duccio Macchetto 
                  Director               Associate Director for Science Programs
