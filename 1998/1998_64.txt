                    First Announcement
                      March 15,1998


            The 4th East Asia Meeting on Astronomy
     Observational Astrophysics in Asia and its Future
               in Kunming, China, Feb 6-14, 1999


Objectives and Scientific Topics:

     The objectives of the 4th EAMA meeting are to highlight the
following
   topics and to illustrate the aspects of the observational astrophysics
   in Asia and its Future. The proposed topics are:

   1.  Scientific results from ground-based and space telescopes
       mainly in Asia,
   2.  Development, construction and plans for telescopes and
       related instruments,
   3.  Surveys,experiments and develpments of astronomical sites
       in Asia,
   4.  Proposals and discussions on collaboration in Asia.

Venue:

      The meeting will be held in Kunming,the capital of Yunnan province
   southwest of China. Kunming enjoys the fame of "City of Eternal
Spring".
   Its urban population is about 1.2 million. It is about 1900 meters
above
   sea level. Its average temperature in February is about 10 degrees
   centigrade. Kunming is a beautiful and historical cultural city,
scenic
   Dian Chi lake and the Western Hill forest park lie nearby, and famous
   Stone Forest is not far apart.

      Li Jiang, the "World Cultural Heritage" chosen by the UN and one of
   national tourist scenic spots in China, is located in the northwest of
   Yunnan province about 600km from Kunming by bus, and is about 2400
meters
   above sea level. The average temperature in February is nearly 8
degrees
   centigrade.The region is famous for its very beautiful natural
   landscapes and attractions. The hieroglyphic writing of the Naxi
   nationality is one of the most interesting ancient scripts in China.
   The Dongba culture of the Naxi nationality has remained at a primitive
   stage, and many of its ancient traditions are still kept today. The
site,
   Gaomeigu, about 40 km from Li Jiang, has been chosen as a new
potential
   astronomical observation station of Yunnan Observatory after years of
site
   survey work. A large optical telescope is planned to be set up at the
   station.
