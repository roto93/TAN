BIMA Summer School - 1998 June 1-5 and 8-12
-------------------------------------------

Dear Participant,

We will hold a BIMA summer school at Hat Creek this summer.
There are 23 students, so we will hold 2 sessions in order to
provide adequate facilities for everyone.
Last time there was a large range in previous experience.
In order not to leave beginners behind, nor to bore the
more advanced students, we plan to make the 1st session
somewhat more basic, and the 2nd more advanced. Both
sessions will cover the same material, with lectures,
demonstrations and student projects and observations at night.

Please select which week you would like to attend.
If either session is OK for you, please tell me that too,
since we need to balance the two sessions.

The school will run from Monday 9am to Friday 5 pm
1998 June 1-5 and 8-12. You are welcome to stay at Hat Creek
on Saturday/Sunday to continue your projects.
Accommodation is available in shared rooms at the observatory.
Expected weather in June is warm (80F) with rain possible.

You should plan to travel to Hat Creek on the Sunday and depart 
the following Saturday or Sunday. The closest airports are
Reno or Redding, where rental cars are available.
We will arrange a car pool to and from Berkeley, which is a
5-6 hour drive from Hat Creek. The closest airports to Berkeley
are San Francisco or Oakland, with public transport available from both.

Please indicate your preference for dates, room mates, and mode of travel.

                Thanks,

                        Melvyn
