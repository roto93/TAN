  We present ISOCAM observations of five fields in the Large Magellanic
Cloud centered on IRAS point sources with colors of ultracompact HII regions.
Three bright sources of parsec or subparsec size, with luminosities consistent
with being embedded O stars, are detected at 15 $\mu$m in two fields
belonging to the HII region N 159. Using published high resolution
radio observations, it is found that two of these sources may be ultracompact
HII regions with a turnover frequency above 2.4 GHz, while the other is
identified with a known compact HII region. If their nature as true
ultracompact HII regions is confirmed by follow-up observations, these
objects can provide a first sample useful for future studies of early massive
star evolution in a low metallicity environment.  \\

Several structures have been discovered embedded in regions of recent
or ongoing star formation, which point to the importance of the
interaction between fast moving wind-blowing stars and their environment.
Using hydrodynamic simulations, we investigate the passage through the
interstellar medium of a supersonic stellar wind source, and show how
it can naturally lead to the formation of tubes, channels and swamps
of globules as interfaces are crossed. The results are in excellent
agreement with observation of 30 Doradus.

Archival $HST$ FOS and GHRS data sets have been used to collect ultraviolet
evidence for
large- and small-scale stellar wind structure in extragalactic
Local Group OB
stars (i.e. SMC, LMC including R136, M~31, M~33, and NGC~6822).
By comparison to previous
studies of Galactic OB stars, wind activity is principally
diagnosed in individual spectrograms via the presence of `narrow absorption
components' and saturated `black' absorption troughs in the
resonance line doublets. Their characteristics broadly suggest
that these stars share the same physical mechanisms for
perturbing the winds as those that act in Galactic stars.
Both these spectral indicators are also used to provide
reliable measures
of wind terminal velocities. These velocities are directly compared
to previously published Galactic values, without reliance
on model profile fitting.
Relative to Galactic OB stars, the most discrepant terminal velocities
(and wind line profiles) are due to {\it main-sequence} early
O-type stars in the SMC.

We report the detection of 22 GHz H$_2$O maser emission from the red
supergiant IRAS04553$-$6825 in the Large Magellanic Cloud. It is the first
known source of circumstellar H$_2$O maser emission outside the Milky Way. The
measured flux density is comparable to that expected from scaling the galactic
red supergiant NML Cyg. The peak velocity agrees with the SiO maser peak
velocity.

A near-infrared spectrum indicates that IRAS04553$-$6825 has a typical LMC
metallicity. We argue that, possibly as a result of the low metallicity, the
H$_2$O emission probably occurs near or within the dust formation radius,
rather than further out as appears to be the case in NML Cyg and galactic
OH/IR stars.

The morphology of planetary nebulae (PNe) provides an essential tool for
understanding their origin and evolution, as it reflects both the dynamics
of the gas ejected during the TP--AGB phase, and the central star
energetics. Here we study the morphology of 27 Magellanic Cloud planetary
nebulae (MCPNe) 
and present an analysis of their physical characteristics across
morphological classes. Similar studies have been successfully carried out
for galactic PNe, but were compromised by the uncertainty of individual PN
distances. 
We present our own HST/FOC images of 15 Magellanic Cloud PNe
(MCPNe) acquired through a narrow-band $\lambda$5007 [O~${\sc iii}$]
filter.  We use the Richardson--Lucy deconvolution technique on these
pre--COSTAR images to achieve post--COSTAR quality. Three PNe imaged
before and after COSTAR confirm the high reliability of our deconvolution
procedure.  We derive morphological classes, dimensions, and surface
photometry for all these PNe.  We have combined this sample with HST/PC1
images of 15 MCPNe, three of which are in common with the FOC set, 
acquired by Dopita et al. (1996), to obtain the
largest MCPN sample ever examined from the morphological viewpoint. By
using the whole database, supplemented with published data from the
literature, we have analyzed the properties of the MCPNe and compared them
to a typical, complete galactic sample. Morphology of the MCPNe is
then correlated with PN density, chemistry, and evolution.

We present three color, {\it BVI} maps of the Small Magellanic  Cloud.
The maps contain precise photometric and astrometric data for about 2.2 
million stars from the central regions of the SMC bar covering
${\approx2.4}$  square degrees on the sky. Mean brightness of stars is
derived from  observations collected in the course of the OGLE-II
microlensing search from  about 130, 30 and 15 measurements in the {\it
I}, {\it V} and {\it B}-bands,  respectively. Accuracy of the zero
points of photometry is about 0.01~mag, and  astrometry 0.15~arcsec
(with possible systematic error up to 0.7~arcsec).  Color-magnitude
diagrams of observed fields are also presented. 

The maps of the SMC are the first from the series of similar maps
covering  other OGLE fields: LMC, Galactic bulge and Galactic disk. The
data are very  well suited for many projects, particularly for the SMC
which has been  neglected photometrically for years. Because of
potentially great impact on  many astrophysical fields we decided to
make the SMC data available to the  astronomical community from the OGLE
Internet archive.

{\Large\bf Hot Gas in the Large Magellanic Cloud}
\end{center}
\centerline{\bf You-Hua Chu}{\footnotesize
Astronomy Department, University of Illinois, 
1002 W. Green Street, Urbana, IL 61801, USA}\\

Massive stars interact with the interstellar medium (ISM) 
via UV radiation, fast stellar winds, and supernova ejecta.  
These energetic interactions ionize, accelerate, and heat 
the ISM, producing hot gas with temperatures up to 10$^7$ K.
The mass exchange between this hot gas and the cold neutral
gas constitutes the evolution of a multi-phase ISM.

Hot ionized gas is an essential component of the ISM.  
However, it is difficult to study the distribution and 
physical properties of hot gas in the Galaxy because of 
confusion and obscuration along the Galactic plane.  
The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), owing to its close 
proximity, nearly face-on view, and small extinction, 
presents an ideal site to study hot gas and its role 
in the interstellar matrix.

Soft X-ray images of the LMC show bright diffuse emission,
indicating the existence of hot (10$^6$--10$^7$ K) ionized 
gas.  Clues to the origin of the hot gas in the LMC are 
provided by comparisons between X-ray and H$\alpha$ images.
H$\alpha$ images of the LMC show a variety of interstellar 
shells, ranging from small supernova remnants a few pc 
in diameter to large supergiant shells more than 
1000 pc across.  Some of the diffuse X-ray emission is 
associated with shell structures, but there is also 
large-scale diffuse emission that does not appear
to be confined by any cooler interstellar structures.
The origins of hot gas in these different types of diffuse 
X-ray emission regions are individually discussed.

A hot (10$^5$ K) gas halo of the LMC was suggested in 
the early 1980's.  As most of the previously reported 
interstellar C~{\sc iv} absorption occurs in large shell 
structures where supernovae and fast stellar winds are 
rampant, the evidence for a global hot gas halo around the 
LMC has been weak.  Recent HST GHRS observations of 
five carefully chosen probe stars show clear detections 
of the interstellar C\,{\sc iv}, providing unambiguous
evidence for a hot gas halo of the LMC.  Three sightlines 
have C\,{\sc iv} velocities blue shifted from the H$\alpha$ 
by 25--60 km~s$^{-1}$, indicating that the hot gas halo 
may be expanding away from the disk gas.  The hot gas halo 
of the LMC is most likely patchy, as implied by a stringent 
nondetection by the IUE along one sightline.  \\

{\Large\bf  Star Formation Histories of Local Group Dwarf Galaxies}
\end{center}
\centerline{\bf Eva K.\ Grebel}{\footnotesize
UCO/Lick Observatory, University of California at Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz,
CA 95064, USA}\\


40 galaxies are currently known as, or suspected to be Local Group members 
within a radius of 1.8 Mpc.  37 of these galaxies are dwarf galaxies with 
$M_B > -18.5$ mag. I present a compilation of the star formation histories 
of dwarf irregulars, dwarf ellipticals, and dwarf spheroidals in the Local 
Group, and visualize their evolutionary histories through Hodge's population 
boxes. 

The study of these star formation histories is a multi-parameter problem: 
Ages, metallicities, population fractions, and spatial variations must be 
determined, which depend crucially on the knowledge of reddening and distance. 

Even the lowest-mass dwarf spheroidal galaxies can show significant spatial 
variations in star formation, ages, and metallicities. All Local Group dwarf 
galaxies appear to contain old ($>10$ Gyr) and intermediate-age ($1-10$ Gyr) 
populations irrespective of morphological type.  No two galaxies are alike. 
They vary widely in star formation histories, metallicities, fractions, and 
ages of their subpopulations even within the same morphological type. Star
formation has occurred either in distinct episodes or continuously over long 
periods of time.\\

The monograph describes in extenso the present state of massive star
research seen from the standpoint of stellar evolution, with special
emphasis on close binaries. Statistics of massive close binaries are
reasonably complete for the Solar neighbourhood. We demonstrate that within
our knowledge, many scientific results where the effect of binaries are
ignored, have an academic value but may be far from reality.

In chapter I, we summarize general observations of massive stars where we
focus on the HR diagram, stellar wind mass loss rates, the stellar surface
chemistry, rotation, circumstellar environments, supernovae.

Close binaries can not be studied separately from single stars and vice
versa. First, the evolution of single stars is discussed (chapter II). We
present new calculations with updated stellar wind mass loss rate
formalisms. Especially the rates during the red supergiant phase and the
rates during the Wolf-Rayet (WR) phase are different compared to previous
values and this affects in a profound way the evolution during core helium
burning. The computations are compared in detail to representative
observations. The chapter ends with a general discussion on the effects of
rotation on massive single star evolution.

Massive binaries, the main topic of the work, are considered in chapter
III. Basic processes are described, i.e. the Roche lobe overflow and mass
transfer, the common envelope process, the spiral-in process in binaries
with extreme mass ratio, the mass accretion process and the merging
process, the effect of the (asymmetric) supernova explosion of one of the
components on the orbital parameters of the binary. Evolutionary
computations of interacting close binaries are discussed and general
conclusions are drawn. The enormous amount of observational data of massive
binaries is summarized. We separately consider the non-evolved and evolved
systems. The latter class includes the semi-detached and contact binaries,
the WR binaries, the X-ray binaries, the runaways, the single and binary
pulsars. A general comparison between theoretical evolution and
observations is combined with a discussion of specially interesting
binaries: the evolved binaries HD 163181, HD 12323, HD 14633, HD 193516, HD
25638, HD 209481, $\phi$ Per and $\upsilon$ Sgr; the WR+OB binaries
$\gamma^2$Vel, V444 Cyg; the high mass X-ray binaries Vela X-1, Wray 977,
Cyg X-1; the low mass X-ray binaries Her X-1 and those with a black hole
candidate; the runaways $\zeta$ Oph and $\zeta$ Pup, the WR+compact
companion candidates HD 50896 and Cyg X-3; the supernova event SN 1987A. We
finally propose an overall evolutionary model of massive close binaries as
a function of primary mass, mass ratio and orbital period.

The fourth chapter deals with massive star population synthesis with a
realistic population of binaries. We discuss the massive close binary
frequency, mass ratio and period distribution, the observations that allow
to constrain possible asymmetries during the supernova explosion of a
massive star. Observed star numbers (as a function of metallicity) are then
compared to theoretically predicted numbers where we focus on stellar
populations in regions of continuous star formation and in starburst
regions. Special attention is given to the O-type star/WR star/red
supergiant star population, the pulsar and binary pulsar population, the
supernova rates.

The monograph counts 347 pages, contains a considerable amount of new
results and will be useful as reference work for everybody working in the
field of massive stars in general, in the field of massive binaries in
particular. Our hope is that this book encourages youngish researchers to
pursue binary research, rather than fall into the bottomless pit of
extra-Galactic research, including the eternal and largely illusory quest
for 'standard candles'. Probably the best standard candles are, or will be,
massive OB eclipsing systems, which in principle are capable of giving
distances independent of the usual chain of hypotheses.
