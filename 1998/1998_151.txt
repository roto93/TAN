Dear TANists,

I figure we astronomers are just a daughter group (subset) of the parent
group, which is by a more general definition -- "Chinese". So here I
forward the following sad news to you all. Hopefully we can do something
about it when possible.

Hi, Yi-Jehng,

   Do you know anything about the Indonesian Chinese
encountering a gruesome atrocities? Here is some news about it. I don't
know if it is appropriate to send these messages over the TANs network, so
I forward them to you and let you decide it. There is a yellow
ribbon campaign spreading all over the world to protest these atrocities,
I think, as a chinese (or taiwanese), we should be aware of this.

Dear friends,
  Please forward this "Yellow Ribbon" to all friends around the world to
show our solidarity and sympathy for the victims of the riots and chaos in
Indonesia last May 13-15.  Many Chinese Indonesian citizens were abused,
tortured and killed.  Their houses and stores were looted and burnt.
Hundreds of Chinese Indonesian girls/women (aged 10-55) were sexually
harassed and gang raped brutally.  Some victims were even raped in front of
their family members or in front of inhuman cheering crowd. Some of them
were even thrown into the fire and burnt to death after being raped.

 Yet, not many actions seem to have been taken to investigate all this or
to help the victims.  And not very many people seem to know or care about
what happened.

 Please help to spread the news and let the world know.  We need help to
get more international attention to help Chinese Indonesians, who are now
living in fear in Indonesia.  Please pass this ribbon around as the symbol
of campaign against human rights violations, injustice, and racism towards
Chinese Indonesians.  Show that we care and may God help us!



=== What Happened in Indonesia between 5/13-15/98 ===

 The following article was posted on 06/12/98 in the Huaren (Chinese
People) Bulletin Board by Indra. A Victim's Account of Rapes and Murders
Here I post a victim's account of the May tragedy. The original is in
Indonesian, and I did the English translation (forgive some awkwardness in
it). Spread the word around and let the world know what really happened.

English Translation  (beginning of the account)
Name: Vivian (not real) Age: 18 Sex: Female.  Vivian has a little sister
and a brother. She lives in an apartment with her family. At 9.15 am, a
huge crowd had gathered around the apartment. They screamed, "Let's butcher
the Chinese!", "Let's eat pigs!", "Let's have a party!"

 We lived on the 7th floor, and we got a call from a family who lived in
the 3rd floor that the crowd had reached the second floor. They even chased
some occupants upstairs. We were all very frightened. In our fright, we
prayed and left everything in God's hands.

 Afterward, we left our room and went upstairs to the topmost floor, as it
was impossible to go downstairs. We got to the 15th floor, and stayed there
with one of our acquaintances. Not long afterward, we were surprised
because there were some of the crowd coming out of the elevator right
before we entered the room. We hurried into the room and locked the door
tight.

 At that time, we heard them knocked the other rooms' doors loudly, and
there were screams from women and girls. The room was filled with fear.  We
realized that they would come to us. So we spread throughout the room and
hid in corners. Inside, we could heard girls, whose age around 10-12,
screaming, "Mommy... Mommy..." "Mom... Mom... it hurts.."

 That time I didn't know what was happening.  After about half an hour, the
noise diminished, and we had some guts to go out and check. It was
indescribable. A lot, some of them girls, young girls, lied on the floor.

 "O my God, what has happened?" Seeing all of this, my little sister, Veny,
screamed hysterically and hugged her father. Tears started coming down from
my eyes.

 With our acquaintances, a newly-wed couple, we started going downstairs.
Reaching the 10th floor, we heard a scream for help. The scream was very
clear, and we decided to go down and see. But as we turned, we saw a lot of
people. I saw a woman in her 20s being raped by four men. She tried to
fight, but she was held tight.  Realizing the danger, we ran with all our
might. But unfortunately, the mob caught Veny. We tried to rescue her, but
we had to give up.

 There were around 60 of them. They tied us - I, my father, my mother,
Veny, Dony, Uncle Dodi, Aunt Vera--with ripped sheet. They led us to a
room. Uncle Dodi asked what they wanted, but they didn't answer. They cast
an evil and savage look. One of them grabbed Veny rudely and dragged  her
to a sofa.

 At that time, I knew that she was in danger. I screamed loudly, and one of
the mob slapped me. My father who also screamed was hit by a wooden block,
and he  fainted. My mother had fainted when Veny was dragged to the sofa. I
could only pray and pray that the disaster would not befall us...

 Uncle Dodi kept trying to persuade them by offering money, but the effort
was fruitless. And in the end they forcedly raped Veny. Not able to stand
all of this anymore, I cried and closed my eyes. There were about 5 people
who raped Veny, and before beginning, everyone always said, "Allahu akbar"
(and Islamic phrase in Arabic, meaning "God is the greatest"). They were
ferocious, brutal.

 Not long afterward, around 9 men came to the room and dragged me. I also
had a chance to see them forcing and dragging Aunt Veny. But, instantly
fainted and everything was blank. I became conscious at around 5 or 6 in
the afternoon. My head was in pain, and then I realized that I had no
clothes on my body. I cried.

 I was very depressed. I realized that my family were still there, and
obscurely I saw my father hugged my mother and Doni. I also saw that Uncle
Dodi was lying on the floor, and Uncle Vera was crying over his body.

 I felt so weak, and fainted again.

 The next day, I was in the Pluit Hospital. My mother and father were
beside me. With all the pains on my body, I asked, "Mom, why Vinny, Mom?" I
felt a stinging pain as I said those words. I felt my cheek swollen. My
mother instantly cried and couldn't speak any words, while my father,
holding histears, managed to smile.

 After 4 days in treatment, my condition started getting better. With a sad
look, my father then told me what happened. After I fainted, 7 people raped
me. At that time my father still couldn't see well after being hit with the
block. They raped me by rolling my body and hit it against the wall. Then,
my father said to me, "Vin, Venny has gone..." I was confused and instantly
cried loudly. "Why, Dad?" My father didn't answer. He told me to rest and
went out of the room. I cried over and over again, feeling that my life is
worthless anymore.

 A week ago, after I had been able to gone home, I was told everything that
happened. When she was raped, Veny kept fighting, and so she was slapped
repeatedly by her rapists. The last time she fought, Veny spitted on one of
them. Offended, the man grabbed a knife and stabbed it to Veny's stomach.
Brutally, he did it repeatedly until Veny drew her last breath with blood
all over her.

 After I heard the story, I was shocked. My father then said that Uncle
Dodi had  the same fate, watched by Aunt Vera who is also a victim of the
rape. God... why should all of this happen? Now Aunt Vera stays in her
parents' house, accompanied by her sister. According to what the sister
said, she is still shocked. Her face is blank, and often she refuses to
eat.

 Almost every hour, my mother and I cry over this tragedy. I couldn't ever
forget it. No matter what, they (the mob) are uncivilized people who have
no sense of humanity. (end of the account)



=== Horrible Crime Picture on the Web ===

 Please note horrible photos of the riots can be found in:
<http://members.tripod.com/~moyu11/>,
<http://members.theglobe.com/dindonesia/>,
<http://members.theglobe.com/Dindonesia/picture.htm>, and
<http://www.nease.net/~sunfish/blood/riots_pic.htm>

 These are live evidences (among others) of Indonesians' "Holocaust" - an
organized appalling crimes against all civilized human beings (not just a
certain group of ethnic people), and thereby, should be condemned by all
civilized humans and countries.  Please feel free to access and ftp to your
own web sites and help distribute them to all civilized humans and let them
know what's happening.  That's one of ways of effectively stop such
inhumane crimes, punish those animal-like, Stalin-Nazis style criminals,
and prevent it from ever happening again (Look at what Jewish people have
done successfully to help their "holocaust" victims, worth our attention
and effort to learn from them). -- Pat Wang, Boston, MA



=== Attacks on Ethnic Chinese in Indonesia -- What You Can Do ===

<http://www.hrw.org/hrw/campaigns/indonesia/todo-ind.htm>

 Since the beginning of the current crisis in Indonesia, Human Rights Watch
has received hundreds of appeals for help every week from people around the
world who are concerned about recent violence against Chinese-Indonesians.
Of particular concern are reports of rapes of ethnic Chinese women during
the May 13-14 riots.  Despite the efforts of non-governmental organizations
in Jakarta, there is a clear concern that not enough is being done by the
Indonesian government to investigate the allegations, to offer assistance
to victims, or to prevent such abuse in the future.  A prompt official
acknowledgment of the gravity of the allegations, the trauma of the
victims, and the need to undertake a thorough and sensitive investigation
is crucial.

 As a first step, Human Rights Watch advises concerned individuals to send
letters to Indonesia's National Human Rights Commission (Komisi Nasional
Hak Asasi Manusia Indonesia or KOMNAS-HAM ) to give particular attention to
this issue and to establish safe and confidential mechanisms to investigate
the reported rapes.

 Komnas itself has suggested that rioting might have been instigated, but
even if attacks on ethnic Chinese were carried out without the knowledge of
the Indonesian government, failure to thoroughly investigate the reports
would make the government complicit, by negligence or omission, in a grave
human rights violation.

 In the course of such an inquiry, the Indonesian government must make
every effort to protect the identities of rape victims in order to prevent
further victimization through reprisals or stigmatization; it should ensure
that women receive appropriate medical and psychological care, as well as
legal assistance for those who wish to pursue prosecution of their
attackers.

 Letters urging the Indonesian government to take these important steps can
be sent directly to President Habibie with copies to local Indonesian
embassies, and to the Jakarta office of KOMNAS-HAM.

 The voice of the international community is also critical:

 Concerned individuals living outside Indonesia should appeal to their own
governments through parliamentarians (in the U.S., members of Congress) to
press the Indonesian authorities to investigate these reports.

 Indonesia's international donors must press Indonesia to ensure human
rights accountability as a key to the country's political reform.  They
should be urged to raise two issues in particular during the annual meeting
of the Consultative Group on Indonesia (CGI) when it meets in Paris on July
29-30, 1998: the anti-Chinese violence and the disappearance of political
activists.
