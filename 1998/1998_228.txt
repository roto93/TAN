Dear colleague, we would appreciate if you could bring the attached
advertisement to the attention of interested candidates.  (Sorry to
bother you via email, but the ad was unfortunately omitted in the November
issues of the AAS Job Bulletin and Physics Today).

Sincerely, Wil van Breugel (wil@igpp.llnl.gov).

               POSTDOCTORAL POSITIONS IN ASTROPHYSICS 

               LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY
               Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics
               P.O. Box 808
               Department AJAHAF8PH
               Livermore, CA 94551-0808

               Attention: Clea Marples 

------------------------------------------------------------------------


The Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics (IGPP) at Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory (LNLL) has several postdoctoral positions
available in its astrophysics program starting in the fall of 1999.

Successful candidates will conduct a vigorous and significant program of
cutting-edge research. Postdoctoral fellows at IGPP will have access to
LLNL's unique resources, University of California Lick Observatory and,
in collaboration with IGPP staff members or UC faculty, Keck Observatory.
Applicants' fields of research may be in any area of astrophysics,
but preference will be given to candidates whose research directions
overlap with those currently being pursued by IGPP staff (see below).

A description of ongoing astrophysics research at IGPP may be found
in the AAS Bulletin Observatory Reports. Other informative activities
include the planned meeting of `Imaging the Universe in Three Dimensions:
Astrophysics with Advanced Multiwavelength Devices' to be held in
Walnut Creek, CA March 29 - April 1 1999 (for information see our
website `http://www-igpp.llnl.gov/conf/conference.html' or send email
to 3Dconf@llnl.gov).

IGPP has a large network of SUN workstations and access to LLNL's
supercomputer and image processing facilities. All major astronomical
image analysis programs are available. The IGPP hosts collaborators
from all campuses of University of California and has an extensive
postdoctoral and visitor program. The IGPP postdoctoral appointments
will be for 1-3 year terms. Salary is $42,000/yr with excellent fringe
benefits, and adequate travel support will be made available.

Applications may be made at any time, but serious consideration will
commence 15 January 1999. Applicants should send a curriculum vitae,
bibliography, three letters of recommendation, a summary of previous and
current research, and a description of their planned research program
to Clea Marples at the above address.  For further information, please
contact Dr. Wil van Breugel at IGPP, phone (510) 422-7195, fax (510)
423-0238, or by email: wil@sundial.llnl.gov. AAE/EOE.

PS. Several staff members from our institute will be at the AAS meeting 
Jan 5 - 9 in Austin, Texas. We would be interested to talk to postdoc 
applicants, which would be most efficient if we would receive applications 
before Jan 4.
