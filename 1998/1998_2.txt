Comments by KYL:

The plan that Darwin put up for discussion was largely patterned on a
scheme adopted by the UK funding agency - PPARC that I introduced to
him and Tzihong Chiueh.  The scheme works if there is sufficient funding,
and a fair and speedy review.

As I indicated to Darwin privately, I do not see how the AS contribution
can be implemented in practice, since the AS is not set up as a funding 
agency for the general scientific community here.  I would expect any
such scheme will have to involve an agreement between the AS president
and the chair of the NSC about the funding of the proposed AS
contribution.  One should not forget that the source of NSC funding
and AS funding is the same government Treasury and therefore ask whether
the proposed AS contribution is unnecessary complication or not.

This is in fact a key issue. Darwin proposed having the amount set at
the total requests to the NSC last year plus prorated Physics increase.
This of course does not take into account the rapid increase in the
astronomical community here.

It is always easy to promise fast turn around if someone else is supposed
to do all the work.
