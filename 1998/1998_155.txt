Subject: UNDERSTATED EXPOSURE TIMES IN HST EXPOSURE CATALOG FOR CYCLE 8 CALL FOR PROPOSALS

Due to an oversight in the creation of our Planned Archived
Exposures Catalog, some targets were listed with significantly
less exposure time than they will actually have. Approximately 70
targets were affected with the actual planned exposures listed 
underestimated by a factor of 5 or more. The list of targets can
be obtained from the PAEC URL (http://archive.stsci.edu/paec.html).

If you plan to propose to observe ANY targets that already have 
PLANNED observations, please consult our re-created PAEC at the 
URL listed above or the StarView duplication checking screen for 
the revised total exposure times.

Sorry for any inconvenience this oversight may have created.
