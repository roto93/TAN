Held in July, this conference in honor of Mike Disney's 60th birthday was
invigorating, fun, and well attended.  I expected fun and invigoration in
Wales, but was pleasantly surprised at the number of people who had the
good sense to show up.  This does enormous credit to Mike and all the others
who have worked so long and hard there, most especially Steve Phillipps
and conference organizer Jon Davies.

In spite of the generous amount of time well spent sampling Welsh hospitality,
and the occasional interruptions for Mike to harangue the speaker, an
enormous amount of science was discussed.
The number of interesting issues is indicated by the long if not comprehensive
list of contentious assertions compiled during the conference:  47 items in
all.  Some were profound and some were silly, but to try to say which were
which would only invite further debate.

To my mind, two subjects really stood out.  One was the announcement by
Armandroff and independently by Karachentsev courtesy of Huchtmeier of the
discovery of new Local Group dwarfs around M31, as reported in the last issue
of Dwarf Tales.  The other was the great progress made in optically blind HI
surveys, such as the Aricebo strip survey discussed by Frank Briggs and
Martin Zwaan and the impressively large HIPASS project described by
Rachel Webster and many others too numerous to name here.
These HI surveys promise to provide an enormous amount of information about
the faint end of both the HI mass function and the optical surface brightness
distribution.  They are beginning to place rather restrictive limits on the
mass density of Malin-1 analogs and gas disks completely devoid of stars.
As Ken Freeman reminded us, this raises a concern:  we know of disks which
are almost entirely gaseous with only a few stars; why are there none with
no stars at all?

I think the new Local Group dwarfs (and many other results I haven't even
touched upon) teach a positive lesson for the survey astronomers in all of us:
if you look hard enough, you will find something new and interesting.  Mike has
been trying to tell us this for years; perhaps we should learn to trust him.
If Mike tells you he knows of a beautiful coastal walk with a comfortable
pub at the end, you should definitely trust him.  If he tells you he knows
the tides and it is safe to walk along the beach, you definitely should
{\bf not} trust him.

{\large{ \bf Scientific Motivation}}

 Our knowledge of galaxy dynamics has made big steps in recent years.
From a theoretical point of view, numerical simulations, with always
increasing computing power, are more and more precise, and include
several essential phenomena, such as gas hydrodynamics, or star
formation and feedback in N-body problems.  From an observational
point of view, the high spatial resolution provided by HST and the new
generation of big telescopes on the ground, beginning with the Keck,
have made possible new discoveries on internal dynamics (galaxy
nuclei), and high-redshift evolution. The aim of this conference is to
develop the two aspects, to summarize the advances already gained on
the topic of galaxy dynamics, and to emphasize the unsolved problems
and new directions to investigate with future large instruments (such
as VLT, LSA, NGST), as well as with the new generation of
supercomputers.


High resolution observations reveal a much larger frequency of galaxy
interactions in the past, it is even possible to trace back the 
importance of internal dynamics, such as bar instabilities in disks, 
bulge formation through merger or secular evolution, and in all
internal and external processes, the influence of gas and stellar
dynamics. One of the highlights is that galaxies in the past are
smaller than today, which suggests a continuous evolution, in terms of
galaxy mergers for bulges and ellipticals, or mass accretion for disks.
Evolution appears more rapid in galaxy clusters, where the galaxy
density speeds up the interaction effects. The distant clusters have 
a disk fraction much larger than the present ones, and spectacular
tidally-triggered starbursts, which quantify the relative roles
of nature and nurture in their morphological segregation.


These observational results can now be confronted to theoretical
predictions about the evolution of galaxy morphology, or the evolution
of the Hubble sequence itself. The physics of galaxies being highly
non-linear, most advances in the domain are from numerical simulations.
 In particular, the dynamical coupling between the gaseous, stellar
and non-baryonic components, has revealed new phenomena: dynamical
instability of disks, radial mass transfers, secular building of
bulges... A galaxy does not remain frozen in a given morphological type,
but evolves in a Hubble time and sweeps all the morphological sequence.
In the future, it would be possible to tackle dynamical evolution
time-scales, and the implied cosmic history of star formation.

\noindent
\bigskip

The main topics addressed will be:

\begin{itemize}
\item Bars and circumnuclear disks dynamics
\item Dark matter and gas accretion
\item Formation and evolution of disks
\item Formation of bulges and early-type galaxies
\item Galaxy interactions and merging
\item Dynamical effects on galaxies in clusters
\item Hubble sequence evolution
\item Theoretical and instrumental perspectives

B,R, and J frames taken with the Calar Alto 3.5m telescope of the
dwarf irregular galaxy UGC 685 are presented. The brightest part of
the stellar population is resolved in B and R, very few also in J. The
stellar color-magnitude diagram is discussed.  An estimate of the
distance to UGC 685 of $5.5$ Mpc is derived based on the brightest
blue supergiant stars. Most of the resolved bright stars show colors
in the range $-0.1 \le B-R \le +0.7$. The continuum light of the
unresolved stars is distributed rather regular in B, R, and J, showing
only minor irregularities. This surface brightness distribution
follows an exponential law in all three colors with a scale length
$r_c = 0.33$ kpc. The central surface brightnesses are $21.57 \pm 0.09
mag/\Box''$, $20.65 \pm 0.06mag/\Box''$, and $20.11 \pm 0.11
mag/\Box''$, in B, R, and J, respectively. The surface brightness can
be traced out to 5 $r_c$ in B and R. Thus, UGC 685 belongs to the
class of dwarfs where the HI distribution is much more extended (here
2.6 times) than the optical (stellar) light distribution, but contrary
to many objects of this type, it does not belong to the class of
low-surface brightness objects. The overall colors are $B-R = + 0.97$,
$B-J = +1.55$ and the magnitude is B = 14.55 ($M_B^o$ = -14.5). The
classification as an irregular dwarf results from the few HII regions
of UGC 685. On an H${\alpha}$ Calar Alto 2.2m telescope CCD image, I
identified only 5 HII regions. The total H${\alpha}$ flux corresponds
to a mildly on-going star formation with a rate of 0.003 \Msun
yr$^{-1}$, a low rate even in comparison to other dwarfs. The
available data do not indicate any major deviation from this rather
low star formation rate within the last $10^9$ yr.

We examine the stellar content of 10 dwarf irregular galaxies of which
broad-band CCD photometry was published in Hopp \& Schulte-Ladbeck
(1995).  We also present H$_{\alpha}$ images for several of these
galaxies.  The galaxies in the sample are located outside of the Local
Group.  Yet, they are still close enough to be resolved into single
stars from the ground but only the brightest stars (or star clusters)
are detected and there is severe crowding. The sample galaxies were
selected to be isolated from massive neighbors; about half of them are
(mostly peripheral) members of groups, the other half is located in
the field. We discuss the vicinity of the sample galaxies to other
dwarf galaxies.

In order to interpret single-star photometry and draw conclusions
about the stellar content or other distance-dependent quantities, it
is crucial that accurate distances to the galaxies be known. The
distances to the sample galaxies are not well known since all but one
have not had a primary distance indicator measured. We make an attempt
to constrain the distances by identifying the envelope of the
brightest supergiants in B, B-R and R, B-R color-magnitude diagrams,
but the results are not very accurate (we estimate the minimal error
on the distance modulus is 1.36$^m$). Nevertheless, the fact that the
sample galaxies are resolved with direct ground-based imaging
indicates that they are sufficiently nearby to represent good
candidates for observations with instruments that provide high spatial
resolution, e.g., adaptive optics systems on large ground-based
telescopes, or the Hubble Space Telescope.

We discuss the morphologies, color-magnitude diagrams and frequencies
of the resolved stars together with the morphology of the ionized gas,
as well as the surface brightness profiles and colors of the
underlying light distributions of unresolved stars. We point out the
occurrence in half of the galaxies studied of HII regions and young
stellar associations located well outside of the main body of resolved
stars. This appears to be in conflict with the hypothesis of
self-propagating star-formation. All of the sample galaxies contain
HII regions and young massive stars with ages of a few Myr to around
10~Myr. For supergiants beyond an age of about 50~Myr, incompleteness
is already a problem in the single-star photometry. However, we can
also gain insight into the stellar content from the integrated colors
of the unresolved stars.  The light distribution of the unresolved
stars is more extended than that of the resolved stars and is of a
more regular and elliptical shape. We provide ellipticities, central
surface brightnesses and scale lengths for the sample galaxies. The
background-light colors indicate a range of star-formation histories
for the sample galaxies, with galaxy colors at one extreme being
dominated by the old, metal-poor population, and at the other extreme,
by the most recent star-birth event. The results provide insight into
the stellar content and the star-formation histories of isolated,
late-type galaxies.\par

We investigate the chemical properties of M32, the bulges of M31
and the Milky Way, and the dwarf spheroidal galaxies NGC 205, NGC
185, Sagittarius, and Fornax using previously published oxygen
abundances for their planetary nebulae.  Our principal result is
that the mean stellar oxygen abundances for all of these galaxies
correlate very well with their mean velocity dispersions.  This
implies that the balance between energy input from type II
supernovae and the gravitational potential energy controls how far
chemical evolution proceeds in bulges, ellipticals, and dwarf
spheroidals.  It appears that chemical evolution ceases once
supernovae have injected sufficient energy that a galactic wind
develops.  All of the galaxies follow a single relation between
oxygen abundance and luminosity, but the dwarf spheroidals have
systematically higher [O/Fe] ratios than the other galaxies.
Consequently, dynamically hot galaxies do not share a common star
formation history nor need they share a common chemical evolution,
despite attaining similar mean stellar oxygen abundances when
forming similar stellar masses.  The oxygen abundances support
previous indications that the stars in higher luminosity
ellipticals and bulges were formed on a shorter time scale than
their counterparts in less luminous systems.  We calibrate the
Mg$_2$ index for dynamically hot galaxies as a function of
observed age and oxygen abundance using the mean oxygen abundances
from the planetary nebulae and the best age estimates available
for the stars in M32 and the bulges of M31 and the Milky Way.

We present an analysis of the deepest pure-UV observations 
with the highest angular resolution ever performed, a set of 
12 exposures with the HST WFPC2 and F160BW filter obtained in 
parallel observing mode, which cover $\sim$12 square arcminutes in the LMC,
North of the bar and in the ``general field'' regime of the LMC. 
The 341 independent measurements of 198 
objects represent an accumulated exposure of $\geq$2 10$^4$ sec 
and reveal stars as faint as m$_{UV}\simeq$22 mag. The observations
 show that $\sim$2/3 of the UV emission from
the LMC is emitted by our HST-detected UV stars in the field, {\it i.e.,
not} in clusters or associations.
We identified optical counterparts in the ROE/NRL
photometric catalog for $\sim$ 1/3 of the objects. 
The results are used to discuss the nature of these UV sources, to estimate
the diffuse UV emission from the LMC as a prototype of dwarf 
galaxies, and to evaluate the contamination by field
stars of UV observations of globular and open clusters in the LMC. We find
that the projected density of UV stars in the general field of the
LMC is a few times higher than in the Galactic disk close to the Sun.
Combining our data with observations by UIT allows us to define the
stellar UV luminosity function from m$_{UV}$=8 to 18 mag, and to confirm
that the field regions in the LMC have been forming stars at a steady
rate during the last 1 Gyr, with an IMF close to the Salpeter law.

We present $^{12}$CO $1 \rightarrow 0$ observations of eleven low
luminosity (M$_B$ $>-18$), HI--rich dwarf galaxies.  Only the three
most metal-rich galaxies, with 12+log(O/H)$\approx$ 8.2, are detected.
Very deep CO spectra of six extremely metal-poor systems
(12+log(O/H)$\le$7.5) yield only low upper limits on the CO surface
brightness, $I_{CO}<0.1$ K km s$^{-1}$.  Three of these six have never before
been observed in a CO line, while the others now have much more
stringent upper limits.  For the very low metallicity galaxy Leo~A, we
do not confirm a previously reported detection in CO, and the limits
are consistent with another recent nondetection.

We combine these new observations with data from the literature to form
a sample of dwarf galaxies which all have CO observations and measured
oxygen abundances.  No known galaxies with 12+log(O/H)$<$7.9
($Z<0.1Z_\odot$) have been detected in CO.  Most of the star-forming
galaxies with higher (12+log(O/H)$>$8.1) metallicities are detected at
similar or higher I$_{CO}$ surface brightnesses.  The data are consistent
with a strong dependence of the I$_{CO}$/M$_{H_2}~\equiv~X_{CO}$ conversion
factor on ambient metallicity.  The strikingly low upper limits on some
metal-poor galaxies lead us to predict that the conversion factor is
non-linear, increasing sharply below $\sim$1/10 of the solar
metallicity (12+log(O/H)$\leq$7.9).

We report the detection of WC stars in five Wolf-Rayet (W-R) galaxies:
He 2-10, NGC 3049, NGC 3125, NGC 5253 and Tol 89.  The faint broad
{C\,{\sc iv} $\lambda$5808} line requires sufficiently high S/N ($\ge$
40) to be detected explaining the non-detection of this WC feature in
previous observations.  From the measurement of W-R emission lines
(N\,{\sc iii} $\lambda$4640 + C\,{\sc iii} $\lambda$4650, He\,{\sc ii}
$\lambda$4686, and C\,{\sc iv} $\lambda$5808), we conclude that all
W-R regions contain a mixed population of WNL, and early WC stars. The
exception is the high-metallicity region NGC~3049 where late WC stars
prevail.

A spatial offset between the multiple peaks of the nebular emission
and the stellar light in He 2-10 and Tol 89 is observed.  These
nebular emission structures are likely due to the existence of bubbles
and loops, owing to the injection of mechanical energy in the ISM
through the W-R winds and/or supernovae.  Due to age differences and
likely smaller energy deposition the structures around the W-R regions
are possibly smaller than the ones predominantly energized by SNe.
The spatial distribution of W-R stars closely follows the stellar
continuum with no significant distinction between WNs and WCs
distributions.

From the luminosity of the W-R signatures we have estimated the
absolute number of W-R stars of the different subtypes. The WC/WN
number ratios have typical values between 0.2 -- 0.4, and show no
clear trend with metallicity.  For low-metallicity objects ($Z \sim
1/5 Z_\odot$), these values are larger than the observed WC/WN ratios
in Local Group objects, but are compatible with expectations for star
forming events with short duration if stellar evolution models with
high mass loss are used.
 
We derive ages for the starburst regions in the range of 3 to 6 Myr
and confirm that the burst duration must not exceed $\sim$ 2--4 Myr to
account for the high population of W-R stars observed in starburst
regions, even if emission line stars similar to those observed in R136
and NGC~3603 are common in starbursts.  Within the uncertainties the
majority of the observed quantities is reasonably reproduced by models
with a Salpeter IMF.  Although some W-R lines in few regions are
stronger than predicted by the models no clear case requiring a
significantly flatter IMF is found.  IMF slopes much steeper than
Salpeter may, however, not be compatible with our data.

We simulate the dynamical, chemical, and spectro-photometric evolution 
of dwarf and normal elliptical galaxies embedded in a dark matter halo, 
using a three-dimensional $N$-body/SPH simulation code. For the forming 
dwarf elliptical galaxies, supernova-driven winds propagating 
outwards from inside the system collide with the infalling gas and 
produce the super-shell in which stars are formed.   
The resulting stellar system forms a loosely bound virialized system
due to the significant mass loss and has a large velocity dispersion 
and a large core. Consequently the surface brightness distribution shows
an exponential profile and the color distribution shows a {\it positive}
gradient such that the colors become redder away from the galaxy center 
in agreement with observations. 
On the other hand, for the normal elliptical galaxies with deep 
gravitational potential, the mass loss out of the system does not have a 
significant dynamical effect on the stellar system. The resulting surface 
brightness distribution has a large central concentration like 
de Vaucouleurs' $r^{1/4}$-profile and the color distribution shows a
{\it negative} gradient as observed. Our simulation shows that different 
features between dwarf and normal elliptical galaxies stem from different 
cooling efficiencies for their respective protogalaxies in a standard 
CDM universe.

Based on film copies of the POSS-II we inspected a wide area of

\{RA = 18$^{\rm h}$ 38$^{\rm m}$, D = $+18^{\circ}$, V$_0<$ 1500

candidates which have angular diameters $\geq0.5^{\prime}$ and a mean
surface brightness $\leq26$ mag/$\Box^{\prime\prime}$. Of them 22 are
in the direction of the Local Void region. To measure their redshifts,
a HI survey of these objects is undertaken on the 100 m Effelsberg

We have studied the relation between HI linewidth and optical
luminosity in two samples of dwarf galaxies, with special attention to
the accuracy of the inclination correction.  The first sample consists
of rotationally supported galaxies, and has DDO~154 as a
prototype. They have HI linewidths significantly larger than predicted
by an extrapolation of the Tully-Fisher relation.  The deviation from
the extrapolated Tully-Fisher relation correlates with the
distance-independent mass-to-lumino\-sity ratio $M_{\rm HI}/L_{\rm
B}$.  The baryonic correction for these gas rich galaxies is too small
to explain the deviation from the Tully-Fisher relation, unless a
small mass-to-light ratio $(M/L_{\rm B})_* \le 0.25$ for the stellar
population is assumed.  The second sample contains dwarf galaxies with
comparable rotational and random velocities. This sample, having Leo A
as a prototype, is consistent with an extrapolation of the classical
Tully-Fisher relation to lower luminosities. These dwarf galaxies are
not particularly rich in gas, but their mass is dominated by baryonic
matter within their HI radius.  We suggest that any evolution of the
deviating galaxies towards the Tully-Fisher relation will combine a
decrease in linewidth by radial transport of HI with an increase in
luminosity due to a larger accumulated stellar mass.

We model the effects of repeated supernova explosions from starbursts
in dwarf galaxies on the interstellar medium of these
galaxies, taking into account the gravitational potential of their
dominant dark matter haloes.  We explore supernova rates from one every
30,000 yr to one every 3 million yr, equivalent to steady mechanical
luminosities of $L=0.1-10 \times 10^{38}$~ergs~s$^{-1}$, occurring in
dwarf galaxies with gas masses $M_g=10^6 - 10^9 M_\odot$.  We address
in detail, both analytically and numerically, the following three
questions: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item When do the supernova ejecta blow out of the disk of the galaxy?
\item When blowout occurs, what fraction of the interstellar gas is
blown away, escaping the potential of the galactic halo?
\item What happens to the metals ejected from the massive stars of the
starburst?  Are they retained or blown away?
\end{enumerate}
We give quantitative results for when blowout will or will not occur
in galaxies with $10^6 \leq M_g \leq 10^9 M_\odot$.  Surprisingly, we
find that the mass ejection efficiency is very low for galaxies with
mass $M_g \geq 10^7 M_\odot$.  Only galaxies with $M_g \lesssim 10^6
M_\odot$ have their interstellar gas blown away, and then virtually
independently of $L$.  On the other hand, metals from the supernova
ejecta are accelerated to velocities larger than the escape speed from
the galaxy far more easily than the gas. We find that for $L_{38}=1$, only
about 30\% of the metals are retained by a $10^9 M_\odot$ galaxy, and
virtually none by smaller galaxies. We discuss the
implications of our results for the evolution, metallicity and
observational properties of dwarf galaxies.

We measure the HII--region oxygen and nitrogen abundances for 14
star-forming emission line galaxies (ELGs) at intermediate redshifts
($0.11<z<0.5$) using optical spectra obtained with the Keck II
telescope and LRIS multi-object spectrograph.  The target galaxies
exhibit a range of metallicities from slightly metal-poor like the LMC
(12+log(O/H)$\simeq$8.4) to super-solar (12+log(O/H)$\simeq$9.05) where
the solar value is 12+log(O/H)$\simeq$8.89.  Oxygen abundances of the
sample correlate strongly with rest--frame blue luminosities.  The
metallicity--luminosity relation based on these 14 objects is formally
indistinguishable from the one obeyed by galaxies in the local
universe, although there is marginal evidence (1.1$\sigma$) that the
sample is slightly more metal-deficient than local galaxies of the same
luminosity.  The observed galaxies exhibit smaller emission linewidths
than local galaxies of similar metallicity, but proper corrections for
inclination angle and other systematic effects are unknown.  For 8 of
the 14 objects we measure nitrogen-to-oxygen (N/O) ratios.  Seven of
the 8 systems show evidence for secondary nitrogen production, with
$log(N/O)>-1.4$ similar to local spiral galaxies.  These chemical
properties are inconsistent with unevolved objects undergoing a first
burst of star formation.  Comparison with local galaxies showing
similar chemical properties suggests that these intermediate$-z$
objects contain substantial old stellar populations which were
responsible for the bulk of the heavy element production presently seen
in the ionized gas.

Four of the 14 galaxies exhibit small half-light radii and narrow
emission line profiles (Compact Narrow Emission Line Galaxies---CNELGs;
Koo et al.\ 1995) consistent with small dynamical masses despite their
large optical luminosities and high levels of chemical enrichment.  We
find that the four CNELGs are indistinguishable from the 10 other
emission line galaxies (ELGs) in the sample on the basis of their
metallicity and luminosity alone.   Because of their morphological
similarity to HII and spheroidal galaxies, CNELGs have been proposed
as the starburst progenitors of today's spheroidals.  Our assessment of
the stellar chemical abundances in nearby spheroidals reveals that the
majority of the CNELGs are presently $\sim$4 magnitudes brighter
and $\sim$0.5 dex more metal-rich than the bulk of the stars in well-known metal-poor
dwarf spheroidals such as NGC~205 and NGC~185.  Two of the four CNELGs
exhibit oxygen abundances higher than the planetary nebula oxygen
abundances in NGC~205, making an evolution between these two CNELGs and
metal-poor dwarf spheroidals highly improbable.   However, the data
are consistent with the hypothesis that more luminous and metal-rich
spheroidal galaxies like NGC~3605 may become the evolutionary endpoints
of some CNELGs after 1 to 3 magnitudes of fading.  We suggest that the
$z=0.1-0.4$ ELGs, and perhaps some of the CNELGs, are the precursors to
today's spiral galaxies during an episode of vigorous bulge star
formation $\sim$5 Gyr ago.

The photometric estimate of the metallicity and the age of the
Azzopardi et~al.\ (1991) carbon stars (Ng 1997) is revised to
respectively \mbox{Z\muspc$\simeq$\muspc0.004} and
\mbox{$\sim$\muspc0.1~Gyr}.  Under the hypothesis that the carbon
stars are located at a distance related to the Sagittarius dwarf
galaxy, the broad velocity dispersion of the stars can only be
explained if they were formed out of Galactic material during a recent
crossing of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy through the Galactic plane.

The possibility that the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal might have
formed as a Searle--Zinn fragment in the outer halo of the Galaxy is
discussed. Arguments in favor of this hypothesis are: (1) The
luminosity distribution of globular clusters in both Sagittarius and
in the outer halo (R$_{\rm gc} > 80$ kpc), appear to be bimodal with
peaks near M$_{\rm V} \sim -5$ and M$_{\rm V} \sim -10$, and (2) the
globular clusters in both Sgr, and in the outer halo, have a
significantly larger age spread than do the globulars in the inner
halo of the Galaxy. However, a counter argument is that only one of
the four globulars associated with Sgr has the large half--light
diameter that is diagnostic of outer halo clusters. The absence of
globular clusters from all Local Group dwarf spheroidal galaxies
fainter than M$_{\rm V} = -12$ shows that their specific globular
cluster frequency must be lower than it is in the Fornax dwarf
spheroidal. This result suggests that Fornax may have had an unusual
evolutionary history.  \par

The specific globular cluster frequencies ($S_N$) for 24 dwarf
elliptical (dE) galaxies in the Virgo and Fornax Clusters and the Leo
Group imaged with the {\it Hubble Space Telescope} are presented.
Combining all available data, we find that for nucleated dEs --- which
are spatially distributed like giant ellipticals in galaxy clusters ---
$\bar{S}_N({\rm dE,N})=6.5\pm1.2$ and $S_N$\ increases with $M_V$, while
for non-nucleated dEs --- which are distributed like late-type
galaxies --- $\bar{S}_N({\rm
dE,noN})=3.1\pm0.5$ and there is little or no trend with $M_V$.  The
$S_N$ values for dE galaxies are thus on average significantly higher
than those for late-type galaxies, which have $S_N < 1$.  This
suggests that dE galaxies are more akin to giant Es than to late-type
galaxies. If there are dormant or stripped irregulars hiding among the
dE population, they are likely to be among the non-nucleated
dEs. Furthermore, the similarities in the properties of the globular
clusters and in the spatial distributions of dE,Ns and giant Es
suggest that neither galaxy mass or galaxy metallicity is responsible for
high values of $S_N$.  Instead, most metal-poor GCs may have formed in
dwarf-sized fragments that merged into larger galaxies.

The main characteristics of a wide photometric survey of the Sgr dwarf
spheroidal galaxy are shortly presented.  V and I photometry has been
obtained for $\sim 90000$ stars toward Sgr and for $\sim 9000$ stars
in a region devoid of Sgr stars (for decontamination purposes).

The full potential of this large database is far from being completely
explored.  Here we present only preliminary results from the analysis
of statistically decontaminated Color Magnitude Diagrams, trying to
set a scheme of the Star Formation History of the Sgr Galaxy. A
scenario is proposed in which star formation in Sgr began very early
and lasted for several Gyr with progressive chemical enrichment of the
Inter Stellar Medium (ISM). Nearly 8 Gyr ago the star formation rate
abruptly decreased, perhaps in coincidence with the event that led to
the gas depletion of the galaxy. A very small rate of star formation
continued until relatively recent times ($\sim 1$ Gyr ago).  \par

Polar--ring galaxies are systems with two nearly orthogonal rotational
axes, and are therefore clearly the result of galaxy--galaxy
interactions. The host galaxies of polar rings are typically gas--poor
early--type systems. The rings themselves, however, are typically
gas--rich, blue, star--forming systems. They have traditionally been
modelled as the remnants of accreted dwarf irregular
galaxies. Published results on the molecular gas content, and nebular
abundances argue against this model. We present H$\alpha$ imaging data
for three polar--ring galaxies, and derive their HII region luminosity
functions. In all three galaxies, the HII region luminosity functions
are much steeper than found for any dwarf galaxy. The slopes are
generally closer to those of Sa galaxies.  Thus the HII region LFs of
polar rings join the ISM abundances in resembling the very
earliest--type spirals galaxies, rather than their supposed dwarf
irregular precursors.

We review the Lyman alpha emission in local star-forming galaxies. In most
cases as already shown by the IUE, the emission is absent or much weaker than
expected. This occurs because Lyman alpha photons can be resonantly scattered
by the neutral gas and destroyed by even very low amounts of dust. However new
Hubble Space Telescope observations (HST) indicate that other factors such as
the velocity structure of the gas play a crucial role. Gas flows are likely to
occur as powered by the kinetic energy released via stellar winds and
supernova. We propose a scenario based on the hydrodynamics of superbubbles
powered by massive bursts of star formation that naturally accounts for the
variety of Lyman alpha line detections in star-forming galaxies. We caution
with the attempts to derive the co-moving star formation rate at high redshift
from Lyman alpha emission searches.

The bulge carbon stars have been a mystery since their discovery
by Azzopardi et~al.\ (1991), because they are about 
2\mag5 too faint to be regarded as genuine AGB stars, if located
inside the metal-rich bulge (\mbox{m{\to}M\muspc=\muspc14\mag5}).
Part of the mystery can be solved if these carbon stars 
are related to the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy (SDG; 
\mbox{m{\to}M\muspc$\simeq$\muspc17\mag0}). 
They are in that case not old and metal-rich,
but young, $\sim$0.1~Gyr, with SMC-like metallicity (Ng 1998).
\hfill\break
The $\sigma_{RV}\!=\!113\pm14$~km s$^{-1}$
(Tyson{\muspc\&\muspc}Rich~1991) 
radial velocity dispersion
of the stars appears to be consistent with 
bulge membership. On the other hand, a similar velocity dispersion
could be the result from an induced star formation event when the
SDG crosses the galactic midplane.
It is suggested that the
carbon stars are tracers of such an event and that they
therefore are located at distances related to the SDG. However,
the majority of the carbon stars are not member of the SDG,
nor are they similar to the C-stars which are member of the SDG.
\hfill\break
The radial velocities can be used to determine a possible membership to
the
SDG. However,
they do not give information about the distance of the stars.
In particular, if the stars are located
at a distance comparable to the SDG.
This implies that only the period-luminosity relation 
(Groenewegen{\muspc\&\muspc}Whitelock 1996) can be used to distinguish 
unambiguously if the carbon stars are located at bulge-like
or SDG-like distances. 
Thus far only carbon stars with reliable periods have been identified 
at a SDG related distance 
(Ng{\muspc\&\muspc}Schultheis 1997, Whitelock 1998).
