Dear Colleagues,

I am leaving Taiwan tomorrow after two and half years of very memorable
stay at NCU.  I have thoroughly enjoyed both academic and private life here;
much of it due to your help and kindness.  I indeed feel rather sad to leave.

I am indebted to many of you and I wish to say big 'THANK YOU' through this
TAN channel.  I do hope we maintain and further strengthen our friendship and
academic cooperation.  After all, Korea is only two and half hours of flight
away.  [Good news is that neither China Air nor Korean Air fly this route,
so it must be safer!]

Following is my new address

Center for Space Astrophysics & 
Department of Astronomy
Yonsei University
Seoul 120-749 Korea

fax)    82-2-313-5033
e-mail) byun@galaxy.yonsei.ac.kr


Best wishes for all of you,

Yong-Ik
