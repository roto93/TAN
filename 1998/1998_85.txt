Subject: A bug fix release of Difmap

This message announces the release of Difmap version 2.3c.

The reason for this release is primarily to fix a significant bug,
as described later in this message. For this reason I strongly
recommend that users of Difmap upgrade to the new version.

A compressed tar file of the new Difmap distribution can be retrieved at:

 ftp://astro.caltech.edu/pub/difmap/difmap2.3c.tar.Z

Unpacking and installation instructions can also be found in the same
place, at URL:

 ftp://astro.caltech.edu/pub/difmap/README

This README file can also be found in the top-level directory the
above tar file.

Alternatively, for those with un-reliable internet connections there
is also a copy of the compressed difmap tar file that has been split
into 14 100k chunks. To take advantage of this, invoke anonymous ftp
to astro.caltech.edu and type:

 ftp> cd pub/difmap
 ftp> get README.split
 ftp> quit
 
Then follow the directions in the README.split file just acquired.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

New features:

  The 'invert' command, which is usually called for you by commands
  such as 'maplot', 'clean' etc, has been modified to be less stubborn
  in its handling of sampling constraints. In previous versions of
  Difmap this command would refuse to continue when presented with
  visibilities that sampled higher spatial frequencies than could be
  Nyquist sampled by the chosen map grid. It then told you how to
  remedy this by either reducing the size of the map pixels or by
  forceably excluding high spatial frequencies using the uvrange
  command.

  In the new version of Difmap, instead of refusing to continue, the
  invert command now makes a map using just those visibilities that
  can be adequately sampled by the chosen map grid. If this results in
  any visibilities being excluded, 'invert' tells you what percentage
  were excluded and what pixel sizes one would have to choose to avoid
  any exclusions.

  Note that it is not necessarily an error to choose a pixel size that
  is too big to sample all of the visibilities. Sometimes this is the
  only practical way to create a map that is large enough to view
  one's field of interest.

  The main reason that I felt compelled to change this right now is
  that the break point at which visibilities are thought to be
  inadequately sampled has changed subtly in the new version of
  Difmap. In the new version I have now taken account of the 2 pixel
  fuzz added to each visibility by the gridding convolution
  function. This is a very subtle change, but existing mapping scripts
  that were setting the uvrange using the precise values needed to
  stop the 'invert' command from complaining, suddenly stopped
  working.  With the new behavior, the complaints are now just
  warnings and the need to use the uvrange command, just to view a
  larger area using larger pixels, is no longer necessary.

  Another minor new feature is the allowance of non-integer uniform
  bin widths (width>=1.0).

The Bug:

  Now we get to the bad news. I am sorry to say that there has been a
  significant bug in Difmap's uniform weighting algorithm ever since I
  upgraded Difmap to support multi-dimensional FITS files. Note that
  maps derived from merge files and maps derived using natural
  weighting won't have been affected by this bug. The affected maps
  are those that have been made using uniform weighting in the FITS
  version of Difmap. Some of these maps may have higher noise levels
  than expected and they may not exhibit the full resolution
  enhancements and beam shape expected from uniform weighting.
  The maps should otherwise be correct.

  The bug involved the accumulation of binned visibility weights in
  one half of a conjugate-symmetric array. When visibilities that lay
  in the omitted half of the array were encountered, their conjugate
  positions in the included half of the array were incorrectly
  computed by switching the sign of the U coordinate but not that of
  the V coordinate. This resulted in some parts of the UV plane being
  overweighted and other parts being underweighted. In fact some of the
  underweighted parts would have been given zero weight except that in
  protecting against divide by zero errors, the gridding function
  substituted unity weights in such supposedly impossible cases.

  Since fixing the bug, some of the CLASS survey has been remapped to
  determine the extent of the problem, and I am happy to say that the
  only differences that were found were the existence of a few
  marginal sources that had previously been just below the noise
  threshold. Over the last two months new data has also been acquired
  and mapped, mainly to test the new behavior of the invert command
  when subjected to visibilities that can't be Nyquist sampled. This
  change involved some significant modifications so I didn't want to
  release Difmap it had been thoroughly exercised in house.
