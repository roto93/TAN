								June 1998

Dear Colleague:

	I am pleased to announce the release of the Hubble Space Telescope 
Cycle 8 Call for Proposals, which invites participation by the international 
astronomical community in the HST General Observer and Archival Research 
Programs.

The present document contains the basic procedural and technical information 
required for HST proposal preparation and submission. This document will be 
available on-line via a link off of the STScI Proposer Web page
    (http://www.stsci.edu/observing/proposing.html)

or can be ordered using the Web Page form or by contacting the STScI Help 
desk via e-mail (help@stsci.edu) or by phone (1-800-544-8125 or 410-338-1082).
It is not being sent automatically to individuals, but it is furnished to 
institutions and libraries.  Additional technical documents, including the 
Instrument Handbooks, are being furnished to institution and libraries, and
also posted on the Web pages.  

Please note that the submission of proposals for this Cycle 8 is 
entirely electronic for GO proposals, and includes paper submission for
AR proposals. The deadline for submission is Friday, September 11, 1998, 
8:00 pm EDT.

The Scientific Instruments offered in Cycle 8 are the Fine Guidance Sensor,
the Wide Field Planetary Camera 2, and the Space Telescope Imaging 
Spectrograph.

Results of the TAC evaluations will be sent out in December 1998, and 
we are looking forward to a very scientifically productive program for this 
cycle.

				Sincerely,


				Robert Williams
				Director
