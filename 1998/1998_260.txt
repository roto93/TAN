Subject: NGST Town Hall Meeting (CORRECTED)

Attend the Next Generation Space Telescope (NGST) Town Hall Meeting,
4:30-6:00, on Tuesday, January 5th, after the SIM session and just
before the AAS Reception. 

Note: The previous message incorrectly stated that the SIRTF session 
      is on Jan. 5. SIM is on Jan. 5, and SIRTF is on Jan. 6.

Moderated by Peter Stockman, the panel will feature Steve Beckwith
(STScI Director), Bernie Seery (NGST Project Manager), John Mather (NGST
Project Scientist), Alan Dressler (Carnegie, HST and Beyond), Rob
Kennicutt (Arizona, NGST External Science Review) and Wayne Van Citters
(NSF, NGST Standing Review Board).

Panelists will discuss plans for the Next Generation Space Telescope as
the project enters the next formal development phase. 

The topics include:
        o Science with NGST
        o Community participation
        o The upcoming competition for NGST designs
        o Progress in key technologies and instrument studies
        o Keeping under the NASA Cost Cap
        o International Contributions

If you can't make it to the Town Meeting, find out more about NGST at
Session 35, The Next Generation Space Telescope, Exhibit Hall 1,
Thursday, January 7, 9:20am-6;30pm.
