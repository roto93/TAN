Dear users,
    Here is an brief introduction of the powerful software CASTEP
in NCHC. For more detailed information of the CASTEP software, please see

And also please give us your suggestion or interest about the
training course of the CASTEP at

      http://www.nchc.gov.tw/RESEARCH/Phys/soft/castep/castep_inv.htm

or just contact me directly: Tel: (03)5776085x347, FAX:(03)5773538

Name: CAmbridge Serial Total Energy Package

Version: 3.5

Categiry: Computational Physics

Installation/Upgrade Records:

   ver. 3.5 1998.07.01 

Description:

CASTEP is a quantum mechanics program developed by the Theory of Condensed
Matter Group in Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge. It finds the
density of electrons and the total energy of a extended systems such as
solid and surfaces. Pseudo potentials are used in CASTEP to represent 
atoms and plane wave basis set is used for expanding electronic wave 
functions. The effect of many-electrons interaction is approximated with a
exchange-correlation potential based on Density Functional Theory. With 
high performance workstations or supercomputers, CASTEP is a robust tools
to simulate microscopic world at atomic scale with high accuracy and
efficiency.
