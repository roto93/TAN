1.  ARECIBO OBSERVATORY WITHSTANDS HURRICANE GEORGES 
    Proposal Deadline Extended to 1 November 1998

Dear Colleague,

As you probably have heard, Puerto Rico was badly hit by Hurricane 
Georges.  Commercial power is out at the Arecibo Observatory, and 
may not be restored for 2 to 4 weeks due to magnitude of repair 
efforts that are ongoing.  The phone system is also largely 
inoperative, although we hope that this service will be restored 
more quickly.  The observatory has become a center for supplying 
water and other services to staff members and their families.

The Observatory has been operating on our emergency generator 
since the hurricane struck.  There was significant damage to 
homes of a number of staff members, but happily no injuries or 
worse.  The Observatory staff have been working hard to restore 
the telescope to full operating condition; it is impressive that 
observations with 47 MHz radar system continued throughout the 
hurricane, and a group of atmospheric scientists obtained some 
rather unique data!  However, there is a lot to do to check out 
the Gregorian system, in which the tertiary support system and 
possibly some of the secondary panels were damaged.  Some sections 
of the 430 MHz waveguide were also distorted, but this system should 
be available within a few days.

Since there has been essentially no email contact with the 
observatory since 22 September 22, it has not been possible for 
observers to obtain information about system status, obtain 
proposal cover sheets, or submit proposals electronically.  For 
this reason, I feel it is appropriate to extend the 1 October 
deadline for proposals for the trimester starting 1 February 1999, 
to 1 November 1998.  I very much hope that we will have email 
and phone contact by mid-October, which should give users a few 
weeks to finalize their proposals.  I am optimistic that we will 
be able to be in full service again as well by that time.

I also think we should all express our appreciation for the 
outstanding efforts on the part of NAIC staff at Arecibo during 
this very difficult time.  I know they are doing everything 
possible to restore the Observatory to full functionality as 
rapidly as possible, while also having to worry about their 
families and homes.

Best Regards,


Paul Goldsmith
Director, National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center
