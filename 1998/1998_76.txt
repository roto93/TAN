                    Trip to Palomar Observatory


04-13-98  Monday

0900  I waited at the "loop" outside of SM for the shuttle to take me to
Palomar. Nothing came. Lee Silver rolled in with his four wheel drive. Talked
with him for half hour about the Center. He had good suggestions.

0930  Called Palomar office and discovered there was no shuttle. Decided to
drive there myself.

1000  Finalize CO paper with Bob. Tomorrow is the deadline for submitting the
paper to the special issue of Chemosphere on CO. We have two papers based on
presentations at the EPA conference in Oregon last Nov. CO is an important but
neglected molecule. The conference and the special issue will wake us up to its
importance.

1100  Started trip to Palomar.

1230  Smooth drive to Lake Elsinore, a small town on FW 15. Lunch break. Toured
the little town that seems to specialized in "antiques". Got an unfinished
rabbit artwork for my daughter --- I will need to paint it and put skin
on it.

0130  Continued to Temecula, Pala (an orange growing town) and from there drove
up to Mt. Palomar. It was cloudy but the sky was high and I could see the top of
the mountains, but not Palomar Observatory which is on a ridge on the other
side of the mountains. Beautiful wild flowers. Strong current in nearby stream.

0400  Arrived at Palomar Observatory after a leisurely drive. There are four
observatories. There is the famous 200 in, followed by 60, 48 and 18 in. They
are located roughly in an ellipse half mile long and quarter mile across. The
lodging for the observers is known as the Monastery, a little two story house.
The name is no longer rigorously true, because there was a female astronomy
grad student there. I checked into my little comfortable room, very much like
a single room in the Athenaeum, but half its size. On the wall there were a
list of Five Commandments, e.g. do not take shower before 1 pm, do not speak
loudly etc ---- all to ensure the owls who work at night have a rest during the
day. The room is cozy, equipped with an electric alarm clock and nearly perfect
blinds that will not let in any light --- no doubt designed by astronomers who
are magicians of light technology.

0430  The clouds started to roll in. Visibility dropped to 50 ft. I took a walk
to the 200 in to look for John Trauger, who came up the previous day to set up
the instrument. I could feel the snow flakes falling on my face. Failed to find
any trace of John --- it turned out he was inside the computer room upstairs
(the Observatory has four floors).

0600  The Mexican housekeeper of the Monastery cooked us a nice meal of lasagna
and eggplant (like the spicy eggplant at Oaktree Inn minus the meat and the
spice). The surprise was the dessert, ice cream cake. The food is definitely
superior to the JPL cafeteria (John agreed) and is comparable to Chandra. There
are all kinds of cookies, snacks, fruits ..., many temptations for someone like
me who is on diet.

0730  Went to 200 in. Check instrument, check weather --- the map from NOAA
GOES satellite was on the web. John explained to me why we need the Coude for
high resolution spectroscopy. Most astronomers use Cassegrain.

I have to explain why we wanted to look for O2 on Venus. Well, here is a short
version of a long story. In 1973 I published my first paper on O2 on Venus with
my classmate Dak Sze and my advisor Mike McElroy. It should be there as part of
the CO2 photochemistry. In 1982 Bill DeMore and I worked out the "complete"
photochemical model of Venus, with substantial amounts of O2. A few yrs later
John Trauger and Jon Lunine made a careful search for O2 and came up with a
limit much lower than the model's. Recently Frank Mill and Dave Crisp made
another search and failed to find it. It is very unsatisfactory to see no
O2 when all models (not just ours) say its should be there. O2 has been
discovered on Mars, and more recently on Ganymede.

Now a decade after John's original measurements, several things have changed.
He has a CCD detector, better filters, better electronics --- giving us a gain
of about 10. Palomar collects 4 times more light than Wilson (where John did
his original work). There is a total gain of 40, the sqrt of which is
about 6. It is worth a shot.

We looked at the satellite map and pray for a clear sky in the morning.

0830  It was too early for bed. With the cold and wind and snow, the Monastery
reminded me of the Wuthering Heights, a God chidden place in the romantic
novel of Emily Bronte. Even the housekeeper appeared like Nellie in the book.
Of course there was no evil servant Joseph, or devilish landlord Heathcliff.
Getting myself into this story mood, I surveyed the collection of books in the
living room. More than half of the books were Victorian classics, published by
Everyman Library, a British publisher. Apparently only people of that
generation read novels. There were at least two copies of Oliver Twist by
Charles Dickens... Anyway all of the books looked extremely familiar to me but
must appeared to be from another world to the students today.

I randomly picked two books, one on the WWII in the Pacific and the other on
the "Jupiter Effect".

0100  Finished the two fascinating books and went to sleep. The latter book read
like science fiction, but then what is science but science fiction a hundred
yrs later. The book said the astrologers were right --- on the influence of
planets on the Earth and human destiny. I agree.


 04-14-98  Tuesday

0700  Up. John was supposed to wake me up at 4 if the sky were clear. There was
heavy snow last night. The place is like a white Christmas. Visibility OK,
sky is clearing.

0800  Took long tour of 200 in. John explained to me in detail how the
telescope worked. How the gears were synchronized mechanically without the
benefit of modern electronics. They would not open the dome even though the sky
was partially clear. There was snow on the dome and opening it might damage the
telescope. John explained to me how the mirror must be resurfaced every few yrs
with Al vapor etc.

Had a philosophical discussion with John on the spiritual beauty of astronomy.
In solitude, in darkness, in communion with the divine lights, the mind is able to
leave all the dust of the real world behind and concentrate on the beauty and
order in the universe. That is how the ultimate scientific truths were revealed
to the masters. That was how Newton was able to connect the laws of heaven and
the Earth. Today we take all that for granted. But where are the mysterious
seductive frontiers of human knowledge today? Is it not in the "dark matter", 90% of the
universe that we knew nothing about except that it possibly exits? Is it not in
the possibility of life elsewhere, where they are looking for us? In short, in
the heavens. I recall an inspiring passage I was reading the previous night:

"In anxious and uncertain times like ours, when it is difficult to find pleasure
in humanity and the course of human affairs, it is particularly consoling to
think of such a supreme and quiet man as Kepler. Kepler lived in an age in which
the reign of law in nature was as yet by no means certain. How great must his
faith in the existence of natural law have been to give him the strength to
devote decades of hard and patient work to the empirical investigation of
planetary motion and the mathematical laws of that motion, entirely on his
own, supported by no one and understood by few!"  Einstein on the 300th
anniversary of Kepler's death, Nov 9, 1930.

Today we are supported by someone (Palomar costs a few millions dollars a yr),
but we are understood by few. Hence, the true reward must be in the work
itself, in the contemplation of the wonders of heaven.

0900  John had a long talk with the Director of Palomar. There was a more
serious problem than the weather. The tertiary mirror on the Coude could not be
held securely in a clutch. This device must be repaired. They had worked
frantically for a few days to get it ready for us, but without success. To take
the whole thing down and fix it properly required six months! We will be out of
action for six months!

Had a long discussion with John on the long term project of observing Venus and
Mars. I told him my new idea of getting the interannual variability of the
atmospheres of planets, the equivalent of El Nino and Quasi Biennial
Oscillations (QBO). These are non-linear coupled modes between radiation,
dynamics and possibly chemistry. A well known example is the dust storm on
Mars, another one is the Quasi Quadriannual Oscillations (QQO) of Jupiter, discovered
by Glenn Orton and Jim Friedsen. In short, I wanted to be the pioneer (Kepler)
of Global Change in the planets. I believe there is no better way to understand
the natural variability of our atmosphere (as opposed to human induced changes)
than studying the planets. Newton brought the laws of heavens to the Earth.
We must expand our view of the Earth to the planets like ours.

John appreciated the significance of my proposal (fantasy) immediately. I assume
by talking to him at 5500 ft from the sea level, in the kingdom where he is
king, my words must sound more persuasive than they would be in Pasadena.
We hatched out a plan to pursue this grand vision --- the details will not be
revealed here without John's permission.

I thanked him for his enthusiastic acceptance of my ideas, and of course for
his unflagging faith in the O2 on Venus. I reminded him the satellite mission
ISO, just before its demise last week, discovered H2O on Titan --- that was
predicted in the paper by Yung, Allen and Pinto in 1984. The press release
mentioned connection of water and life. That was an exciting result. We did
not proposed H2O as a random isolated molecule --- it is the key part of a web
of oxygenated compounds: CO, CO2, H2CO (formaldehyde), CH2CO (ketene) ...
Friends who believe in our theories get rewarded.

1000  John will leave soon. I decide to catch up with reading my students' thesis
complete other chores.

1230  lunch

0200  Lv Palomar Observatory. The road has been cleared by snow plows. Pleasant
drive back with one stop by the stream in Pala.

0500  Travel was smooth. Home in three hrs since leaving Mt. Palomar.

Now I have to face the dust and chores again, hopefully with renewed energy.
