3. GENERAL INFORMATION

Location
--------
   Cheju island is the most famous resort in Korea and is
located in the Nam-hae sea off the southern tip of the Korean 
peninsula. Rugged volcanic mountains, pristine white sand 
beaches and crystal clear water make Cheju one of the few 
unspoiled paradises on earth.
   Sogwipo is a beautiful fishing port on the south coast of 
Cheju island and is renowned for its cultural legacies, lovely 
waterfalls, and recreational facilities. 
   The Symposium will be held at the Hyatt Regency Hotel at 
Sogwipo. This hotel is the highest rank hotel which has very 
good facilities for symposia. It is also located close to the 
sea shore and has commanding panoramic views of the ocean.

Beautiful Korean traditional music will be played.


Visas
-----
   A valid passport is required for entry into South Korea. 
No visa is required for stays of less than 15 days for tourists 
to Cheju island from most countries. Participants from some

your country at least 5 months before the conference date.
If you need any assistance in this matter, do not hesitate to 
contact the LOC.


Abstract Book and Proceedings
-----------------------------
   The abstracts of the poster papers and invited talks are 
published in the abstract book, which will be provided to all 
participants upon registration at the meeting. The abstract book 
is edited by J.S. Kim, H.S. Chung, D.G. Roh, and Y.C. Minh 
(printed at Korea Astronomy Observatory).
   The Symposium proceedings will contain the review and invited 
talks only, and will be published by PASP (ed. Y.C. Minh and E.F. 
van Dishoeck). The participants can reserve additional books for 
US$45 each at the registration desk.


How to Prepare Abstracts
------------------------
   All invited speakers and poster presenters are requested to 
submit abstracts no later than June 1, 1999. Please use the Tex 
macros for IAU 197 Abstracts which you can get either in our WWW 
site or in the anonymous ftp site "hanul.issa.re.kr".
   To get the file, follow these instructions: 

        % ftp hanul.issa.re.kr
        Name: anonymous
        Password: your email address
        ftp> cd pub/iau197/abs_macs
	ftp> prompt
        ftp> mget *
        ftp> quit

   If you have any troubles in getting these macros, please send 
an email to LOC, iau197@hanul.issa.re.kr.
         
   A maximum of TWO pages per abstract is allowed. Please submit 
the Tex-file of your abstract to iau197@hanul.issa.re.kr.
We will also accept the abstract written in the plain ASCII for 
people who may have a difficulty in getting or using the Tex macro.
 
   When your abstract contains a postscript file for figures, then
please follow these instructions:

        % ftp hanul.issa.re.kr
        Name: anonymous
        Password: your email address

	ftp> cd yourname
	ftp> put abstract.tex
        ftp> put fig.ps
        ftp> quit

   Figures should be provided in postscript (Black & white only). 
Please do not send large postscript files by e-mail, but use the 
ftp service instead. In case a figure is not available in 
postscript form, send a clear, original hardcopy, with name and 
title of the contribution written on the back, by regular mail to 
the Symposium address.



4. FINANCIAL SUPPORT

   We hope to be able to provide support to as many participants 
as possible, but the available funds are limited. Only partial 
support will be available. Higher priority will be given to 
requests from young scientists and students.

   The financial support request form is attached at the end. 
The deadline for the application is March 1, 1999, and 
successful applicants will be informed separately before 
March 31, 1999.



5. TRAVEL AND RECREATIONAL FACILITIES

How to get to Cheju Island and to Hyatt Hotel at Sogwipo
--------------------------------------------------------
   Cheju island can be reached conveniently by air through the 
Cheju International Airport. When you book your flight to Korea, 
you are advised to include the domestic portion (from Seoul to 
Cheju). These days, all aviation companies ask an additional 
charge (of about US$40 for one-way between Seoul and Cheju) for 
inclusion of the extra domestic portion.
   You can change planes at Seoul (Kimpo International Airport) 
easily. There are many flights per day (several flights an hour)
from Seoul to Cheju; the duration is about 50 minutes.

   Some major cities of Japan and China also provide direct 
flights to Cheju. Participants from China, Japan, and Korea 
can also reach Cheju island by sea using express Ferry boats. 
These boats will arrive at the Cheju passenger terminal.

   The Hyatt hotel is located at Sogwipo. It takes about 40 
minutes by car from Cheju International Airport and about 50 
minutes from the Cheju passenger terminal to Sogwipo. 
There are many limousines available and we will guide you at 
the airport and the terminal. Please inform us of your 
arrival time before August 1, 1999.


Weather
-------
   Weather is usually fair but very warm during summer. The Hyatt 
hotel is located very close to the sea and the beach, ensuring a 
fresh breeze. Temperatures during the day in August can range 
from 20-30 C. The average is 26 C (79 F) in summer.    
   There are usually 2 or 3 typhoons during the summer, especially 
in July. It is rare to have typhoons at the end of August but with 
good (bad?) luck we may experience an exciting event of nature 
during the symposium. We keep our fingers crossed.


Tours and Recreations
---------------------
   We will arrange a few half-day tours on August 25th 
Wednesday afternoon. Tickets can be bought at the registration 
desk. Other sightseeing tours are also available. Information 
about touristic attractions in Cheju and Korea is available at 
the hotel, and we will arrange tours upon requests. 

   The Cheju island is a famous resort in Korea. The Hyatt hotel 
is situated in the Chungmun Tourism Complex overlooking the 
Pacific Ocean with direct access to the beautiful Chungmun Beach. 
You can also enjoy many resort activities and leisure sports at 
the Sogwipo Hyatt hotel, such as indoor and outdoor swimming, 
golfing, fishing, scuba diving and snorkelling, hiking, cycling, 
rafting, water skiing, wind surfing, hunting, horseback riding, 
visiting farms, ....  Most of the necessary equipment can be 
rented, but reservations to play golf need to be made about a 
month in advance. 
  Participants of this Symposium can stay at the Hyatt hotel 
with the same low rates through Sunday August 29.
