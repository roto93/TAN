Dear Colleagues:

    Attached please find the second announcement of EAMA4 and a 
special message for the potential participants from Taiwan. Some 
simple explanations are needed here.

    First of all, the word EAMA stands for East Asian Meeting on
Astronomy. The number 4 means the 4th meeting. 

    The first meeting of this series was held in at Huang-Shan in 
1990, with the title "Meeting on Star Forming Regions,  under the
sponsorship of Drs. Cai-ping Liu and Norio Kaifu. About 70 participants
from China, Japan and Korea attended the meeting. The second meeting
took place in 1992 at Yusong, Daejon, Korea, co-sponsored by Drs.
Y.K. Minn, Cai-ping Liu and Norio Kaifu. It was called "The Second
North-East Asian Regional Meeting on Recent Development in
Millimeter-wave and Infrared Astronomy", which attracted 100
or so astronomers, mainly from Japan, China, Korea, and also
some from Taiwan. Much of the initial motivation of these meetings 
was to organize the astronomers of East Asia to search for a site for
and eventually toward establishment of a Pan Asian Optical Observatory.i
Therefore, a sit survey team was formed in 1993 and went to Qinghai 
area in China in September, 1993 to conduct site experiments. Dr. 
Wean-shun Tsay of Central University was a member of that site survey 
team. Apart from the above activities, Japanese astronomers have 
organized the Young Astronomers' Summer School in 1993, 1994 and 1995 
to give courses for astronomy students in East Asia countries. Many 
graduate students from Central University took parts in the summer 
school of 1995.

    In the summer of 1995, the third meeting has evolved into a 
full-fledged international conference. It was held in Tokyo with more 
than 200 participants from almost all East and South Asian Countries, 
including China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, 
Thailand, Taiwan, and Vietnam. Australia was also a major country
participating this conference. Even astronomers from Ukraine and 
Bulgaria came. The title of that meeting was "Ground-based Astronomy 
in Asia". It was at this meeting the acronym EAMA was adopted.

    We were asked to sponsor the fourth meeting, but we declined in
view of the potential problems with receiving a large delegation from
China. Now the fourth meeting of EAMA, thanks to Yunnan Observatory,
will be held in Kun-ming in early February 1999. As you may know,
Kunming is a city famous for its all Spring weather and natural
beauty. Li-jiang (Beautiful River) and Dali which is included in the 
agenda for a visit, are even better known scenic places in China. 
Winter is right in their dry season. As a member of the SOC, I strongly 
encourage you to go to the meeting.

    If you have questions, please direct them to me or Dr. Tsay
(tsay@phyast.phy.ncu.edu.tw), who is also on the SOC.

    With best wishes,                   Chi Yuan

                              SECOND ANNOUNCEMENT


                     The 4th East Asia Meeting on Astronomy

                Observational Astrophysics in Asia and its Future

                       in Kunming, China, Feb 6-14, 1999


OBJECTIVE AND SCIENTIFIC TOPICS

As described in the First Announcement (March 1998), the objective of the 4th EAMA meeting
are to highlight the following topics and to illustrate the aspects of tne Observational
Astrophysics in Asia and its Future. 

1. Scientific results from ground-besed and space telescopes mainly in Asia

   Recent results of astronomical studies from ground-based and space telescope observation
   will be reported. Many applications for this session have been already received. More
   applications in various fields of astrophysics are welcome. Besides some invited talks,
   contributed talks and posters will be shown in this session.

2. Development, construction and plans for telescope and related instruments 

   Many plans of telescope and instrumentation developments are under way in Asian countries.
   Details of such projects and plans will be reported and various possibilities of coopera-
   tion will be discussed. Besides some invited talks, contributed talks and poster papers
   are also available.

3. Surveys, experiments and developments of astronomical sites in Asia

   The importance of the survey for good astronomical sites is increasing, as the observing
   wavelength and methods extend rapidly. Efforts and plans of such site surveys, technical
   improvements and developments will be reported. Discussions on the possible collaboration
   in this field will be made in this session. Besides some invited talks, contributed talks
   and posters are also available.

4. Proposal and discussions on collaboration in Asia

   The collaboration in Asian astrophysics has been improved recently, however it should be
   made more efficiently in the future. The productive samples of active collaboration will 
   be reported, and possible collaboration in the future will be proposed and discussed.
