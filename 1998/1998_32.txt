			An International Conference

    	     Rutgers University, New Brunswick, New Jersey, USA

			      8-12  August 1998 


	
SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE:
--------------------

The meeting will focus on insights into the structure and evolution of
galaxies that have been gleaned from observational and theoretical
studies of galactic dynamics. In recent years, great strides have been
made in both the theoretical modeling and observational understanding
of galaxies. We believe that the time has come to confront models of
galaxy formation and evolution with constraints from detailed studies
of nearby galaxies and galaxies at large redshifts.

DURATION OF CONFERENCE:
----------------------

The meeting will begin on the morning of Saturday, August 8, 1998 and
end at noon on Wednesday, August 12, 1998.


REGISTRATION :
-------------

We will be able to accommodate approximately 150 participants.  The
registration fee of $175 includes a copy of the conference proceedings
(to be published by the Astronomical Society of the Pacific). The
deadline for early registration is June 15, 1998.  Participants
registering after June 15 will be charged a late fee of $15. You are
strongly encouraged to register via the web registration form which is
available at the conference website
(http://www.physics.rutgers.edu/~dynamics)

If you do not have access to the web or would like to alter some
information that was submitted, you may use instead the e-mail
registration form available at the end of this announcement. This form
should be e-mailed to dynamics@physics.rutgers.edu.

CONTRIBUTED PAPERS:
------------------

Participants are invited to present poster papers. The SOC will select
some of these for contributed oral presentations (15 minutes duration)
following the invited reviews in each session. Ample space will be
available for poster presentations. THE DEADLINE FOR RECEIVING
ABSTRACTS TO BE CONSIDERED FOR ORAL PRESENTATION IS May 1, 1998.  You
may submit the abstract: (a) via our web page (preferred):
http://www.physics.rutgers.edu/~dynamics, or (b) by e-mailing the
attached registration form to: dynamics@physics.rutgers.edu


ACCOMMODATION AND BOARD:
-----------------------

On-Campus Accommodation:

The most convenient accommodation for participants is at Rutgers
University's Morrow-Thomas Suites on the Busch Campus. Each Suite
consists of 3 rooms and a bathroom.  The accommodation is modest but
comfortable and conveniently located with respect to the meeting
location. The room charge per participant INCLUDES 3 cafeteria-style
meals a day which will be served at the Davidson Dining Hall.

Room and Board Charge for on-campus Residents:
Single Occupancy: $70.00 per day x 5 days = $350.00
Double Occupancy: $63.00 per day x 5 days = $315.00
[The University Conference Service requires us to
charge each participant for 5 whole days.]

If you are going to be accompanied by any non-registered persons you
must pay an additional $315.00 for that person. Single rooms are
likely to be limited in number but we will try to accomodate your
first preference.

Off-Campus Accomodation:

None of the area hotels are accessible by foot or bus from the meeting
location. Participants wishing to stay at area hotels will therefore
need to bring their own cars to drive to the meeting location. These
participants (commuters) can sign up for lunch coupons. Lunch coupons
and a daily parking permit will be available for $10.00 per day x 5
days = $50.00. A list of area hotels at which special Rutgers
University discount rates are offered may be found at:
http://www.physics.rutgers.edu/~dynamics/hotellist.html


SPECIAL EVENTS:
-----------------

Welcome Reception: 

A welcome reception will be held on Friday, August 7 from 7pm-9pm at
the Davidson Faculty Dining Hall.

Barbecue Picnic: 

On the evening of Saturday, August 8, from 5pm - 9pm there will be a
Barbecue Dinner at the Log Cabin on the Douglass-Cook Campus of
Rutgers University.  The Log Cabin is located in a very scenic part of
the campus.  Residents of the Morrow-Thomas Suites will be charged
$9.00 per head (since cost of the standard dinner is credited to them)
and commuters will be charged $17.00 per head. Residents of the Suites
who do not wish to attend the barbecue can have dinner at the Davidson
Dining Hall.

Panel-Discussion:

On the evening of Monday, August 10 we will have an informal
post-dinner panel discussion. The details are still to be 
determined. 
 

Conference Banquet:

The Conference Banquet will be held on the evening of Tuesday, 11
August. Transportation to the Banquet will be available.  The cost of
the Banquet is $20.00 for residents (since cost of the standard dinner
is credited to them) and $28.00 for commuters. Residents of the Suites
who do not wish to attend the banquet can have dinner at the Davidson
Dining Hall. At a later date we will provide more information on the
Banquet but we would appreciate knowing if you plan to attend.
