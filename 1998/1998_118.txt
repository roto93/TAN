          International Square Kilometre Array Science Meeting
                          2nd Announcement
                          July 19 - 22, 1998

Please register for the meeting at http://www.ras.ucalgary.ca/SKA/meeting.html

Over the past several years, discussions have been occurring in several
countries about the next logical step in new radio astronomy instrumentation
following the up-coming construction of large millimetre arrays. An initiative
has emerged to develop a telescope to provide two orders of magnitude increase
in sensitivity over existing facilities at metre to centimetre wavelengths. To
achieve this goal will require a telescope with one square kilometre of
collecting area - one hundred times more collecting area than the Very Large
Array. The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) would probe the gaseous component of
the early Universe, thereby addressing fundamental questions about the origin
and evolution of the Universe. The SKA would complement planned facilities at
other wavelengths, such as the Next Generation Space Telescope (NGST). HI, CO
and continuum radiation would be observed from the interstellar media of most
of the galaxies that NGST will discover in the infrared at large redshifts.

The aim of the Square Kilometre Array Science Meeting in Calgary on July 20-22
is to explore and document the scientific impact of the Square Kilometre Array
on astronomy, from cosmology to galaxies, the interstellar medium, stars and
the solar system.  The location of the workshop, in the foothills of the Rocky
Mountains, is conducive to visionary thinking about radio astronomy for the
next generation.

instrument specifications can be found at

The Meeting

The meeting sessions will be held on July 20, 21 and 22.  There will be a
reception on the evening of the 19th.  The draft of the meeting program can be
viewed at http://www.ras.ucalgary.ca/SKA/meeting.html.

There will be no registration fee for the meeting.

The meeting will take place at the Nakoda Lodge, a guest lodge and conference
centre about 45 minutes drive west of the city of Calgary. The lodge is
operated by the Stoney Indians and is located in a secluded wooded area by
Chief Hector Lake on the Stoney Reserve in the Rocky Mountains. It is about
40 minutes from the well-known resort town of Banff in Banff national Park.
The Nakoda Lodge is self-contained, with accommodation and dining for
participants and their families. During July the weather is generally warm
and sunny, eminently suitable for outdoor recreations. Possibilities include
fishing, canoeing, day hikes and cultural tours of the Stoney tradition and
culture.

Accommodation at the lodge costs $132 CDN per person per day for single
occupancy. Double occupancy is $108 per person per day. These costs include
room plus three meals - breakfast, lunch and dinner. Rooms have been booked
for the 19th to 22nd of July inclusive. Accommodation at the lodge will be
limited, so please register early to guarantee a room. In any case
registration should be submitted by June 26.


Logistics

Please fill out the meeting registration form at

http://www.ras.ucalgary.ca/SKA/meeting.html before June 26.

Blocks of rooms have been reserved at two hotels near the University of Calgary
for the night of July 18th. If you will be arriving on Saturday please make a
booking directly with either

The Highlander Hotel         ($100 + 12% tax)
1818 - 16th Avenue N.W.
Fax:   1-403-289-3901
Phone: 1-403-289-1961 or within North America 1-800-661-9564.

or

The Quality Inn       ($99 + 12% tax)
2359 Banff Trail N.W.
Fax:   1-403-282-1241
Phone: 1-403-289-1973 or within North America 1-800-661-4667.

Mention that you are reserving with the "Square Kilometre Array".
(Reservations at the Quality Inn should be made with/addressed to "Brenda")

To ensure accommodation please book as soon as possible and no later than 18
June, when the block booking expires.

A bus will leave from the hotels around 1:00 p.m. on Sunday the 19th of July.
A second bus will depart at 5:00 p.m., and, if necessary a third at 8:00 p.m.
Bus transportation from Nakoda lodge to the Calgary International Airport will
be provided on the morning of July 23rd.

No public transportation is available in or out of the Nakoda lodge.  The lodge
is fully self contained and a personal vehicle will not be necessary unless
you wish explore the surround area, in which case a car is essential. Within
about 30 minutes drive of the lodge are the communities of Kananaskis Village
(the downhill ski venue for the 1988 winter Olympics), Canmore (at the gates
to Banff National Park) and Cochrane (site of the Western Heritage Centre).
Maps showing the location of the Nakoda Lodge and directions from Calgary will
be sent to all registered participants.
