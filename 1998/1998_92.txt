The day will include demonstrations of applications developed for the 3D
immersive environments of the CAVE=99, the PowerWall=99 and the ImmersaDesk=

Participants will see demonstrations of a variety of new technologies and
software tools, including a tool called Virtual Director, which allows the
user to manipulate and navigate in the 3D environment, collaborative 3D
visualization tools for astronomy ,and an example of remote design of earth
