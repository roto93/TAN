The NRAO has the following job vacancy:

Assistant Scientist
NATIONAL RADIO ASTRONOMY OBSERVATORY
P.O. Box 0
Socorro,  NM  87801-0387
Attn:  Personnel Department

The NRAO is seeking an Assistant Scientist to develop radio-astronomical
imaging software adapted to run on parallel computers.  Participates in
the design and coding of parallelized data reduction software, and
advises astronomers on the use of this software.  Pursuit of
astronomical research is expected (25% research time).  Initial
appointment will be for a period of two years;  continuation for up to
four years may be considered.

The AIPS++ Project is an international collaboration by a consortium of
radio observatories, managed by the National Radio Astronomy Observatory
(NRAO) with the goal of developing a software package for the processing
of radio astronomical data.  Investigation and development of algorithms
to run on parallel computers is being pursued within the AIPS++ Project
by the NRAO and the National Center for Supercomputing Applications
(NCSA), with funding from the NCSA. 

Applicants must have a Ph.D. in Astronomy, Physics or related fields,
with an interest and experience in software development.  Experience in
the use of radio interferometers is required.  Some familiarity with
object-oriented methods and C++ is desirable.  Experience in a large
software project would be advantageous.

Information about the NRAO is available at http://www.nrao.edu.

Applicants should send a cirreculum vitae, a letter with a description
of research interests, and arrange for three letters of reference to be
sent to the above address.  Applications received before 1 November 1998
will receive full consideration.

The National Radio Astronomy Observatory is operated by Associated
Universities, Inc., under cooperative agreement with the National
Science Foundation.  EOE/M/F/D/V
