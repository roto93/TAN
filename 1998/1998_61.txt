There is another ammendment, or rather an addition, to the lecture series.  Dr 
Erick Young has agreed to give an extra talk on "Development of far-IR arrays 
for SIRTF."  He gave this talk at the recent SPIE meeting in Hawaii, and it was 
so well received that it was felt he should give this talk at this lecture 
series as well.  Thus, the final schedule is:
