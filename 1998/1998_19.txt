1.  ELECTRONIC ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL DEBUTS

The Astronomical Journal is now online beginning with 
Volume 115, number 1 (January 1998):

http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/AJ/

Like the ApJ, AJ articles are available in HTML, PDF and PS 
formats and feature a full set of internal and external links. 
The AJ includes video- and machine-readable versions of the data 
tables.

Free access will be permitted during the next few months. 
In mid-1998 a subscription will be required to access the 
electronic version.

AAS Members may subscribe to an Electronic Package (AJ/ApJ/ApJS) 
for $80.  Members with current electronic subscriptions will 
have the AJ included automatically. Member subscriptions allow 
access from any computer on the Internet through a personal,
password-controlled subscription.  See:  
http://www.aas.org/membership/dues.html for additional
subscription options. Member inquiries and subscription orders 
should be directed to Sharon Savoy at ssavoy@aas.org.

Institutional licenses allow anyone at the institution to read 
the journal.  If your library already subscribes to the paper AJ, 
there is no additional cost for them to add the electronic access.  
Further information on how to register an institutions's IP address 
will be posted soon.

2.  MEMORIAL SERVICE FOR DAVID SCHRAMM  
    SATURDAY, 31 JAN 98, 2 PM

Contact:  Diana Steele, (773) 702-8366, d-steele@uchicago.edu

A memorial service for world-renowned University of Chicago
astrophysicist David Schramm will be held on Saturday, 31 January 
1998, at 2 pm in Rockefeller Chapel, 5850 S. Woodlawn Ave., Chicago,
IL.  Schramm, Vice President for Research and Louis Block Distinguished 
Service Professor in the Physical Sciences, was widely known for 
his leadership in the field of cosmology and particularly for 
uniting the study of the early universe with the study of 
elementary particles.  He was killed 19 December 1997 when the 
twin-engine plane he was piloting crashed outside Denver.

A reception following the service will be held in the Quadrangle 
Club, 1155 E. 57th St., Chicago.

A memorial fund in Schramm's name is being established at the
University.  Contributions may be sent to the Department of 
Astronomy & Astrophysics, 5640 S. Ellis Ave., Chicago, IL, 60637.
For more information, call the Department of Astronomy &
Astrophysics at (773) 702-8203.

4.  COLLABORATIVES TO INTEGRATE RESEARCH AND EDUCATION
    Nathaniel G. Pitts, Director, NSF Office of Science and
    Technology Infrastructure (OSTI)

The Senior Management Integration Group has initiated an activity
which seeks to establish long-term research and education
relationships between minority-serving institutions and NSF-supported
centers or facilities.  This activity is a cross-organizational
activity named Collaboratives to Integrate Research and Education
or CIRE.  Since the solicitation for proposals for CIRE will not be
printed by NSF, you should inform your respective communities, centers
and/or facilities that information regarding this competition can be
found on the WEB at:
