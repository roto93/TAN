CONFERENCE THEME:



This century has truly brought about an explosive period of growth and
discovery
for the physical sciences as a whole, and for astronomy in particular.
It is in this century that we have discovered how stars are born, live
and die; that our galaxy is not alone; that we live in an
expanding big-bang universe
which is filled with billions of galaxies.

We have now reached an epoch
in our
history when tiny dust grains and macromolecules may actually be seen in
emission. That magic moment when cold dust grains
may be studied in emission is fast approaching.
The presence of cosmic dust and its influence on the morphology of
galaxies is inextricably intertwined.

As the final decade of the 20th century comes to a close, we are
entering
into  the holy grail of astronomy ... the question of
ORIGINS.
How did galaxies -- with their magnificent spiral and elliptical
shapes -- actually come into existence from a universe
initially
flooded with electromagnetic energy and light? A crucial chapter is
missing from our story. The actual birth of galaxies such as our
Milky Way still remains a mystery. At much greater look-back times, what
are
the morphologies of Lyman break galaxies? What are the dynamics
and morphologies of damped Lyman alpha systems? For our closer
neighbours,
can we develop a morphological classification scheme for those stellar
Population II disks revealed in dust-penetrated imaging?



Furthermore, on the minds of multitudes as we enter the new
Millennium is the question of possible aloneness in a vast cosmos --
a cosmos spanning billions of light years. Are there any cosmic
blueprints for design in our universe? Foremost cosmologists of
our age continue to write books on this subject for the public
arena... cosmologists such as Sir M. Rees (Astronomer Royal/
England) and Prof. GFR Ellis (author of `Before the Beginning' and co-author
of another treatise with Prof S. Hawking at Cambridge).
Both Rees and Ellis are on board our SOC. It is because the very issues of
origins of the observer remain at the forefront of scientific
enterprise and endeavour that a short two or three hour mini-session will
form an appropriate ORIGINS Conference Finale.




As we approach the New Millenium, we are encouraged to believe that
someday we will be in a
position to delineate, in detail, the actual cosmic events which led to
conditions suitable for our own existence. The missing chapters need
to be written. As someone appropriately
remarked:

``The early universe is our scientific dark age.''

Holding such a Conference in 1999 will be very timely prior
the launch of the Next Generation Space
Telescope - and other space telescopes - in the New Millennium. The
Conference
will focus on those scientific questions which must be answered before
these challenging space projects see first light.


-----------------------------------------------------------

Scientific Rationale:

TITLE: A NEW MILLENNIUM FOR GALAXY MORPHOLOGY

SUBTITLE: ORIGINS -- Can we leave the Dark Ages?

The complete rationale also appears on our Website:

http://www.cam.wits.ac.za/origins99/

1. Morphological differences between galaxies in the
early universe and
today, based on Hubble Space telescope observations of distant
galaxies:

(*) Bar fraction as a function of time: do bars form today?
(*) Interacting galaxy morphology, then and now
(*) Galaxy luminosity functions, then and now.


2. ISO Infrared, optical, and uv morphologies compared:

(*) ISO images of galaxies for the infra-red picture
(*) Hubble deep field morphology compared to today's UV
morphology of galaxies
(*) Results from the ISO deep surveys
(*) Morphology of Lyman break galaxies in the Hubble Deep Field.
(*) Spiral arms, bulges, nuclei, outer disks, dwarfs ...., at
different
wavelengths: tracers of mass, star formation, and dust.

3. X-ray morphology of galaxies:  New results from AXAF;
diffuse x-rays
from the interstellar
medium, compact x-ray sources and supernova remnants in spiral arms
and the general disk

4. The morphology of HI and molecular gas distributions:

(*) relative to spiral arms, bulge/disk distributions, general
disk gradients
(*) photodissociation fronts in spiral arms, arm/interarm
contrasts in
gas, density wave triggered star formation: evidence
(*) phases of the ISM; variations with position.
(*) molecular gas and dust at high redshifts



5. Outer disk morphology:

(*) Star formation, spiral arms beyond the outer Lindblad
resonance
(*) Dwarf companions
(*) Tidal tails and bridges in interacting galaxies.

6. Dust morphology:

(*) Toward a new dust-penetrated classification scheme for
stellar disks
(*) Dark near-infrared spiral arms of dust
(*) Unified images of dust: macromolecules and dust grains
spanning the entire population range in size
(*) Insights from near- and mid-infrared minus optical images
(*) Central disk-like dust structures in ellipticals
(*) Extended dust lanes and patches in early-type galaxies

7. On the origin of the Hubble sequence:

(*) Hubble type evolution by internal processes (bar formation,
viscous
     evolution, etc.)
(*) Supermassive black holes and galaxy morphology
(*) Hubble type evolution by external processes (galaxy
interactions,
     coalescence, etc.)
(*) Evidence for evolution from high redshift observations.

8. The origin of
the observer:

(*) Fine-tuning
of the fundamental constants
(*)  The Anthropic Cosmological Principle

-------------------------------------------------------

PRE-REGISTRATION OF INTENT TO PARTICIPATE:


The Pre-registration Form, contained on our Webpage

http://www.cam.wits.ac.za/origins99/

must please be completed and
submitted before
March 31 of this year, indicating intent/possible intent to participate.

Even though
the New Millenium actually begins on 1 January 2001, the public en-masse
will celebrate the 1999/2000 event and there is the
most intense pressure for hotel bookings from September 1999 (the month of
our Conference) until the beginning of 2000.  (Many game lodges here are
also experiencing unprecedented public bookings from September 1999
onwards).

We have provisionally made a block-booking for our Conference on a 432
hectare farm near Johannesburg,  where some of the most sophisticated
recording/taping sessions are possible,  for inclusion in our Conference
proceedings.

The 432 hectare farm is rich in bird life and blesbuck and contains 600
bedrooms. A traditional African thatched `lapa' forms an integral part of
the
setting.

Conference attendance will be limited to 200.

The Conference "Toward a New Millennnium in Galaxy Morphology" is being held
as a sequel to our 1996 International Conference in
Johannesburg. (For participants interested in perusing the work of those
astronomers who participated in 1996, please see the proceedings contained
in the KLUWER Astrophysics and Space Library -- volume 209 -- edited
by Block and Greenberg).


The registration fee for the 1999 New Millennium Conference will be set (in
US dollars) at 400 USD, which will include a 700 page (approx) volume,
on gloss paper.
The volume will contain full length [20-25 printed pages each] review
articles by some 15 keynote speakers elected by the SOC, and
between 16 and 24 full colour plates. Also included will be a
reflection of
the discussions following the actual lectures, and a special `Eyes to
the
Millennium' interactive panel-audience  discussion -- all of which will be
transcribed into LATEX format from the video/audio tapes. The front and
back covers of the volume will be in colour.


A special 'New Millenium' Program will also be printed with the
names of speakers and of the titles of their talks.
As in 1996, it will be a requirement of every SOC-elected speaker to
hand in a camera-ready copy of their talk at registration. The program
cover will be UV-glazed and handed to each registered participant.


South African astronomers wishing to attend the Conference are greatly
encouraged to do so; assistance with the registration fee for South African
nationals can either be applied for through traditional South African
government
sources (eg. the FRD) or through a fund established by a South African
sponsor
specifically earmarked to help with South African delegates, especially
those with disadvantaged backgrounds.


The registration fee is only payable 12 months from now, on March 1, 1999
(six months before the Conference),
but your preregistration form must be received by the end of next month
(March 31 1998).



Fees for  accomodation/meals are NOT included in the registration fee, and
will be announced in due course, in the NEWS link of our WWW site.
Provisional attendance numbers (based on your preregistration responses by
the end of next month, March 31 ) will be conveyed to the Conference centre
on
April 1, 1998. We stress once again that
millennium fever has reached South Africa well in advance, as far as
the bookings of large Auditoria and hotels are concerned.

A special response email account for our Conference has been established in
honour of the late Dr Fritz Zwicky, whose pioneering insights into the
morphology of the stellar component of galactic disks of  M51, for example,
are now being borne out by modern, dust-penetrated, near-infrared array
imaging.

You may either submit your provisional preregistration form on the
WWW link

http://www.cam.wits.ac.za/origins99/

by clicking on the SUBMIT button in the form provided there,  or via
regular email to:

zwicky@gauss.cam.wits.ac.za




The original CGI script for the HTML preregistration form was very
kindly provided to us by Dr V. Ossenkopf and should greatly expedite
ease of your registration.




---------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: Our WWW site will be regularly updated to reflect
new developments regarding the Conference. Always
download the NEWS link there, for most recent announcements.

Apologies to those who may receive more than one of these first
announcements
by email, but our distribution lists are drawn from different sources.

----------------------------------------------------------


On behalf of the SOC,
we greatly
look forward to having you with us in 1999.

May it truly  be an ELECTRIFYING Conference in many  ways.
