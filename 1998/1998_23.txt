 First Announcement

 THE UNIVERSE AS SEEN BY ISO
 20-23 October 1998
 UNESCO Buildings
 Paris, France
 
 
 A conference to highlight the findings obtained with the ESA's Infrared
 Space Observatory (ISO) from comets to cosmology.
 
 
 Goal of the conference
 -----------------------
 
 The Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) was launched on 17 November 1995 and
 has been operated successfully since then.  As the first results have
 already shown, ISO has provided a breakthrough in our understanding of
 the composition of cosmic gas and dust, the physical processes related to
 star formation, the evolution of stars in both our and external galaxies,
 the mechanisms at play in the infrared galaxies and the nature of their
 powering sources up to cosmological distances. The infrared observations
 provided by ISO connect many fields of astronomy through the diagnostics
 of the major atomic and molecular cooling lines or important physical
 processes like the dust/gas exchange and the chemistry.
 
 By the autumn of 1998, half a year after the end of the mission, many
 results will be available and ready for presentation. Thus, it appears
 appropriate at that time to hold a major scientific meeting to summarise
 and discuss the results obtained during the ISO mission in all fields of
 astrophysics.

 Call for Contributed Papers
 ---------------------------
 
 Papers for presentation will be selected on the basis of abstracts
 of approximately 300-500 words.  The abstract should clearly outline 
 the paper's major elements of interest and its originality.  Papers
 will be selected on the basis of:
 	- general interest,
 	- quality of the content,
 	- originality of the ideas presented.
 
 Abstracts should contain the following information:
  - Title of paper (in capital letters, centred)
  - Author(s) name(s)
  - Affiliation(s) of the author(s)
  - Body of text
 with full mail address, phone/fax numbers and e-mail address of the
 contact person.  Accepted abstracts will be included in an Abstracts
 book, to be circulated at the conference.
 
 Abstracts should be sent by e-mail before 15 May 1998 to
 'isoconf@ias.fr'.
 
 Authors will be notified of the decision of the Programme Committee by 
 1 July 1998.  Authors whose paper has been accepted will then receive the
 necessary instructions for the preparation of their manuscript.
 
 
 Proceedings
 -----------
 
 The Proceedings will be published in the ESA Special Publications series
 (SP-427) within three months after the meeting.  The original papers
 must be handed over in camera-ready form to the Editor during the
 workshop.
