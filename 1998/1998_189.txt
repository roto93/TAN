>Greetings Potential XMM User,
>    The X-ray Multi-Mirror (XMM) Observatory is the second cornerstone 
>mission in the European Space Agency's Horizon 2000 program, and is 
>scheduled for launch 21 January 2000.  XMM will be an observatory-class 
>X-ray facility for the first decade of the next century.
>    The XMM payload consists of three large-area 7.5m focal length X-ray 
>telescopes and a 30cm diameter optical/UV telescope (Optical/UV Monitor, 
>OM), all of which will be in simultaneous operation.  The X-ray telescopes 
>have CCD focal-plane detectors (European Photon Imaging Cameras, EPIC), 
>which provide ~6" (FWHM) imaging and moderate spectral resolution over 
>the 0.1-15 keV energy range.  Two of the telescopes are also equipped 
>with reflection grating assemblies, which will provide high-resolution 
>spectra through the Reflection Grating Spectrometer (RGS).  The OM has 
>both broad-band imaging and grism spectroscopy capabilities.
>    Together the effective area, energy resolution, and angular 
>resolution of the X-ray telescopes far exceeds previous observatories, 
>and will compliment the capabilities of AXAF.  When combined with the 
>simultaneous optical/UV observations of the OM, XMM will prove to be 
>an exceptionally powerful instrument for investigating the universe.
>    XMM will have a Guest Observer (GO) program which will be open to  
>participation by US astronomers.  In addition, funding for successful 
>US GOs will be available through NASA.  To support US participation in 
>the XMM GO program, NASA has organized an XMM Guest Observer Facility 
>at the Goddard Space Flight Center.  AO-1 will be released 16 November
>1998 with a due date of 31 March 1999.
>
>With this e-mail status report, the NASA/GSFC XMM GOF is open for business.
>Informational WWW pages with links to ESA program pages can be found at:
>    http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/xmm/xmmgof.html
>The GOF can be reached by e-mail at: 
>    xmmgof@athena.gsfc.nasa.gov  
>For XMM questions there is an XMM help line at:
>    xmmhelp@athena.gsfc.nasa.gov
>
>A note on the e-mail distribution list used for this status report.  The
>list is a combination of the lists of several GOFs (e.g., ROSAT, ASCA, 
>and XTE).  An effort was made to remove duplications but with over 1500 
>entries, a complete success is unlikely.  So, if you received duplicate 
>copies of this distribution, or if you want to be deleted (or added for
>that matter) please e-mail xmmgof@athena.gsfc.nasa.gov with the subject
>"mailing list".
>
>Finally, the XMM SOC e-mail of 24 September 1998 announcing the release 
>of the XMM Users' Handbook has been included below.

>> Dear colleague,
>>
>> it is my pleasure to announce the release of the XMM Users' Handbook (UHB).
>> This document is the primary source of information for astronomers planning
>> to propose for XMM observations. The current version is issue 1.0, which is
>> the release to support astronomers in responding to the first call for XMM
>> proposals (AO-1), which will be issued on 1998 November 16.
>>
>> The XMM UHB can be accessed via our web site (or, alternatively, for ftp
>> transfer, from our ftp site).
