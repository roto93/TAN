15 May 1998

Dear Colleague,

The VLBA Observational Status Summary (OSS) has recently been updated.
This document provides, in concise form, the minimal information
needed to formulate technically sound proposals requesting VLBA
resources.  It also provides lists of relevant software and
documentation, plus a list of key NRAO personnel who can be consulted
for further, more detailed information.

The VLBA OSS is available via either

(a) anonymous FTP as a PostScript file with name "obssum.vlba.ps" 
    in directory "pub" on host "ftp.aoc.nrao.edu", or

(b) WWW browsers.  Use the URL "http://www.nrao.edu/" to point 
    toward the NRAO home page, which offers easy selection of the 
    VLBA home page.  Both HTML and PostScript versions of the 
    VLBA OSS can be accessed from the VLBA home page.  There are
    a few errant NRAO logos in some of the HTMLed tables; these
    logos should be gone Monday.

Let me take this opportunity to remind you that the next VLBA proposal
deadline is 1 June at 5pm EDT, for the proposal period 30 October 1998
to 1 February 1999.  Proposers asking for the phased VLA should be
aware that the VLA will be in its CnB and C configurations during the
proposal period.

Yours sincerely,
J.M. Wrobel
