>ONE-MILE-WIDE ASTEROID TO PASS CLOSER THAN THE MOON IN 2028
>
>     Recent orbit computations on an asteroid discovered last December
>indicate it is virtually certain that it will pass within the moon's distance
>of the earth a little more than 30 years from now.  The chance of an actual
>collision is small, but one is not entirely out of the question.
>
>     The asteroid, known as 1997 XF11, was discovered by Jim Scotti in
>the course of the Spacewatch program at the University of Arizona.  This
>program utilizes modern electronic technology on a 36-inch telescope at
>Kitt Peak that was built 77 years ago.
>
>     After the discovery observations on December 6, observations made by
>two Japanese amateur astronomers during the following two weeks showed that
>the minimum distance between the orbits of 1997 XF11 and the earth was
>very small.  Given also that the object was quite large as earth-approaching
>asteroids go, perhaps one mile across, it was added to the list of
>"potentially hazardous objects" (PHAs) that need to be monitored, lest they
>are destined to come dangerously close to the earth over the course of the
>next several centuries.  There are currently 108 PHAs.
>
>     As astronomers continued to gather data on 1997 XF11, it slowly
>began to become apparent that there would be a particularly close
>approach to the earth in October 2028.  A computation from observations
>spanning 60 days suggested that the miss distance would be 500 thousand
>miles.  This distance may seem large in human terms, but it was less than
>had previously been predicted in advance for any other known asteroid
>during the foreseeable future.
>
>     Observations made on March 3 and 4 by Peter Shelus with a 30-inch
>telescope at the McDonald Observatory in western Texas extended the
>observed arc of 1997 XF11 to 88 days.  This time, the orbit computation
>indicated a miss distance of only 30 thousand miles from the center
>of the earth; the earth's radius is about 4 thousand miles.  The time
>of encounter would be around 1:30 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time on Thursday,
>October 26, 2028.  That evening the object should be visible with the
>naked eye.  In Europe, where it would be dark by that time, the object
>should be a splendid sight as it moves from northwest to southeast
>across the sky over a couple of hours.
>
>     There is still some uncertainty to the computation.  On the one hand,
>it is possible that 1997 XF11 will come scarcely closer than the moon.
>On the other hand, the object could come significantly closer than
>30 thousand miles.  Further observations are necessary in order to refine
>the figures.  It is also possible that prediscovery observations of 1997 XF11
>can be located on archival photographs.  Particularly favorable opportunities
>for recording the object would have occurred in 1990, 1983, 1976, 1971 and
>1957.  Ephemerides for these times are available.
>
>     It is hoped that continuing observations will be made during the next
>few months.  The object is starting to move into the dusk and to fade
>week by week.  Nevertheless, it should be quite accessible for a while with
>large telescopes, which in addition to helping establish whether a
>collision in 2028 is possible, could usefully provide more definite
>information about the object's size.
>
>     Further observations of 1997 XF11 should be possible with moderate-sized
>telescopes equipped with electronic sensors early in the year 2000.  A
>better opportunity will occur in late 2002, when the object should be
>detectable with quite modest telescopes.  On that occasion the closest
>approach will be on Halloween, but the miss distance will be a safe
>6 million miles.
