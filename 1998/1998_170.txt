           EUROPEAN  VLBI  NETWORK   -   CALL  FOR  PROPOSALS

  *************************************************************************
  *        THE  EUROPEAN  VLBI  NETWORK  (EVN)  INVITES  OBSERVING        *
  *        PROPOSALS FOR  THE   OCTOBER  1ST,  1998      DEADLINE.        *
  *        RULES  FOR  SUBMITTING  APPLICATIONS  ARE  GIVEN  OVERLEAF.    *
  *************************************************************************

      The EVN consists of a VLBI network of radio telescopes in Europe and 
Asia operated by an international Consortium of institutes. For further
information, consult the EVN WWW Home page at:
               http://www.nfra.nl/jive/evn/evn.html
The "EVN User Guide" includes the "EVN Status Table" giving details of current
observing capabilities of all EVN antennas, and "How to apply for Observing
Time on the EVN", including a link to the "On-line VLBI Catalogue" of all 
past EVN observations. Current and recent EVN programs can be found under
"Scheduling EVN Observations". To subscribe to the international VLBI "e-mail 
exploder" (for topical information and news) send the message "subscribe vlbi"
in the body, not subject line, of an email to:   Majordomo@zia.aoc.nrao.edu

      The EVN encourages use of the Network by astronomers not specialised in
the VLBI technique. The Joint Institute for VLBI in Europe (JIVE) can provide
support for schedule making, correlation and data analysis of EVN projects, as
well as advice during proposal preparation. Please contact Michael Garrett
(mag@jive.nfra.nl) for the name of a support scientist. Proposers affiliated
to non-EVN institutes within the European Union may take advantage of the EC's
TMR programme "Access to Large-Scale Facilities". This provides travel and
other financial support for PIs (and their co-Is) to visit JIVE or the EVN 
observatories for correlation or data analysis. Contact M.Garrett for details.

                      OBSERVING SESSIONS IN 1999   (Draft plan)
                      --------------------------
   Session 1  Feb 11 - Mar 04     6 cm,  18 cm,    + ??    
   Session 2  May 27 - Jun 17     6 cm,  18 cm,    + ??    
   Session 3  Sep 09 - Sep 30     6 cm,  18 cm,    + ??
   Session 4  Nov 12 - Dec 03     6 cm,  18 cm,    + ??   

Proposals received by 1st October will be considered for scheduling in Session
1 or later. The planning of wavelengths for 1999 sessions is not fixed, but
most will include both 6 and 18 cm in order to support the EVN committment for
co-observing with the orbiting space-VLBI telescope HALCA. Other wavelengths
will be scheduled, depending on proposal pressure.  

              JOINT OBSERVATIONS with MERLIN, the DSN and the VLBA
              ----------------------------------------------------
Proposers may request EVN antennas together with other telescopes and arrays.
      Combined EVN+MERLIN observations add the short MERLIN array baselines 
to those of the EVN, as well as providing VLBI baselines to the CAMBRIDGE 
antenna. EVN+MERLIN observations at both 6 and 18 cm are planned for 1999.
      Antennas of the NASA DSN, in particular at Robledo (Madrid), will be
available for a few projects requiring very high sensitivity, in each EVN
observing session. A specific justification must be made in the proposal.
      "Global" proposals combine the EVN with the NRAO VLBA and/or other
US antennas, creating an array of up to 20 elements, ideal for very high
dynamic range imaging, and "snap-shot" observations of many sources. 

                   CORRELATION OF EVN OBSERVATIONS
                   -------------------------------
The MPIfR correlator in Bonn is available for EVN observations recorded in
MK3 modes. The VLBA correlator in Socorro is available for a limited number of
"EVN-only" experiments recorded in VLBA/MK4-compatible modes; priority for its
use will be decided by the EVN Program Committee and will be given to spectral
line proposals and those where the combination EVN + VLBA-correlator promises 
unique science. (A "List of validated VLBA or VLBA-compatible MKIV recording
modes" is available under "Scheduling EVN Observations" in the EVN User Guide)
Generally, "Global" proposals should also request use of the VLBA correlator
and use VLBA/MK4-compatible modes.
      It is also planned to correlate 1 or 2 "scientific pilot" projects on
the EVN correlator at JIVE. For the current correlator status, consult:
              http://www.nfra.nl/jive/correlator/status.html
Any proposer who is interested in exercising this possibility should first
contact Dr. Huib van Langevelde of the Correlator Operations before submitting
a proposal requesting use of this correlator (huib@jive.nfra.nl).

                    RULES FOR SUBMITTING PROPOSALS
                    ------------------------------
1) Any request requiring 2 or more EVN antennas constitutes an EVN proposal
   and must be sent to:         Dr. R. Schwartz, EVN Scheduler, MPIfR, 
                                Auf dem Huegel 69, D 53121, Bonn, GERMANY.
   Proposals must be received by 1 October 1998. A list of Project Codes and
   Principle Investigators for all proposals received will be posted on the
   EVN WWW Home Page under "EVN Program Committee".

   (This request is also sufficient for EVN+MERLIN and EVN+DSN proposals,
    and EVN-only proposals which require the VLBA correlator; see points
    5,6 and 7 for proposals also requesting the VLBA or other antennas)

2) The VLBI Proposal Coversheet should be used for all proposals. Copies can
   be obtained from:      http://www.nfra.nl/jive/evn/proposals/prop.html
   The desired observing wavelengths, antennas, sources and GST ranges,
   recording mode and correlator must be specified. If appropriate, specify 
   the GST range for Sh and Ur antennas separately.

  >>   FOR ALL SPECTRAL LINE PROPOSALS, THE NUMBER OF VIDEO (BASEBAND)
  >>   CHANNELS, CHANNEL BANDWIDTH AND BITS/SAMPLE MUST BE GIVEN

3) The text, which SHOULD NOT EXCEED 2 SIDES, should contain both a scientific
   and a technical justification for the resources requested, and should 
   include a brief summary of any related EVN proposals which have been
   observed or scheduled. Up to 2 additional sides with diagrams may be
   included; the total, including cover sheet, should not exceed 6 sides.
   Proposers should identify any individual EVN or non-EVN antenna(s)
   whose participation is considered essential for achieving their goals.
   Special justification is needed for DSN antennas and MERLIN.

  >>   PROPOSERS WHO REQUEST USE OF THE VLBA CORRELATOR FOR EVN EXPERIMENTS
  >>   MUST CLEARLY INDICATE WHETHER THE OBSERVATION IS ALSO FEASIBLE USING 
  >>   MK3 MODE RECORDING AND THE MPIfR-BONN CORRELATOR, SINCE VLBA 
  >>   CORRELATOR TIME CAN ONLY BE GRANTED IN A LIMITED NUMBER OF CASES.

4) Proposals submitted by FAX cannot be accepted. Proposers are encouraged to
   submit by e-mail (although NOT if this is at the expense of excluding help-
   ful diagrams). They must be in Adobe post-script format, concatenated 
   into a single file, and sent to :        proposevn@HP.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de
   An automatic machine reply will be returned if the email has arrived.

  >>   Send proposals A FEW DAYS BEFORE the deadline; only in this case
         can senders be notified if the file fails to print !!
  >>   Write a 3-4 word title as the subject line for proposal identification
  >>   Avoid grey-scale plots, which can create very lengthy files.
  >>   Avoid sending proposals in duplicate
  >>   DO NOT SEND THE FILE "UUENCODED" OR AS A "MIME" MAIL ATTACHMENT !
  >>   IF you specify paper size for printing, only specify size A4

5) EVN Global proposals which also request the VLBA or other US antennas (eg 
   GB or VLA) must ALSO be sent to:    The Director, NRAO, Edgemont Road,
                                       Charlottesville, VA 22903-2475, USA
   Requests for the EVN with a single VLBA antenna must also be sent to NRAO.
   E-mail submission (with same rules as in (4)) to:      propsoc@nrao.edu
   (but do NOT specify A4 size for printing)

6) Requests for THE VLBA + EFFELSBERG ALONE must be sent to both NRAO AND
   MPIfR  (c/o  Dr. R. Schwartz, Auf dem Huegel 69, D 53121 Bonn, GERMANY)

7) Requests for other antennas NOT affiliated with the EVN or NRAO should
   be indicated in the proposal, but the PROPOSER MUST SEND A COPY of the
   proposal to the Director/Scheduler of the observatory involved, and will
   be responsible for arranging all aspects of their participation, including
   scheduling, tape supply and observing support.

8) Proposals which request the Bonn correlator must be limited in size to 6
   correlator "passes". This translates to a telescope limit of 12 for MK3
   modes B,C and E, and 9 for mode A (no cross-polarisation); and 9 for mode C
   and 5 for mode A with full polarisation correlations. 

  >>   PROPOSERS OF EVN SPECTRAL LINE OBSERVATIONS ARE ENCOURAGED TO REQUEST
  >>   USE OF THE VLBA CORRELATOR AND VLBA/MK4 MODE RECORDING. SEE RULE (1).

9) Any proposals requesting use of the EVN correlator at JIVE as "scientific
   pilot" projects may be submitted only after the proposer has consulted
   Dr. Huib van Langevelde of the Correlator Operations (huib@jive.nfra.nl)

10) All communication between the Proposer(s), and the EVN Program Committee
   or Scheduler will be via the Contact Author designated in the proposal. The
   results from proposal review will be communicated after the next meeting of
   the EVN Program Committee, and will be SENT BY EMAIL unless otherwise 
   requested in the proposal Abstract.

11) "Short" observations (< 4 hours) may be proposed up to 6 weeks before an
   observing session begins, by means of a brief justification to the 
   Chairman of the EVN PC, who will, at his discretion, authorise scheduling
   in any gaps in the session plan. They are intended to allow the EVN to
   respond to urgent "targets of opportunity", or to facilitate short, pilot
   observations, if needed in preparation for a full proposal. They can only
   be granted limited resources (number of telescopes, tapes, correlator time)
   and must use MK3 recording modes. They should not involve any special
   observing set-ups.  The present EVNPC Chairman is:  Richard Porcas, MPIfR, 
   Auf dem Huegel 69, D 53121, Bonn, Germany.  FAX: +49 (0)228-525229 ;
   TELEPHONE: +49 (0)228-525288 ;       E-mail: porcas@mpifr-bonn.mpg.de

Note that the following data from the proposal will be stored in machine-
readable form:  PI name, wavelength, observing mode, title of program,
requested telescopes, EVNPC rating. The data will be distributed to the EVN
Scheduler, VLBA scheduler and to members of the EVNPC. For proposals supported
under the TMR program "Access to Large-Scale Facilities", the title, author
list, and amount of time granted (or a brief reason for rejection) will be
made available to the EU Commission in Brussels.  Copies of all EVN+MERLIN
proposals will be made available to the MERLIN TAC Chairman, together with
the EVNPC rating.
