ODIN Postdoctoral Fellowship
Department of Physics and Astronomy
McMaster University
Hamilton Ontario
Canada L8S 4M1

Attention: Dr. C. Wilson (wilson@physics.mcmaster.ca)

Applications are invited for a postdoctoral fellowship associated
with the ODIN space astronomy mission. The ODIN mission is
a collaboration among Sweden, Canada, France, and Finland to study
the submillimeter lines of water and oxygen in the interstellar
medium. The satellite launch is currently scheduled for late fall
1998. The successful applicant will be expected to participate
in one or more of the research programs of the mission. 
She or he may also wish to participate in
ground-based observations using the JCMT or other submillimeter
telescopes. The successful applicant will have
experience in the interstellar medium and/or millimeter/submillimeter
astronomy. C. Wilson
is currently Co-PI for both the extragalactic and molecular cloud
research teams, and is also a Co-I with the high latitude cloud, and 
Magellanic Cloud teams;  applicants with an interest in one of
these areas are especially encouraged to apply.

The appointment will be for one year, with renewal for up to
two subsequent years contingent upon availability of funds. The salary
will be $29,000 (Canadian dollars) plus an annual research budget
of $3000. The starting date is flexible, but should fall somewhere in
the period of April to November 1998. Information on the
astrophysics group at McMaster University
is available at http://www.physics.mcmaster.ca/ and on ODIN at
http://www.ssc.se/ssd/ssat/odin.html

Interested candidates should submit a curriculum vitae, bibliography, 
and statement of research interests to Dr. C. Wilson at the above address.
Applicants should also
request three letters of recommendation to be sent directly
to Dr. C. Wilson.
All application materials are due by January 31, 1998.
