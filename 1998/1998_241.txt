Subject: New SCHED release.

There is a new release of SCHED - dated 1 Dec. 98.

See the section in the manual on this release for details of changes.

Some of the more significant changes are:

The source and station catalogs have been updated.  The VLBA
correlator catalogs were updated recently based on a new solution from
the USNO.  It has been many years since the last update so some of the
station locations were getting out of date.  This did not matter for
scheduling, but could introduce phase errors in processing.  The new
catalog has the station velocities, so it should remain accurate
longer.  Related to this, the formats for source positions in the
telescope control files and in the summary file (including the coordinates
that can be passed to the correlator) have changed to add a digit.

The plot options now include the ability of plot the dirty beam for a
given source.  Thank you Franco.  There have been some other
improvements to the plotting, especially for when there are large
numbers of stations.  I encourage those who haven't tried the plotting
yet to do so. I think you'll like it.

The default observe date used in conversions between B1950 and J2000
positions has been changed to 1979.9, which is correct for 1950
positions from the VLA which are based on calibrator positions
determined at that time.  For some instruments, like MERLIN, the right
date is 1950.  The documentation of this issue has been extended.

Sched will now inforce the correct three numeral format for project
codes that start with A, B, E, or G.  You must have, for example, BA035
rather than BA35.  This might seem trivial, but when managing the
hundreds of schedule files, it can be a real pain if users are not
consistent.

For doppler calculations, SCHED now supports LSR, heliocentric, and
geocentric reference frames and radio and optical definitions of
velocity.  You can also give "z", but if you do, be sure you have
sufficient accuracy.  These capabilities have not been thoroughly
tested so early users should compare results with other sources.

Early, rudimentary, support for the VLA-Pie Town link is provided.

At the AOC, there will now be subdirectories under the
/home/arana/cwalker/sched/bin directory where the executables reside.
The subdirectories will include SUN, LINUX, and SGI.  Executables for
those architectures will be in the subdirectories.  There will be
links in the bin directory to the SUN versions, but users on other
architectures should go to the OS specific directory.  Other sites may
wish to do something similar.  Something like this is required now
that our new workstations are Linux PC's.

Some checks are now made for JIVE correlator constraints when that
correlator is specified.  Also enhancements have been made to 
the ability to write VEX for more complicated schedules.

There were a moderate number of bug fixes and improvements of defaulting
capabilities.

UPTIME: I intend for this to be the last release that includes the
separate program UPTIME.  This program's functions have been replaced
by the schedule planning and plotting capabilities of SCHED.  If there
is anyone who objects to this, speak now or forever hold your peace.
You are, of course, welcome to keep the current version.  It is not
being altered except when some compiler has problems with it - which
is happening often enough to make us want to stop supporting it.


As usual, the code, catalogs, examples, etc are in the compressed
tar files on the ftp.aoc.nrao.edu anonymous ftp site in the pub/sched
subdirectory.  Some binary execute modules are available in
subdirectories below that.  

Also, as usual, the web version of the manual is at 
http://www.aoc.nrao.edu/~cwalker/sched/sched/sched.html.  
I highly recommend using the web version of the manual rather than trying
to generate a printed copy (possible using latex and the sched.tex file
included with the distribution).  It is over 200 pages long and evolves
fairly fast.  I have not personally printed a copy in many years.  The
HTML version is included with the distribution so you can browse
through it locally and avoid the World Wide Wait.  To do that, point
your browser at file://$SCHED/doc/sched/sched.html (You might need
to define or expand out the environment variable $SCHED).

Happy scheduling!

Craig Walker  (cwalker@nrao.edu).
