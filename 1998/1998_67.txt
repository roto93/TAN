Yes, Indeed I find the "Young Research Award" section in the news article 
is typically "science community bashing" that the un-science people love 
to use to discredit the peer review system in science community.  
I have never been involved in the review of "Young Research Award" of AS.  
(I think the limitation of recipiants of "Young Research Award" of AS to AS 
personnel is a reflection of narrow mindedness of AS administration).  
But I have been involved in the peer review system in Taiwan for some 
time.  There are certainly many problems with it, but its problem and its 
difficulty is not what these newsmen (or paperrazzi rather) can 
understand.  I was thinking about writing a letter to the newspaper to 
counter such "science community bashing" as the ROC Physics Society 
President.  But if I have to write letter for everyone of such articles, 
I would have no time for my own research!  It is good that Jeremy wishes 
to stand out and clarify this himself.  There is no better person to make 
this clear to the public.
I definitely think Jeremy should make a strong statement to the newspaper 
editor.
