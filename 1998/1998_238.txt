	    TITLE:   "The Shapes of Cross-Correlation Interferometers"

            ABSTRACT:
Cross-correlation imaging interferometers designed in the shape of a curve of 
constant width offer better sensitivity and imaging characteristics than other 
designs because they sample the Fourier space of the image better than other 
shapes, for example, ``{T's}'' or ``{Y's}''.  In a cross-correlation 
interferometer each pair of antennas measures one Fourier component with a 
spatial wavenumber proportional to the separation of the pair.  Placing the 
individual antennas of the interferometer along a curve of constant width, a 
curve that has the same diameter in all directions, guarantees that the spatial 
resolution of the instrument will be independent of direction because the 
measured Fourier components will have the same maximum spatial wavenumber in all 
directions.  The most uniform sampling within this circular region in Fourier 
space will be created by the particular symmetric curve of constant width which 
has the lowest degree of rotational symmetry or fewest number of sides, which is 
the Reuleaux triangle.  The constant width curve with the highest symmetry, the 
circle is the least satisfactory although still better than T's or Y's.

In all cases, the sampling can be further improved by perturbing the antenna 
locations slightly off a perfect curve to break down symmetries in the antenna 
pattern which cause symmetries and hence non-uniformities in the sampling 
pattern in Fourier space.  Appropriate patterns of perturbations can be 
determined numerically.  As a numerical problem, optimizing the sampling in 
Fourier space can be thought of as a generalization of the traveling salesman 
problem to a continuous two-dimensional space.  Self-organizing neural networks 
which are effective in solving the traveling salesman problem are also effective 
in generating optimal inteferometer shapes. The Smithsonian Astrophysical 
Observatory's Submillimeter Array, a cross-correlation imaging interferometer 
for astronomy will be constructed with a design based on the Reuleaux triangle.
