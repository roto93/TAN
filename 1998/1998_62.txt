IERS VLBI Coordinating Center Newsletter #1

I. Introduction

This is the first in what is planned to be a continuing series of newsletters
designed to improve the flow of information about and among various
geodetic/astrometric VLBI activities around the world.  It is one part of new
activities of the IERS VLBI Coordinating Center.  Another major part is the
development of the VLBI Coordinating Center web site hosted by NEOS at USNO. 
The emphasis of the newsletter and web site will be on observing programs and
data analysis.  VLBI observation coordination will continue in the existing
channels.

The aim of the newsletter is to provide status reports and to describe
events/activities of interest, both in the immediate past and future.  The
information of this issue has been gathered informally by the VLBI
Coordinator, who is responsible for errors and omissions.  More complete or
comprehensive reports about VLBI activities are welcome and will be passed
along with minimal editing.  The newsletter will be distributed by Email and
via the web site.

II.  The Coordinating Center Web Site

The web site (http://maia.usno.navy.mil/VLBI) is divided into several topical
pages including: observing programs, newsletter, directory, meetings, papers,
FAQ, and the proposed new VLBI organization.  It is expected that the web site
will change with use and user input.

The observing program page will contain brief descriptions (and links if they
exist) of international and national geodetic/astrometric observing programs -
goals, participants, status, results, etc.

The newsletter page will have the current and past issues of the Coordinating
Center newsletter.

The directory will have names and email addresses (perhaps along with other
address information) of interested individuals.  It will be possible to Email
directly through this page.  The initial list was compiled by the VLBI
Coordinator of people involved in VLBI data analysis.  Interested parties who
were missed are encouraged to register, and anyone may withdraw at any time.

The meetings page will list meetings of specialized interest to VLBI
geodesy/astrometry along with links or points of contact.  The VLBI community
is encouraged to provide this information to the VLBI coordinator in a timely
fashion.

The papers page will list papers (and perhaps abstracts or links) relevant to
geodetic/astrometric VLBI.  The intention is to include recent papers and
reports, perhaps beginning with 1997, rather than a complete bibliography.

The contents of FAQ page will evolve with the use of the web site.  Initially
the plan is to give general background and history of geodetic/astrometric
VLBI - what is VLBI, what are its uses, what is the precision/accuracy, etc.

The page for the proposed new VLBI organization will follow the progress of
this effort.

III.  News Bits

1) Mark IV Correlator -- Due to technical and funding difficulties, the
completion of the Mark IV correlators is delayed.  Under the current plan,
assuming funding hopes materialize and parts availability continues, usable
but incomplete Mark IV correlators will be delivered in March 1999.

2) New VLBI Organization -- Terms of reference for a new international VLBI
organization concerned with geodetic and astrometric VLBI measurements and
analysis have been drafted.  These will be discussed in April at the CSTG
Executive Committee meeting, the IERS Directing Board meeting, and a splinter
session during the EGS meeting, all in Nice.

3) CORE -- There are now 38 CORE (Continuous Observations of the Rotation of
the Earth) sessions available, concurrent with or adjacent to NEOS sessions.
The wrms agreement between simultaneous sessions is about 200 mas for pole and
8 microsec for UT1, about 1.5 times the formal errors.  Biweekly CORE sessions
will continue in 1998.

4) New CALC -- The Goddard VLBI group is preparing a new version of CALC that
will, among other things, correct bugs in the equation of equinoxes and UT1S,
introduce an improved nutation model that agrees with the VLBI nutation offset
time series, and use the JPL DE403/LE403 ephemeris.  CALC 9.0 should be
available before this summer.

5) CGLBI -- The Canadian Geodetic Long Baseline Interferometry (CGLBI) program
has upgraded the Algonquin station, which now observes about once a week.  A
new 3.6 m transportable antenna has been tested, and a frequency-switching
system for wide bandwidth synthesis is being developed for the S2 data
acquisition system.

6) China News -- The NASA/EVN effort to assist in improving the Chinese VLBI
stations near Shanghai and Urumqi included a joint troubleshooting team last
summer and EVN-provided upgrades last fall.  The performance of the stations
during the two APSG (Asia-Pacific Space Geodynamics) sessions in October 1997
showed improvements but more work is needed.  An engineer from Urumqi will
assist in repackaging a NASA cryogenic S/X receiver for use at his station.

7) Tsukuba -- The new 32-m antenna of the Geographic Survey Institute in
Tsukuba, Japan will be dedicated in June 1998.  It will initially participate
in Japanese domestic VLBI with several 10-m antennas as well as international
astrometric sessions.  This antenna is unusually fast for its size, 3 deg/min.
Initial tests indicate that the sensitivity is good.

8) TIGO -- The German TIGO fundamental station, now located at Wettzell,
participated in its first VLBI session in December 1997.  Testing of the VLBI
component continues.

9) Web access to data -- The Goddard VLBI group has placed its X-band data
base files on CDDISA, where they can be retrieved via the VLBI group's web
site.  Compressed SINEX files and NGS card files will also be available on
CDDISA in the near future.
   
10) Svetloe -- The 32-m antenna at Svetloe, Russia made its first experimental
observations in November 1997. It will serve as part of the Quasar Network.
