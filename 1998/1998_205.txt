2.  STATUS OF HST SECOND DECADE STUDY 

The first-meeting proceedings of the HST Second Decade study, 
as well as all the study's working papers, are open and 
available now at 

http://sso.stsci.edu/second_decade/

The purpose of this study is to develop a strategic plan for 
the Hubble Space Telescope in its second ten years of operation. 
NASA has asked the Space Telescope Science Institute to lead 
and conduct the study on behalf of the scientific community. 
The first meeting was held in Baltimore on 7-8 July 1998. 
The second meeting will be in Garching, Germany, on 
17-18 November 1998.

Your interest and input in this study are valuable and welcome. 
There is alot of material at the WWW site, and we hope you will 
familiarize yourself with the range of complex issues before the 
committee, as well as the range of interesting opinions expressed. 
We hope to have your ideas and opinions too! The WWW site provides 
you an easy way to address email to any or all of the committee 
members. Input to the chair (rbrown@stsci.edu) will be posted
at the site. (Editorial and technical suggestions are also most 
welcome.)

Robert A. Brown, Chair, HST Second Decade study.

3.  OBSERVING OPPORTUNITY AT THE SOUTH POLE
    Proposals Due: 1 December 1998

The Center for Astrophysical Research in Antarctica (CARA) and
the National Optical Astronomy Observatories (NOAO) announce
the availability of telescope time on the SPIREX/Abu facility
at the South Pole.  SPIREX/Abu is a 60-cm telescope with a
1024 x 1024 InSb detector array.  Approximately 30% of the time
during the next austral winter (March through October 1999) will
be made available to the astronomical community through a
peer-review process.  All observations will be taken in queue mode.

Proposals are being accepted through the NOAO Web-based proposal
form - see the URL http://www.noao.edu/noaoprop/.  The deadline for
proposals for this observing opportunity is Tuesday evening at
midnight MST 1 December 1998.

The Abu IR instrument/detector combination provides a spectral range
of 2.4 - 4.8 microns, with a pixel scale of 0.6 arcsec per pixel
and a field-of-view of 10.2 arc minutes on a side.  See more about
this capability and sample data on the NOAO SPIREX/Abu Web page at
http://www.noao.edu/scope/south_pole/.

[Editor's Note: At the time we mailed this message, the NOAO 
Web-based proposal form was not available for browsing.  It
should be reposted momentarily.]
