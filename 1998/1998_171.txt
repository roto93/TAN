NOTICE OF A WORKSHOP ON THE SQUARE-KILOMETER ARRAY

Workshop dates:  9-10 October 1998

Place:  NRAO, Green Bank.

The proposed workshop will be an opportunity to address the desirability
of the participation by the US in the square-kilometer array project,
which at present is largely being investigated at Dwingeloo, Penticton,
and CSIRO/ATNF.  Several US centers have begun work as well, and the
workshop will be a good opportunity to compare notes and to seek-out
wider US interest.

Two recent international workshops have been held: At Sydney in Dec 1997
and at Calgary in July 1998 (earlier workshops were held in the
Netherlands at Leiden and Delft).  These will be summarized for
discussion.

There are six general topics on the agenda;

1.  Summary of SKA activities and rationale to date.

2.  Summary of Calgary and Sydney science workshops

3.  Current concepts

4.  Technical issues

5.  Strategic issues

6.  General discussion

Detailed arrangements for lodging etc. will be handled by the Green Bank
staff.  A registration form is attached or you can find one at

	http://www.gb.nrao.edu/~rfisher/SKAworkshop/skaworkshop.html

Note: This is prime tourist season for fall color; we have reserved a
block of rooms at local motels, but making your reservations early will
be very helpful.
