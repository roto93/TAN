Hi All,
  By now some of you may have seen the China Times newspaper article reporting 
my paper in Nature.  I'm saddened and dismayed by the whole process in trying to 
promote astronomy to the general public in one of the most effective mediums in 
Taiwan: the newspaper.
  The side article on "Young Research Award" comes as both a surprise and shock 
to me and everybody in the institute.  We have no complaints about the judgement 
process in deciding this award, nor did we raise this issue with the reporter.  
To set the record straight, I didn't even apply for this award last year.  Some 
reporters seem to see a need for running a controversial story at any cost.
  Suffice to say that I have no intention of dealing with this reporter in the 
future, although I will try to keep promoting astronomy in Taiwan as best as I 
can.  I deeply regret the harm this article has done to this Institute, the 
Academy, and most of all its superb President.
  
  
  sincerely,
  Jeremy Lim
