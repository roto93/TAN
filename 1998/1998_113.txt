 ----++++====   The JIVE Newsletter,  Year 1998, Number 1 ====++++----



Dear All,


This is the first issue of the JIVE newsletter. The JIVE newsletter is
intended for those interested in and working with VLBI and its
associated techniques. The newsletter will be prepared about six
times per year.

Its contents will mostly discuss the current situation, performance
and the capabilities of the EVN MkIV correlator at JIVE and progress
thereof as well as issues concerning the European VLBI Network
(EVN). Of course our attention will not be limited to only the
European community, input from other groups/institutes will be gladly
received and distributed as well. Our goal is to keep the
users/developers in contact with recent developments in the field of
VLBI.

Furthermore, the newsletter can be used to announce conferences,
meetings and symposia on the subject of VLBI.


NOTE: subscription to the JIVE newsletter does not happen
automatically, future versions will NOT be sent to existing mailing
lists. If you are interested in receiving the JIVE newsletter, please
mail to the following address, stating that you would like to receive
the newsletter.

1)  The Current situation of the JIVE MkIV Correlator 

After the successfull first fringes on July 21st 1997, the EVN MkIV
DataProcessor team reached a new milestone on February 17 1998, when
fringes were detected from 2 MarkIII tapes from Effelsberg and
Medicina. The correlation was controlled using a prototype CJD
(Correlation Job Descriptor) which controls the correlator hardware
settings. The correlator was set for dynamic phase/delay
correction. This test addressed two important issues: controlling the
correlator settings from a UNIX workstation and controlling multiple
Playback Units at the same time from the same high level control
software. Refer to http://www.nfra.nl/jive/correlator/first.html for
specific information about the experiments. At this moment,
experiments to get MkIV fringes are being carried out. 



2) The JIVE MkIV Data Processor hardware

At this time, 10 out of the total number of 16 Data Playback Units
(DPU's) have arrived at JIVE after passing their Factory Acceptance
Tests (FATs). The last four DPU's will be tested within two weeks and
are due to arrive shortly after that.

JIVE's technical manager, Steve Parsley, witnessed the FAT of the
reproduced Station Units at Allied Signal. The reports are
satisfactory. Two new station units are expected to arrive at JIVE
within two weeks from now.

Almost all of the correlator boards, needed to make up the whole of
the MkIV data processor, have arrived at JIVE and are being
tested. Currently, the tests are run on a test setup, having one-eighth
of the capacity of the full data processor.




3)  The upgrading of EVN recording terminals from MkIII to MkIV

The upgraded MKIII to MkIV equipment continues to be successfully used
for EVN observing sessions in both MkIII and VLBA modes. The problems
at low bandwidths when 500 kHz sample rates are used in the formatter
have been identified and solved. It should now be possible to run
narrow band line experiments.

Furthermore, the recorder at Shanghai was upgraded. It now is possible
to run thin tape at Shanghai. A number of other problems were also
fixed, which should result in improvements in recording quality.
