AUSLIG  POSITION  NUMBER 42,  REVISED ADVERTISMENT

AUSLIG is part of the Australian Government's Department of Industry,
Science and Resources and is the Commonwealth's primary source of advice on
land information matters. It manages the Commonwealth's mapping, geodesy,
remote sensing and maritime boundaries programs, and is responsible for
policy, standards and coordination associated with delivery of national and
international land information programs.

AUSLIG, in collaboration with The AUSTRALIA TELESCOPE NATIONAL FACILITY,
(ATNF), CSIRO and the RESEARCH SCHOOL OF EARTH SCIENCES, (RSES), AUSTRALIAN
NATIONAL UNIVERSITY, is seeking to set up a Geodetic VLBI program in
Australia. AUSLIG is offering an indefinite appointment to this program,
and is seeking a highly motivated person with a strong commitment to VLBI
geodesy to fill this position within AUSLIG's Space Geodesy Analysis
Centre. The position will initially be shared between AUSLIG, the ATNF and
the RSES, and the successful applicant may also be appointed as a Visiting
Fellow at the ATNF and/or RSES. A performance review will take place at the
end of the first year.

Applicants should hold a PhD or equivalent, or be within six months of the
degree being awarded, in geodetic VLBI, radio astronomy, satellite geodesy,
or a related field, with a sound background in geodesy, or have extensive
experience in one of these fields. The successful applicant will be
required to work and interact extensively with both radio astronomers and
geophysicists from the ATNF and RSES respectively. Reasonable relocation
expenses to Canberra will be provided. Periodic visits to collaborating
international organizations in Japan, the US and Europe will also be
required. The results of this program will be published in the scientific
literature.

The successful applicant will:

*   undertake VLBI observations, data processing and analysis in support of
geodetic science and geophysical applications,

*   deliver the appropriate geodetic products to customers, mainly for the
maintenance of the international terrestrial and celestial reference frames,

*   promote geodetic VLBI techniques and products as an important
contributor/component of global geodetic science and satellite positioning
applications.

*   interact with the domestic and international community of radio
astronomers, geodetic VLBI practitioners, researchers and users of VLBI
products,

*   coordinate, plan, schedule and participate in regional and global VLBI
observing programs.

The Australia Telescope National Facility (ATNF) has its headquarters in
Sydney and operates a VLBI network across Australia, in collaboration with
the University of Tasmania.

Enquiries regarding the position should be addressed to Dr. R. Govind
(RameshGovind@auslig.gov.au) or to Dr. D.L. Jauncey
(djauncey@atnf.csiro.au). Applications marked "confidential" should be sent
to Ramesh Govind on or before January 15 1998.  More information about the
ATNF can be found at http://www.atnf.csiro.au . The ATNF offices in
Canberra are located with the CSIRO Office of Space
Science and Applications (COSSA) and are housed on the campus of the
Australian National University close to the centre of the National Capital.
