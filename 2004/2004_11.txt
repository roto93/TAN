Abstract:         
We present here the first calculation of a spherical self-similar collapse
that leads to a black hole formation.  The dynamic evolution is triggered by
the central portion of a singular isothermal sphere in equilibrium
collapsing to for an infinitesimal black hole.  This perturbation removes
the pressure support for the layer immediately above, which causes it to
collapse, and so on.  The influence of gravitational collapse propagates out
as an expansion wave moving at the speed of sound.  Outside of the expansion
wave, matter remains in local equilibrium.  We have also examined the
effects of a weak and uniform magnetic field on the collapse.  Within the
assumptions of perfect magnetohydrodynamics, the magnetic field lines are
frozen to the collapsing matter, and arrange themselves in the form of a
split magnetic monopole on the large scale.  We believe this theoretical
model can serve to describe monolithic formation of massive black holes, and
the presence of magnetic fields helps to break self-similarity and to define
the final black hole mass.
