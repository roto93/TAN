strict one.
Please visit the CAST web site (<http://www.cast.org.tw>, English version
available) for more details.
In case you still encounter problems when accessing the CAST web pages,
email registration and submission is acceptable.

Subject: [Colloquium] ASIAA Colloquium this Friday (04/02)

 Dear all,

	This is to remind you that this Friday (04/02) we will have a
 colloquium given by Dr. Sujan Kumar Sengupta from Indian Institute of
 Astrophysics. Dr. Senguptu has been visiting us since mid-March and
 gave a talk discussing reflected spectra from extra-solar planets at
 the TIARA Star Formation Seminar a couple weeks ago. This Friday, he
 will introduce his research on somewhat more massive objects - brown 
 dwarfs. Please remember to join!

	More information about the ASIAA colloquia can be found at our
 web url, "http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/act/colloquium.php".

 Regards,
