Dear colleagues,

The Theoretical Institute for Advanced Research in Astrophysics (TIARA) is
organizing its first winter school, to take place from Jan 16 to Jan 30 of
2005 on the campus of National Tsing-Hua University in Hsinchu, Taiwan.
This winter school is intended for advanced undergraduate and beginning
graduate students and offers intensive, in depth, instruction covering the
physical processes that occur in astrophysical disks. Such disks can be very
diverse, having a wide range of length scales. The topics covered by the
lectures will include the observational and theoretical aspects of disks
forming around young stellar objects, the early solar system, and close
binaries on the small scale and in active galactic nuclei and galactic disks
on the large scale. The provisional lecturers include Ron Allen, Michael
Cai, Dong Lai, Steve Lubow, Hsien Shang, Frank Shu, Ronald Taam, Mark
Wardle, and Chi Yuan.

We encourage students from all areas of astrophysics to participate in this
event. In addition to regular lectures, students are also invited to give
oral or poster presentations on their own research. It is our hope that this
will provide an opportunity for the young and seasoned scientists to
exchange ideas and to seek new inspirations.

During the course of the winter school, TIARA will provide the participants
with accommodation and local expenses. Due to limited resources, we can host
up to 30 students, which will be selected by the organizing committee.  The
deadline for application is Dec 25, 2004.  More detailed information can be
found at http://www.tiara.sinica.edu.tw/winterschool/. 

Best regards,
The Organizing Committee
Michael Cai, Hsiang Kuang Chang, Hsien Shang, Ronald Taam, Chi Yuan
