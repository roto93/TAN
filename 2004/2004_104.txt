Subject: [Colloquium] ASIAA Colloquium Friday (06/25)

 Dear all,

	Just to remind you that we will have a colloquium this
 Friday (06/25). Last March during the panel meeting, the schedule
 was too tight for Prof. Ronald Taam, our advisory panel member,
 to give a talk. This time he is visiting for about two weeks
 and will kind offer us two talks. On Friday, he will first talk
 about the neutron star X-ray source population in the Galactic
 center. Please mark your calendar and remember to join.

	More information about the ASIAA colloquia including
 talk abstracts can be found at our web url,

 Regards,

 ------------------------ ASIAA Colloquium ------------------------
  Speaker : Prof. Ronald Taam (Northwestern University)
  Title   : The Neutron Star X-ray Source Population in the Galactic Center
  Time    : 06/25 (Friday) 2:00 PM
  Location: ASIAA Room 716
  URL     : http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/act/colloquium.php
  Abstract:
	Recent deep surveys of the Galactic center region with the
 Chandra Observatory have revealed the existence of a faint, hard
 X-ray source population. While the nature of this population is
 unknown, it is likely that several types of stellar objects contribute.
 Among the sources which are compact objects, both accreting and non
 accreting neutron stars can contribute. The properties of these sources
 and the X-ray emission from these objects is discussed.
