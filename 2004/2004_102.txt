Subject: [Colloquium] ASIAA Colloquium Friday (06/18)

 Dear all,

	We will have a colloquium this Friday (06/18) presented
 by Prof. Yong-Ik Byun from Yonsei University. Prof. Byun had
 been an associate professor at the NCU astronomy department.
 Though moved back to Korea, he remains to be a member of the
 TAOS team and continues to work closely with colleagues in
 Taiwan. On Friday, he will talk about the status of the YSTAR
 survey.

	Please note that due to some scheduling constraints,
 the talk will start from 11:00AM and runs to about lunch time.
 We will order lunch boxes for those who would like to stay
 and chat with Prof. Byun and other TAOS members.
 
	If you need to order a lunch box, please email Linda 
 (lshao@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw) by Friday (06/18) 9:30 AM with
 your choice of dishes (chicken leg, pork rib, beef, fish fillet,
 or veggie).

	More information about the ASIAA colloquia including
 talk abstracts can be found at our web url,

 Regards,
    
 sheng-yuan

 --------------------- ASIAA/IANCU Joint Colloquium ---------------------
  Speaker : Prof. Yong-Ik Byun (Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea)
  Title   : YSTAR Survey
  Time    : 06/18 (Friday) 11:00 AM
  Location: ASIAA Room 716
  URL     : http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/act/colloquium.php
  Abstract:

 YSTAR is a general variability survey based on the same wide-field
 telescopes of TAOS.  We have been operating an unmanned station in South
 Africa for two years, and presently constructing a second station in
 Australia.  Just like TAOS, a lot of effort has been made to ensure safe
 and reliable automated operation of the telescope system.  So far we
 have gathered some 60,000 images for about 4000 square degrees of
 southern sky.   Data analysis is still in progress; our data pipeline is
 not yet fully automated due to difficulties involved with image
 distortions and their impact on astrometry and photometry.
 Nevertheless, we could confirm several interesting possibilities for
 science outcome of this survey, including the discovery of many
 instances of brief optical transients.  Details of our setup and
 strategy will be presented together with early results from our survey
 observations.
