Subject: special education session at CAST meeting

Dear colleagues, 

  I would like to draw your attention of a special session on Astronomy
Education during the coming CAST annual assembly.  In April 25, Sunday, as
the last session starting at 4 pm, we will get together to learn about,
and exchange ideas of, teaching in astronomy at different levels.  
Teachers from elementary, junior high, senior high schools, colleges, and
continuing education will present the curriculum at each level, and share
their experience inside and outside the classrooms.

  Let me urge you to take part in this rare opportunity to listen to
the teachers who stand on the forefront in inspiration of young minds, and
in turn to feed back to them how the community can work together to better
shape up the cross link among different levels of curricuria.  

  We all agree upon the importance of education.  Let us contribute and
show our support.  

  Regards, 

  Wen Ping Chen
