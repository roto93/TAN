Astrochemistry - From Laboratory Studies to Astronomical Observations

Pacifichem 2005 - Symposium 47

Honolulu, Hawai'i, December 15-20, 2005
 

Contents

The formation of molecules in extraterrestrial environments has 
fascinated scientists since the pioneering detection, of CH and CN in 
interstellar space. We now know of about 130 species, ranging in 
complexity from diatomics such as molecular hydrogen to polyatomics like 
the sugar glycolaldehyde, benzene, and cyanopentaacetylene, which have 
been identified as gas-phase constituents of extraterrestrial 
environments. Nevertheless, many facets of the question "How do these 
molecules arise?" remain unanswered or contentious. This symposium 
focuses on the interdisciplinary field of astrochemistry, bringing 
together speakers from the fields of laboratory astrochemistry 
(dynamics, kinetics, and spectroscopy), astrochemical modeling 
(physicists), theoretical astrochemistry (computational chemists), and 
observational astrochemistry (astronomers). By focusing on the interplay 
between observational data, kinetic modeling, and fundamental 
investigations of the details of specific molecular processes, we seek 
also to evaluate the emerging generalized concepts on the formation of 
astrochemically important molecules on the molecular level. Furthermore, 
by exploring the current boundaries of astrochemical knowledge, we can 
more effectively design new laboratory experiments under well-defined 
conditions (and recommend promising directions for further astronomical 
searches) to resolve critical unanswered aspects of molecular synthesis 
in extraterrestrial space on the molecular level. 


Presentations & Proceedings

This symposium features 30 invited talks (30 min each). In addition we 
allocated time slots for 10 contributed talks (15 min each) and poster 
presentations. Registrations and abstracts shall be submitted through 
the Pacifichem Webpage <http://www.pacifichem.org/> 
(http://www.pacifichem.org/) before April 13, 2005. Contributors will be 
notified by May 30, 2005, if submissions have been selected for oral or 
poster presen­ta­tions. Proceedings are published by the American 
Institute of Physics. Additional information (invited speakers, 
submission process) can be found on

Subject: [Colloquium] ASIAA Colloquium This Week (11/05 Friday)


  Dear all,

 	This week, we will have Prof. Takeshi Oka visiting from University
  of Chicago On Thursday, Prof. Oka will first give a talk titled "The
  Ubiquitous H3+" at the IAMS. On Friday, he will offer us a colloquium
  titled

  "Hot and Diffuse Clouds near the Galactic Center Probed by Metastable H3+"

 	Please mark your calendar and remember to join the talk!

  Regards,

  sheng-yuan

   Speaker : Prof. Takeshi Oka (University of Chicago)
   Title   : Hot and Diffuse Clouds near the Galactic Center
                Probed by Metastable H3+
   Time    : 11/05 (Friday) 2:00 PM
   Location: ASIAA Room 716

   Abstract:
              It has been well established mainly from the radio
              observations of CO that the Central Molecular Zone
              (CMZ) of the Galaxy, a region of radius ~ 200 pc,
              contains high density (n >= 10^4 cm^-3) molecular
              gas with a high filling factor of f >=  0.1 and the
              gas constitutes about one tenth of the total interstellar
              matter in the Galaxy (Morris and Serabyn 1996). It
              is also known from the radio spectrum of NH3 that a
              significant fraction of the gas has  high temperature
              (~ 200 K) and large velocity dispersion (15 ~ 50 km s^-1).
              Studies of the gas in the CMZ provide information
              vital for understanding the turbulent activity in
              the core of the Galaxy.

              I report our discovery of low density (n <= 10^2 cm^-3)
              and high temperature (T >= 300 K) gas in the CMZ using
              the infrared absorption spectrum of H3+ in the
              (J,K) = (3,3) metastable level. H3+, discovered in
              interstellar space in 1996 (Geballe and Oka), is a
              unique astrophysical probe in that it is observed with
              comparable column densities (~ 10^14 cm^-2) both in
              dense and diffuse clouds. Since the heavy visual
              extinction of AV = 25 ~ 40 toward the Galactic center
              (GC) is caused mainly by diffuse clouds, H3+ is a
              powerful probe to study sightlines toward the GC.
              I report our observations using the Subaru Telescope
              (Goto et al. 2002), the United Kingdom Infrared
              Telescope, and the Gemini South Telescope of the
              extremely non-thermal rotational distribution of
              H3+ and provide observational evidence for the vast
              amount of hot and diffuse gas in the CMZ based on a
              recent model calculation (Oka and Epp 2004).
