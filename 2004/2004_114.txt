Subject: EAMA6

Dear Colleagues:

The 6th East Asian Meeting of astronomy (EAMA6) will be held in Seoul,
Korea,  in the coming October 18-22.  The first announcement  can be
found at http://astro.snu.ac.kr/~eama6/ . Please visit the website.

EAMA has developed into an important conference series and a forum for
East Asian astronomy community. It has evolved from a simple site-survey
meeting for the "Pan Asian Telescope" into a full-fledged conference of
astronomy in East Asia. The core regions for EAMA , namely, Japan,
China, Korea and Taiwan form a strong regional partnership for
cooperation and coordination of astrophysical research and development
in the area. The meetings also attract people from other parts of Asia
and even Australia. You may still remember that we have sponsored
EAMA5-core meeting in Taipei and Hua Lien 2001 and East Asian Young
Astronomers Meeting (EAYAM) in Taipei, 2003. Now is the Korea's term to
host the meeting.

As one of the SOC members from Taiwan, I would like to urge you to take
part in the meeting. You may register directly on the above website. It
is important that we show our support of EAMA by strong participation,
as much as they did to us previously.  Please note the deadline for the
meeting is 8-31-2004.

Let me know if you have any questions about the meeting.

With best regards,

Chi Yuan
