CALL FOR OBSERVING PROPOSALS

The Lulin One-meter Telescope (LOT) calls for observing time requests for
the 2005A semester which runs from January 1 to June 30.  The CCD camera
Apogee U42 will continue to serve as facility instrument for direct
imaging.  In addition to the set of Bessel BVRI filters, some specialized
comet and nebulocity filters, including a new [SII] filter, are also
available.  The transmission curve of this [SII] filter is available upon
request.  A focal reducer to change from f/8 to f/4, thereby doubling the
FOV, is likely to be ready for the next semester.

Aside from scientific programs, we may also consider "education"
projects for advanced observing classes.  The observing proposal
form can be downloaded from the NCU/IA homepage
(http://www.astro.ncu.edu.tw).   The deadline is December 1, 2004.
