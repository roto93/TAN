Hi Yi-Jehng, 

  Could you circulate through the TAN the following website to publicize
the next International School for Young Astronomers, to be held in Mexico
next summer?

Subject: [Colloquium] ASIAA Colloquium This Week (10/01 Friday)


  Dear all,

 	This Friday, we will have a colloquium presented by
  Dr. Yeong-Shang Loh from University of Colorado. Dr. Loh
  has been working on subjects in the large scale structure
  utilizing various databases such as the SDSS, RCS, as well
  as the RCS-2. On Friday, he will discuss the cross correlation
  of the CMB with the large scale structure.

 	Please mark your calendar and remember to join the talk!

  Regards,

  sheng-yuan

  ------------------------ ASIAA Colloquia ------------------------
   Speaker : Dr. Yeong-Shang Loh (University of Colorado)
   Title   :  Cross-Correlation of the Cosmic Microwave Background with
              Large Scale Structure: Signature of Dark Energy, Hot Gas
              and Point Sources
   Time    : 10/01 (Friday) 2:00 PM
   Location: ASIAA Room 716
   URL     : http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/act/colloquium.php
   Abstract: I will discuss the cross-correlation of the Cosmic Microwave
             Background temperature anisotropies observed by the Wilkinson
             Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) with the projected distribution
             of extended sources in the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS).
             By modelling the theoretical expectation for this signal, we
             could extract the signature of dark energy, hot gas and microwave
             point sources in the cross-correlation. I will also discuss
             outlook for similar studies using SDSS, RCS-2, and future all
             sky photometric survey like Pan-STARRS and LSST.

===============================
Dear Colleagues,

The 1st international workshop on "Cosmology and Structure Formation" will be 
held by Korea Institute for Advanced Study (KIAS) in Seoul, Korea from the 28th 
to the 29th of October 2004. In this year 2004, we are especially in 
celebration of the exciting news that the Korean Scientist Group (KSG) comes to
a new partner of the international project, "Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)".
This workshop in 2004 is devoted only to invited talks by a small number 
eminent scientists from America, Canada, Japan, and Korea, reviewing the most 
lively topics in the field that are closely related to the SDSS. 

You can find all the information and register (deadline: Sept. 30th) at 
http://newton.kias.re.kr/cosmology04/

Best regards,

Jounghun Lee, on behalf of LOC

KIAS Assistant Professor 
School of Physics 
Korean Institute for Advanced Study
