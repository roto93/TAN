Abstract:
Gas-dust disks are found in the central regions in almost all nearby 
galaxies. It is believed that they supply the necessary material to fuel 
the spectacular phenomena of AGNs and starburst activities. In this 
talk, we will present evidences to support this idea. We think the 
presence of a bar, either major or nuclear, can effectively drive the 
matter in the disk to the galactic nucleus and starburst regions to 
energize the activities through a resonance excitation mechanism. We 
will show, by using wavelet methods, that most of central gas-dust disks 
in the nearby galaxies indeed have bar-driven signatures predicted by 
the theory. Furthermore, we use numerical simulations to show how the 
gas disks evolve as a result of bar-driving. In particular, we 
demonstrate the development of gravitational instability as gas 
accumulates to form a dense ring, which, we believe, is the origin of 
observed starburst rings. In some galaxies, a central disk of extremely 
high density  is formed and yet they are extremely stable in Toomre's 
sense. This is possibly the origin of molecular disks commonly observed 
in the nearby galaxies.
