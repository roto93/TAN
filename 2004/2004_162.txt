Subject: [Colloquium] ASIAA Colloquium This Friday (12/17)


  Dear all,

 	This week, we will have Prof. Li-Hong Xu and Prof. Ronald Lees
  visiting from University of New Brunswick in Canada. On Thursday
  afternoon (12/16 3:30PM), Prof. Lees will first give a talk at IAMS
  titled
              "High-Resolution Infrared Spectroscopic Studies of
                1,3-Butadiene, Ammonia, Carbonyl Sulfide and Methanol"

 	On Friday afternoon (12/17 2:00PM), Prof. Xu will offer us a
  talk at IAA titled
              "Laboratory Spectroscopy in Support of
                Astronomical, Cometary and Planetary Applications"

 	Please mark your calendar and join the talks!

  Regards,

  sheng-yuan

   Speaker : Prof. Li-Hong Xu (University of New Brunswick)
   Title   : Laboratory Spectroscopy in Support of
               Astronomical, Cometary and Planetary Applications
   Time    : 12/17 (Friday) 2:00 PM
   Location: ASIAA Room 716

   Abstract:
             High resolution molecular spectroscopy gives detailed
             information about molecular structures and internal
             dynamics, and provides a tool for sensitive detection
             of trace gases. In our work, we seek both fundamental
             understanding of the dynamics of the molecule and
             applications of the results in a variety of areas. In
             this talk, through an example (methanol molecule), we
             will illustrate that the molecules and spectral regions
             studied in our laboratory are not isolated spectroscopic
             problems, but are linked closely to solving specific
             questions in the areas of interstellar clouds, star
             forming regions, cometary spectra, and forest fires
             as well as environmental monitoring.
