              Title : Numerical Simulations For A Gaseous Disk 
                      Driven By A Bar

              Abstract:

              The high resolution observation make people be able to probe
              the structures of galactic centeral region today. 
              A gaseous disk is found in the center region in almost all 
              normal galaxies.

              We would like to study a gaseous disk driven by a bar, 
              which consists of stars. Our approach is using numerical 
              methods. We develop the gas dynamical codes based on Godunov 
              methods and speed up the calculation of self-gravitation
              by fast Fourier method. Those numerical results
              are consistent with one derived by the spiral density wave 
              theory.
              
              In this talk, I will give an introduction of the spiral 
              density wave theory, numerical simulations for Milky Way,
              the numerical method for gas dynamical codes and discuss 
              some problems in numerical simulations.
