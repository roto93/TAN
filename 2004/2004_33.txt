TITLE: Atmospheric extinction correction in multicolor photometry

SPEAKER: Dr Erika Pakstien (Institute of Theoretical Physics and
         Astronomy, Lithuania)

Abstract
========
Atmospheric extinction is a phenomenon which takes place in the Earth's
atmosphere where light of the star is scattered or absorbed by molecules
and other particles. Due to extinction the observed stars seem fainter and
redder than they are in reality. Astronomers have to execute atmospheric
extinction correction for all stellar observations. Only then they can
expect to get right extra-atmospheric stellar parameters. For a precise
atmospheric extinction correction we have to consider the characteristic
and nature of the atmospheric extinction. There are more difficulties
because the amount of the extinction in heterochromatic photometry is
different for various types of stars even in the case when they are
observed at the same zenith distance.  Such second order extinction
effects are especially significant when super-broad photometric passbands
are used in observations.

Subject: [Colloquium] ASIAA Colloquia FRIDAY and NEXT TUESDAY


 Dear all,

	This is just to remind you that today (03/12 Fri) we will have
 the colloquium given by our director, Dr. Sun Kwok. In addition, there 
 will be a special colloquium next Tuesday (03/16) to precede the TIARA
 star formation seminar next Friday (03/19). Dr. Doug Johnstone from the 
 Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics will talk about the photoevaporation
 of disks in both theoretical and observational aspects. Remember to 
 attend these talks!

	More information about the ASIAA colloquia can be found below at
 our web url, "http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/act/colloquium.php".

 Regards,
    
 sheng-yuan
