              Title : Fast CCD Imaging Photometry of the TAOS Project

              Abstract:

              The TAOS project aims to examine the population of the KBOs 
              by detecting stellar occultation events by these small 
              objects at the outer edge of the solar system.  The event 
              duration is expected to be shorter than 1 s, so a
              high sampling rate is required in the CCD data acquisition.  
              Furthermore, the photometric analysis must be highly 
              efficient as the data volume is excessively large.  I will 
              first describe briefly about the TAOS project, its 
              scientific goal, unique instrumentation requirements, and 
              how a masked adaptive aperture photometry has been developed 
              to produce some thousands of light curves simultaneously at 
              sub-second sampling.  I will report on test observations 
              collected so far, which amounts to some 10^5 photometric
              measurements and allows us to estimate the number of the 
              false alarm rate of the experiment.
