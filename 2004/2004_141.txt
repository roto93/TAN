Astrochemistry - From Laboratory Studies to Astronomical Observations

Pacifichem 2005 - Symposium 47

Honolulu, Hawai'i, December 15-20, 2005

 

Contents

 

The formation of molecules in extraterrestrial environments has
fascinated scientists since the pioneering detection, of CH and CN in
interstellar space. We now know of about 130 species, ranging in
complexity from diatomics such as molecular hydrogen to polyatomics like
the sugar glycolaldehyde, benzene, and cyanopentaacetylene, which have
been identified as gas-phase constituents of extraterrestrial
environments. Nevertheless, many facets of the question "How do these
molecules arise?" remain unanswered or contentious. This symposium
focuses on the interdisciplinary field of astrochemistry, bringing
together speakers from the fields of laboratory astrochemistry (dynamics,
kinetics, and spectroscopy), astrochemical modeling (physicists),
theoretical astrochemistry (computational chemists), and observational
astrochemistry (astronomers). By focusing on the interplay between
observational data, kinetic modeling, and fundamental investigations of
the details of specific molecular processes, we seek also to evaluate the
emerging generalized concepts on the formation of astrochemically
important molecules on the molecular level. Furthermore, by exploring the
current boundaries of astrochemical knowledge, we can more effectively
design new laboratory experiments under well-defined conditions (and
recommend promising directions for further astronomical searches) to
resolve critical unanswered aspects of molecular synthesis in
extraterrestrial space on the molecular level. 


Presentations & Proceedings


This symposium features 30 invited talks (30 min each). In addition we
allocated time slots for 10 contributed talks (15 min each) and poster
presentations. Registrations and abstracts shall be submitted through the
Pacifichem Webpage (http://www.pacifichem.org/) before April 13, 2005.
Contributors will be notified by May 30, 2005, if submissions have been
selected for oral or poster presen-ta-tions. Proceedings are published by
the American Institute of Physics. Additional information (invited
speakers, submission process) can be found on
