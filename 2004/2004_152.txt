  Dear all,

 	My apology for a typo in our speaker's last name in my
  previous notice.

  	This week, we will have a TIARA guest, Dr. Pak-Shing Li
  visiting from the University of California, Berkeley. Dr. Li
  has been working on numerical studies of various subjects, such
  as stellar winds and galactic dynamics. On Friday, he will share
  with us his recent results in the numerical study of star forming
  cores.

  	Please mark your calendar and remember to join the talk!

  Regards,

  sheng-yuan
