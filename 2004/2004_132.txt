Dear Colleagues,

The 1st international workshop on "Cosmology and Structure Formation" will be 
held by Korea Institute for Advanced Study (KIAS) in Seoul, Korea from the 28th 
to the 29th of October 2004. In this year 2004, we are especially in celebration 
of the exciting news that the Korean Scientist Group (KSG) comes to a new 
partner 
of the international project, "Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)". This workshop 
in 
2004 is devoted only to invited talks by a small number eminent scientists from 
America, Canada, Japan, and Korea, reviewing the most lively topics in the field 
that are closely related to the SDSS. 

You can find all the information and register (deadline: Sept. 30th) at 
http://newton.kias.re.kr/cosmology04/

Best regards,

Jounghun Lee, on behalf of LOC

KIAS Assistant Professor 
School of Physics 
Korean Institute for Advanced Study
