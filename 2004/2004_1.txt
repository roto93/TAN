Abstract

Clusters of galaxies are among the largest scale structures
in the Universe. The general characteristics of these objects 
will be reviewed. Observations with EUVE, ROSAT, and BeppoSAX 
have shown that some clusters of galaxies produce intense EUV 
emission. These observations have produced considerable interest; 
over 100 papers have been published on this topic in the refereed 
literature.

The more notable suggestions as to the source
of this radiation include a "warm" (10^6 K) intracluster medium which, 
if present, would constitute the major baryonic component of the 
universe, and inverse Compton scattering of cosmic microwave background 
photons against low energy cosmic rays. The source of these particles 
has been suggested to be an old (~Giga year) population of cluster 
cosmic rays; particles associated with relativistic jets in the cluster; 
and cascading particles produced by shocks from sub-cluster merging. 

The observational situation is equally uncertain with many reports of 
detections which have been subsequently contradicted by analyses carried 
out by other groups. Evidence supporting a thermal and a non-thermal 
origin have been reported. The existing EUV, FUV, and optical data are 
reviewed and clarified. A new source mechanism has just been proposed 
that satisfies all aspects of the observations. This model will be 
discussed in the context of the data.
