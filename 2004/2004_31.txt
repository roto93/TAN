TITLE: Atmospheric extinction correction in multicolor photometry

SPEAKER: Dr Erika Pakstien (Institute of Theoretical Physics and
         Astronomy, Lithuania)

Abstract
========
Atmospheric extinction is a phenomenon which takes place in the Earth's
atmosphere where light of the star is scattered or absorbed by molecules
and other particles. Due to extinction the observed stars seem fainter and
redder than they are in reality. Astronomers have to execute atmospheric
extinction correction for all stellar observations. Only then they can
expect to get right extra-atmospheric stellar parameters. For a precise
atmospheric extinction correction we have to consider the characteristic
and nature of the atmospheric extinction. There are more difficulties
because the amount of the extinction in heterochromatic photometry is
different for various types of stars even in the case when they are
observed at the same zenith distance.  Such second order extinction
effects are especially significant when super-broad photometric passbands
are used in observations.
