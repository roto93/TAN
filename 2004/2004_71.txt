Abstract: 
 Now we know that large number of minor bodies exist in the outer solar
 system. These objects are called TNOs (Trans-Neptunian Objects) or
 EKBOs (Edgeworth-Kuiper Belt Objects), and they are thought to be
 remnants of planetesimals from which the major objects in the solar
 system formed. Due to their large heliocentric distances, TNOs are
 least thermally affected by radiation from the Sun. Because of their
 primordial characteristics, it is important to know the basic
 properties of the TNOs, such as size distribution, spatial
 distribution and physical properties in order to understand the origin
 and evolution of the solar system. In particular, their orbital
 distribution depends on the formation and orbital evolution of the gas
 giant planets, the depletion of the proto-solar nebula, and also on
 the accretion and collisional history of the planetesimals. We have
 carried out deep imaging survey to study the populations of faint TNOs
 using Subaru telescope with its prime focus camera "Suprime-Cam". We
 will present the faint-end of the luminosity function of TNOs and the
 non-detection of bodies beyond 50 AU. Our results suggest smaller TNOs
 (D < 200 km) have smaller differential power-law index of q ~ 3.5 for
 the size distribution, while larger bodies have steeper distribution.
