Dear TANists,

As Taiwan's (ROC:-) astronomy increasing its size in such a fast pace since
1996 when TAN was first established with fewer than 30 members, TAN has had
a hard time to keep track of every individual -- especially those newly
minted PhDs and oversea graduate students.

Currently there are 175 entries maintained by TAN, including group alias
such as asall@astro.ncu.edu.tw of NCU. It would be great if NTHU, NTU and
NCKU could create similar group mailing aliases for their graduate students.
Anyway, it's just a plea.

So if you know anyone who should be but is not included in TAN, please kindly
inform TAN for a timely mailing list update.

Really appreciate all your help and time.

Best Regards,
Yi-Jehng Kuan
TAN administrator

ps: For the purpose of "reaching out", this particular issue is also directed
    to "iaa@asiaa", so if you received more than one copy, please don't panic;
    by the mean time, if you are associated with ASIAA but this is the first
    time you receive TAN, it means you are NOT in the TAN list currently.
    If you'd like to be included, please let TAN know as well, TAN will be
    happy to add you in.
