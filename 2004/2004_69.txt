1) GENERALITIES
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 The first LabAstro Workshop was organized at Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center in October 2001, where many interesting and stimulating ideas were
exchanged and discussed. One major outcome of that kick-off meeting was
the formation of an international (SLAC/Utah/CosPA) collaboration to
perform a LabAstro experiment on the calibration of the air shower
fluorescence (FLASH), which is essential to the physics of ultra high
energy cosmic ray detection, and is beening  successfully carried out at
SLAC. There are also other independent LabAstro experiments currently
under investigations in various laboratories around the world.       
 

It is thus timely that we, who are seriously interested in Laboratory
Astrophysics, get together again to review the progress of the ongoing
LabAstro experiments, to explore additional science cases, and to develop
possible collaboration(s) on LabAstro experiments beyond FLASH and other
current experiments. The Center for Cosmology and Particle Astrophysics
(CosPA) at <?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns =
"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" />National Taiwan University
(Taida) will be the hosting institution for this interesting Second
LabAstro Workshop.

 


  2) SCIENTIFIC PROGRAM
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   The topics to be covered include:


 A. Astro Calibration Experiments:
    Shower air fluorescence and lateral profile in UHECR detections;
    Askaryan effect for cosmic neutrino detections;
    X-ray polarimetry characterizations for compact astro object studies;
    Other novel ideas

 B. Astro Dynamics Experiments:
    Cosmic particle acceleration experiments;
    Astro jet dynamics experiments;
    Testing equation of states of supernova, etc.;
    Supernova-induced electroweak plasma instabilities;
    Additional ideas

 C. Probing Fundamental Physics Experiments:
    Testing Hawking-Unruh effect;
    Probing large extra dimensions;
    Novel concpets for cosmic neutrino background detection;
    Detection of spacetime granularity;
    Astro nuclear transmutation experiments;
    Other novel ideas
