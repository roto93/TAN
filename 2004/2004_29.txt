Subject: [Colloquium] ASIAA Colloquium this week - Dr. Sun Kwok

 Dear all,

	Just to remind you that the colloquium this week will be given by 
 our director, Dr. Sun Kwok. This will be a great opportunity for us to
 get to know more in detail about his research :) So, remember to be there 
 on Friday!

 Abstract:
 ---------
 The recent development of observing capabilities in the x-ray, UV,
 infrared, and submillimeter parts of the electromagnetic spectrum,
 especially through observations from space, has identified many radiation
 processes not possible in the terrestrial environment.  The low density of
 interstellar space has allowed the emission of photons from metstable
 states of atoms and ions, as well as from unstable molecular species such
 as radicals.  In this talk, we will present a brief overview of how modern
 astronomical observations from the radio to the x-ray have served 
 successfully as laboratories of atomic and molecular physics.
