Subject: [Colloquium] ASIAA Colloquium This Week (10/01 Friday)


  Dear all,

 	This Friday, we will have a colloquium presented by
  Dr. Yeong-Shang Loh from University of Colorado. Dr. Loh
  has been working on subjects in the large scale structure
  utilizing various databases such as the SDSS, RCS, as well
  as the RCS-2. On Friday, he will discuss the cross correlation
  of the CMB with the large scale structure.

 	Please mark your calendar and remember to join the talk!

  Regards,

  sheng-yuan

   Title   :  Cross-Correlation of the Cosmic Microwave Background with
              Large Scale Structure: Signature of Dark Energy, Hot Gas
              and Point Sources
   Time    : 10/01 (Friday) 2:00 PM
   Location: ASIAA Room 716

   Abstract: I will discuss the cross-correlation of the Cosmic Microwave
             Background temperature anisotropies observed by the Wilkinson
             Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) with the projected distribution
             of extended sources in the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS).
             By modelling the theoretical expectation for this signal, we
             could extract the signature of dark energy, hot gas and microwave
             point sources in the cross-correlation. I will also discuss
             outlook for similar studies using SDSS, RCS-2, and future all
             sky photometric survey like Pan-STARRS and LSST.
