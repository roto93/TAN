Subject: [Colloquium] ASIAA Colloquium next week - Dr. Peter Bernath 


 Dear all,
 
 	This is to remind you that there will a colloquium on the coming
 Friday (02/13). Dr. Peter Bernath is visiting from University of Waterloo 
 from 02/07 (Sat) to 02/14 (Sat). On next Friday , he will talk about
 molecular astronomy and laboratory astrophysics in the infrared band.
 In addition to this talk, he will also give two other colloquia, one
 at  NSPO on 02/11 (Wed) on a topic in space and atmospheric science,
 and the other one at IAMS on 02/12 (Thu) on a topic in chemical physics.
 
  	More information about these colloquia talks can be found below
 and at our web url, "http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/act/colloquium.php"
   
 	So, beside your busy schedule with the annual physics meeting
 in NTHU next week, please do mark your calendar and remember to join 
 these exciting talks!
 
 Regards,
