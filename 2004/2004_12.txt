Subject: postdoctoral position astrochemistry

A postdoctoral position in experimental physical chemistry (reaction 
dynamics, low temperature kinetics on ice surfaces, reactive scattering) 
is open at the Department of Chemistry, University of Hawai'i at Manoa, 
for the period of one year, renewable upon mutual agreement. Successful 
applicants should have a significant background in experimental reaction 
dynamics, molecular beams, vacuum technology, and laser systems. The 
prime directive of the experimental research program is to investigate 
the dynamics of bimolecular gas phase reactions and of reactions on 
surfaces to form complex molecules in extraterrestrial environments. A 
description of the current research group and projects can be found at 
http://www.chem.hawaii.edu/Bil301/welcome.html ; recent examples of our 
work are published in , for example, Chemical Reviews (102, 1309-1358, 
2002) and Int. Rev. Physical Chemistry (21, 307-356, 2002). To apply, 
please send a letter of interest, three letters of recommendation, CV, 
and publication list to Prof. Ralf I. Kaiser, Department of Chemistry, 
University of Hawai'i at Manoa, Honolulu, HI 96822-2275, USA, or via 
email to kaiser@gold.chem.hawaii.edu . Review of applications will start 
March 1, 2004, and continues until the position is filled.
