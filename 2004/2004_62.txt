              Title : Fast CCD Imaging Photometry of the TAOS Project

              Abstract:

              The TAOS project aims to examine the population of the KBOs 
              by detecting stellar occultation events by these small 
              objects at the outer edge of the solar system.  The event 
              duration is expected to be shorter than 1 s, so a
              high sampling rate is required in the CCD data acquisition.  
              Furthermore, the photometric analysis must be highly 
              efficient as the data volume is excessively large.  I will 
              first describe briefly about the TAOS project, its 
              scientific goal, unique instrumentation requirements, and 
              how a masked adaptive aperture photometry has been developed 
              to produce some thousands of light curves simultaneously at 
              sub-second sampling.  I will report on test observations 
              collected so far, which amounts to some 10^5 photometric
              measurements and allows us to estimate the number of the 
              false alarm rate of the experiment.

Dear Yi-Jehng,

Please forward the following message to TAN.
Since we need to count the number of attendances (the closing date
of reply is this Friday), the sooner distribution is the better.

Thank you for your cooperation,

<< Special SMA user session in the CAST meeting >>

Dear colleagues, 

We are planning to have a special session on the Submillimeter Array (SMA) 
during the comming CAST meeting.

The SMA was commissioned in November 2003, and the SAO, IfA, and ASIAA is
currently conducting scientific observations with the telescope.  
ASIAA shares 13 % of the obserting time, and we would like to invite you 
to join "the leading science with the SMA". While we are moving towards 
regular scientific observations with the SMA, at this stage familiarity 
with the instrument is required to best use the telescope.


This SMA special session in the CAST meeting is planned in order to 
familarize the community with the SMA. The SMA group members in ASIAA will
introduce the capabilities of the SMA, proposal submission process, and
current organization in ASIAA (** please see the forwarded message from the
ASIAA director, Dr. Kwok). Any questions, requests, and inputs from you
are also welcome.

The possible time of this special session will be 
 1) Apr. 25 (Sun.) 16:20 - 18:00, or
 2) Apr. 25 (Sun.) 18:00 - 19:00.

If you are interested in joining this session, please send e-mail to
me (Naomi Hirano: hirano@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw) or Dr. Sheng-yuan Liu 
(syliu@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw) with the information of your preferable
time before Friday (Apr. 16) evening.

Thank you for your attention,

Naomi Hirano @ ASIAA

** Present organization in ASIAA - the message from Dr. Kwok 

Dear Hsiang Kuang, Wing, Wen Ping, Wei-Hsin, Tzihong, Pauchy, Dean Yi, and 
Yi Jehng:

I am writing to encourage our university colleagues to submit proposals to
SMA.  ASIAA has 13% of the observing time, and does its own time
allocation.  Because of the very small amount of time available, proposals
are submitted from three science groups: star formation, extragalactic,
and evolved stars. This approach is taken to involve the maximum of
people in the use of SMA, and to ensure that SMA will have Taiwan-led
programs.  If your colleagues have ideas on possible projects, I would
like to encourage them to join the discussion groups, which are held
periodically before the proposal deadline.  In the coming CAST meeting, we 
hope to have a special session on SMA to familarize the community with the 
capabilities of SMA.

Please also remember that our share of time on CFHT is also completely 
open, and we welcome proposals from our university colleagues.  In the 
past two semesters, there have been several proposals from universities 
and I hope this strong showing will continue.

If you have any questions, please let me know.  See you in the CAST 
meeting,

Sun
