  ------------------------ ASIAA Colloquia ------------------------
   Speaker : Dr. Boon Chye Low (High Altitude Observatory)
   Title   : The Hydromagnetic Solar Corona
   Time    : 10/28 (Thursday) 2:00 PM
   Location: ASIAA Room 716
   URL     : http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/act/colloquium.php
   Abstract:
 	An overview is given of the solar corona as a hydromagnetic
 	atmosphere evolving in response to the dynamo in the solar
 	interior that reverses the global magnetic field once every 11
 	years.  Flares, prominence eruptions, and coronal mass ejections
 	and other energetic events can be collectively viewed to be a
 	part of a bigger physical picture in which magnetic flux systems
         are bodily transported out of the solar interior, to first reside
 	and evolve in the corona and then eventually be ejected out into
         the interplanetary solar wind.  In this picture, coronal mass
         ejections have a role to play in the reversal of the global
         magnetic field of the corona in each solar cycle.
