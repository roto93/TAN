1) GENERALITIES
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 The first LabAstro Workshop was organized at Stanford Linear =
Accelerator Center in October 2001, where many interesting and =
stimulating ideas were exchanged and discussed. One major outcome of =
that kick-off meeting was the formation of an international =
(SLAC/Utah/CosPA) collaboration to perform a LabAstro experiment on the =
calibration of the air shower fluorescence (FLASH), which is essential =
to the physics of ultra high energy cosmic ray detection, and is beening =
 successfully carried out at SLAC. There are also other independent =
LabAstro experiments currently under investigations in various =
laboratories around the world.       =20
=20

It is thus timely that we, who are seriously interested in Laboratory =
Astrophysics, get together again to review the progress of the ongoing =
LabAstro experiments, to explore additional science cases, and to =
develop possible collaboration(s) on LabAstro experiments beyond FLASH =
and other current experiments. The Center for Cosmology and Particle =
Astrophysics (CosPA) at National Taiwan University (Taida) will be the =
hosting institution for this interesting Second LabAstro Workshop.=20


  2) SCIENTIFIC PROGRAM

Subject: Correction [Colloquium] ASIAA Colloquia Tomorrow (04/27) and Friday
 (04/30)

 Dear all,

	In the previous message, the date for Tuesday appears to be incorrect.

	This is to remind you that tomorrow (04/27) we will have the ASIAA/IANCU
 special joint colloquium presented by Prof. Binney from Oxford University at
 2:00PM.

	In addition to this event, there will ALSO be a regular colloquium 
 on Friday (04/30). Dr. Kotaro Kohno visiting from University of Tokyo will 
 talk about studies of dense molecular gas in Seyfert and starburst galaxies
 with the Nobeyama Millimeter Array, the Rainbow Interferometer, and the 
 ASTE. Please remember to join these talks!

	More information about the ASIAA colloquia, including talk abstracts,
 can be found at our web url,
 	"http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/act/colloquium.php".

 Regards,
    
 sheng-yuan

Title :   Minor Bodies in Outer Solar System

Speaker:  Dr. Kinoshita Daisuke (National Central University)

Date:     30 April 2004 (Friday)

Time:     12:10

Place:    Room 620,  Physics Building, NTHU

Abstract: 
 Now we know that large number of minor bodies exist in the outer solar
 system. These objects are called TNOs (Trans-Neptunian Objects) or
 EKBOs (Edgeworth-Kuiper Belt Objects), and they are thought to be
 remnants of planetesimals from which the major objects in the solar
 system formed. Due to their large heliocentric distances, TNOs are
 least thermally affected by radiation from the Sun. Because of their
 primordial characteristics, it is important to know the basic
 properties of the TNOs, such as size distribution, spatial
 distribution and physical properties in order to understand the origin
 and evolution of the solar system. In particular, their orbital
 distribution depends on the formation and orbital evolution of the gas
 giant planets, the depletion of the proto-solar nebula, and also on
 the accretion and collisional history of the planetesimals. We have
 carried out deep imaging survey to study the populations of faint TNOs
 using Subaru telescope with its prime focus camera "Suprime-Cam". We
 will present the faint-end of the luminosity function of TNOs and the
 non-detection of bodies beyond 50 AU. Our results suggest smaller TNOs
 (D < 200 km) have smaller differential power-law index of q ~ 3.5 for
 the size distribution, while larger bodies have steeper distribution.
