Subject: [Colloquium] ASIAA Colloquium This Week (10/15 Friday)


  Dear all,

 	This Friday, we are happy to have our director Dr. Sun Kwok
  for the a colloquium presentation on the research with the Odin
  satellite. The Odin satellite is an internationally joint mission
  of a telescope operating in the submillimeter range, particularly
  the first one with tunable receivers! Dr. Kwok will introduce the
  science highlights done with this satellite.

 	Please mark your calendar and remember to join the talk!

  Regards,

   Abstract: The Odin Submillimeter Satellite is a joint mission
             between Sweden, Canada, France and Finland. It is the
             second submillimeter telescope in space (after SWAS),
             and the first with tunable receivers. Odin carries a
             1.1m telescope and 4 submillimeter receivers centered on
             495, 548, 555, and 571 GHz. There is also a millimeter
             receiver at 119 GHz for the ground-state transition of
             oxygen molecule. Odin was successfully launched in February
             2001, and has been operating for over 3 years. In addition
             to the search and observations of water and oxygen molecules,
             Odin has the unique capability to perform the first spectral
             scan in the submillimeter spectral window. I will present
             the highlights of the science results from Odin, with
             specific emphasis on the work done at the University of
             Calgary in Canada.
