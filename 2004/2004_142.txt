   Abstract:
              It has been well established mainly from the radio
              observations of CO that the Central Molecular Zone
              (CMZ) of the Galaxy, a region of radius ~ 200 pc,
              contains high density (n >= 10^4 cm^-3) molecular
              gas with a high filling factor of f >=  0.1 and the
              gas constitutes about one tenth of the total interstellar
              matter in the Galaxy (Morris and Serabyn 1996). It
              is also known from the radio spectrum of NH3 that a
              significant fraction of the gas has  high temperature
              (~ 200 K) and large velocity dispersion (15 ~ 50 km s^-1).
              Studies of the gas in the CMZ provide information
              vital for understanding the turbulent activity in
              the core of the Galaxy.

              I report our discovery of low density (n <= 10^2 cm^-3)
              and high temperature (T >= 300 K) gas in the CMZ using
              the infrared absorption spectrum of H3+ in the
              (J,K) = (3,3) metastable level. H3+, discovered in
              interstellar space in 1996 (Geballe and Oka), is a
              unique astrophysical probe in that it is observed with
              comparable column densities (~ 10^14 cm^-2) both in
              dense and diffuse clouds. Since the heavy visual
              extinction of AV = 25 ~ 40 toward the Galactic center
              (GC) is caused mainly by diffuse clouds, H3+ is a
              powerful probe to study sightlines toward the GC.
              I report our observations using the Subaru Telescope
              (Goto et al. 2002), the United Kingdom Infrared
              Telescope, and the Gemini South Telescope of the
              extremely non-thermal rotational distribution of
              H3+ and provide observational evidence for the vast
              amount of hot and diffuse gas in the CMZ based on a
              recent model calculation (Oka and Epp 2004).
