Dear Dr. Hsiang-Kuang Chang

The next Japanese X-ray astronomy satellite Astro-E2 is being prepared
for the launch in February 2005. As was mentioned in the previous IAU
regional meeting in Japan last year, we plan to receive observation
proposals from all across the world. We would like to notify following
announcement of opportunity (AO-1) of Astro-E2 observations to the
astrophysicists in Taiwan.

There are two remarks. Researchers in countries other than USA or ESA
member states have to submit proposals to ISAS, Japan according to this
announcement. One more thing is that this is a program to enhance
international collaboration with Japanese astronomers. Japanese co-I's
are recommended. If there is no one available, we will introduce
Japanese advisors to successful proposals, later.

It is greatly appreciated if you circulate this AO among your
colleagues or friends who may be interested in this opportunity.

										With best wishes,

										Hideyo Kunieda

=====================================================
Announcement of Opportunity (AO-1) of Astro-E2
------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------
1. Overview
   This is an announcement for researchers affiliated with
institutions or universities located in Japan or countries other than
USA or ESA member states, soliciting proposals for participation in
the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science/Japan Aero-space
Exploration Agency (ISAS/JAXA) program for conducting observations
with the Astro-E2 X-ray observatory, currently scheduled for launche
in February, 2005. The AO-1 covers a 1-year of observations beginning
in September, 2005.

   US based scientists should consult the parallel announcement at

http://astroe.gsfc.nasa.gov/

while scientists in ESA member countries should consult the version at

http://www.rssd.esa.int/Astro-E2

   This version is applicable to scientists based in all other
countries. We would like to enhance scientific cooperation between
non-US or non-ESA and Japanese scientists. Thus, PIs affiliated
with institutions located in other countries than USA , ESA Member
States or Japan are also eligible to propose for Astro-E2 guest
investigations through ISAS/JAXA according to the present
announcement.


2. Astro-E2 X-ray observatory
   The mission is equipped with five high throughput X-ray telescopes
(XRTs) to cover up to 12 keV. A high resolution spectrometer (XRS) and
four CCD cameras (XISs) are placed at foci of the telescopes. A hard
X-ray detector (HXD) points in the same direction as the XRTs and
covers up to 600 keV. The major features of Astro-E2 are its high
energy resolution (E/dE ~ 1000 at 6 keV) and its broad energy coverage
from 0.2 to 600 keV. Because the life time of the XRS cryogen is
limited (estimated to be about 2.5 years), it is suggested that
emphasis will be placed upon observations requiring the cryogenically
cooled XRS during the early phase. The detailed mission description
can be found in the following web site:

http://www.astro.isas.jaxa.jp/astroe


3. Mission phases and time allocation
   The operational phases consist of three distinct phases which are
divided into sub-phases.

   Phase-0: Covers the first month when the basic functions of the
satellite will be tested and initial operations are started for all
scientific instruments by extending the optical bench and opening the
doors.

   Phase-I starts when the mission is ready for scientific observations
and lasts until the XRS becomes unable to observe because of the lack
of cryogen, roughly 2.5 years after the launch. It will be divided
into three or four sub-phases (Ia-Ic; Id will be added if the cryogen
lifetime exceeds 2.5 years). In Phase-II, the XRS will no longer be
available so that only the XIS and HXD will be operated. Observations
will be conducted along with the observation plans by the Science
Working Group (SWG) of Astro-E2, Japanese AO, US AO and proposals from
across the world, with time alloted as summarized in the following
table. A portion of Japanese time has been allocated to ESA observers.
Non-US and non-ESA observers are solicited to propose to the Japanese
time (present AO).

Phase (terms)       SWG     Japan       US        J/US
                             (ESA)
Phase-0(0-1 Mo)	     0%      0 %         0%          0%
Phase-Ia(2-7 Mo)   100       0           0           0
Phase-Ib(8-19 Mo)   25      37.5 (6)    32.5         5
Phase Ic(20-31 Mo)  15      42.5 (7)    37.5         5
Phase Id(32-? Mo)    0      50 (8)      37.5        12.5
Phase-II             0      60 (10)     30          10

   The present announcement covers observations for Phase-Ib. Of the
total observation time, 5% will be reserved for maintenance and
calibration purposes while 3% will be reserved for target of
opportunity (TOO) observations. The remaining observation time will
be allocated as shown in the table. In this AO-1 (Phase-Ib), the
actual observation time is estimated to be 3,860 ksec for Japanese time
excluding the ESA portion. In the merging process, if two individual
proposals are recommended in US and Japan for the same target, they
will be merged, when both PI's presented their wish to collaborate on
the application form. Proposals from non-US, non-ESA countries will be
accepted in the Japanese time up to the ESA portion.


4. Observing Constraints
   The Astro-E2 SWG has decided the target list of observations for the
SWG time in Phase-Ia and Ib. Proposals to observe targets in this list
will not be accepted without a strong justification, such as a much
longer exposure, different pointing within an extended object, or
different observing window of a variable object.

   The length of the observation time in the proposal must be justified
by showing the feasibility with simulations. The minimum allowed
exposure time of an observation is 10 ksec due to operational
constraints. While in principle there is no upper limit to the
exposure, proposals with longer exposure times should address more
important science, in general.

   Observation times can be requested for a specific time (such as for
specific binary phase) or for simultaneous campaigns (time critical
observations). Target of opportunity (TOO) observations can be
proposed for those objects with a high scientific importance that
involve rapidly evolving phenomena whose occurrence cannot be
predicted accurately. Such a proposal should state specific target
names, position, triggering conditions, duration of events and the
possibility of occurrence. Proposals for generic TOOs (e.g., the next
Galactic supernova) are not allowed through this process. A separate
mechanism will be established for such unpredictable targets. For
gamma-ray bursts, the SWG has allocated 200 ksec to perform
coordinated observations following alerts from other monitoring
satellites. Therefore, no other proposals will be accepted for
gamma-ray bursts.


5. Review process and schedule
   Proposals may be submitted from May 18 through August 18. They will
be reviewed by a board of scientists in the fields of X-ray
astrophysics and other relevant fields. After adding ESA proposals,
the selected target list will be merged with the list selected in the
US. The final list will be announced in December 2004. Accepted
targets are prioritized in three categories. Priority A targets must
be observed during the term. Priority B targets will be observed
during the term but could be carried over to the next term. Priority C
targets can be observed if there is a slot of observation time, but
will not be carried over to the following term if they are not
observed during the current term. The fraction of observation time is
A:B:C = 50% : 40% : 50% (40% more than the available time). TOO and
time critical observations should be scientifically more important
(category ``A'' targets).


6. Data rights
   The data will be delivered to the successful proposer after standard
processing has been carried and will go into the public domain one
year after the delivery of data to the proposer. The data of the
Phase-Ia (100% SWG time) will be open to public at the end of
Phase-Ib. The data of generic TOO's and gamma-ray bursts observed in
the mission TOO time and SWG time will belong to the Astro-E2 team for
one year at least during Phase-Ia and Ib).


==================Proposal Submission========================
1. Observations
   X-ray observations with Astro-E2 observatory from September 2005
through August 2006.

2. Who may propose
   Principal investigators (PI's) have to be affiliated with
institutions or universities located in Japan or countries other than
US or ESA member states. PI's at US institutions and those in ESA
member states should submit to NASA or ESA, respectively. PI's in
other countries should send proposals to Japan.
When a graduate student is a PI, his/her supervisor should be assigned
as a Co-nvestigators. Scientists, who stay in US or in ESA member states
by a fund from Japanese organizations, are able to submit to
ISAS or  NASA/ESA.
The requirement of affiliation with above institution does not
extend to Co-Investigators. In case of proposals from coutries
other than  Japan, US, and ESA member countries, collaboration
with Japanese colleagues is strongly encouraged. Proposals
without Japanese co-I's can  be submitted, and some Japanese
advisors will be introduced after the acceptance.


3. Due date of proposals
   12:00 JST (03:00 UT) on August 18, 2004. Printed material should be
postmarked no later than this date in Japan. In case of posting from
outside of Japan, express air mail should be used.

4. Proposal format
   The following two items are both necessary.

(1) RPS (Remote Proposal Submission system) submission: Note that the
observation parameters in the electrical form must be accurate because
they will be forwarded on-line to the satellite operation system.

(2) 7 sets of hard copy of the proposal have to be submitted to the
following address:

Hideyo Kunieda
Institute of Space and Astronautical Science
Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency
3-1-1, Yoshinodai, Sagamihara
