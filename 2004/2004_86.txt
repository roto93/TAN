Subject: SMA Call for Proposals

 
ASIAA invites the astronomical community of Taiwan to submit proposals to 
use our share of SMA's observing time.  The deadline for next proposal
period is June 8.  A guideline for preparation of proposals is attached 
below.


A guideline for submitting SMA proposals

The Submillimeter Array (SMA), consisting of eight 6 m radio telescopes 
located at the top of Mauna Kea, Hawaii, USA, has been dedicated in 
November 2003. Since then, we have been increasing the use of the SMA for 
scientific observations, although we still spend significant of our time 
to test, improve, or upgrade the instruments. Since the SMA is a 
state-of-the-art observational tool and the first imaging array working at 
submillimeter wavelengths, ASIAA would like to call for proposals or ideas 
for the SMA observations extensively from the Taiwan community. While we 
welcome proposals from the community, we should note that

1.	Although the SMA has started producing good scientific results, 
various features of the array are still being tested or remain to be 
implemented: we will install 6 more Rx bands in addition to the 2 RX bands 
(230 GHz and 345 GHz) working on the 8 antennas at this moment; simultaneous
observations with two RX bands are still under planning; we also need to 
improve the performance of the array, such as pointing of the telescopes. 
We therefore spend two nights per week to work on various testing. Until 
necessary tests are completed and outstanding features are implemented, it 
is important for each SMA user to seek a proper understanding of the 
present capabilities of the array and its limitations.

2.	The share of the ASIAA is 13% of the whole SMA time. In the 1st 
semester (Dec., 2003-Mar., 2004), the ASIAA got 8 successful tracks (each 
track lasts a full night or a half night, e.g., 5-10 hours, depending on 
the source availability.). ASIAA's share is not obviously big enough for 
us to have many programs in each semester. 

Taking into consideration of these constraints, ASIAA has decided to 
undertake a separate time allocation committee (TAC) from SAO to allocate 
our share of the SMA time.  We also established the mechanism of having

three science groups (galaxies, star-formation, and evolved stars) to 
prepare and rank proposals.  Through this mechanism, we hope to achieve 
the following objectives: (i) to involve as many people as possible in SMA 
than it is possible through individual proposals; (ii) maximize the 
scientific return from our limited share of observing time through a 
thorough discussion of the science and technical feasibility; and (iii) to 
ensure that Taiwan plays a leading (not a subordinate) role in SMA science.  

The same principles will apply for proposals from outside of ASIAA.  We 
would like to suggest the following procedures:

A.   Whenever you have an idea of SMA observations, talk to the contact 
person of one of the 3 science groups above mentioned as soon as possible, 
according to the category of your proposal (e.g., extragalactic, star 
formation, or evolved stars). We strongly encourage you to have a close 
collaboration with people in the ASIAA-SMA team. The contact person will 
help you to seek internal collaborators if you would like. If the subject 
of your proposal falls into none of the 3 categories, or you are not sure, 
please contact Nagayoshi Ohashi (ohashi@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw).

B.   We ensure that your idea/proposal will be discussed at group 
meetings and you are strongly encouraged to attend these meetings. Because
each group eventually ranks the proposals submitted under their subject
area, each proposal is discussed extensively at group meetings in the
lead-up to the proposal deadline. The purpose of these discussions is to
sharpen the science objectives, address any technical hurdles, and garner
support for the proposal.  It is therefore critical for you or your 
collaborators to present your ideas at group meetings.

C.   All proposals should be submitted to sma-proposal@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw
by the proposal deadline at each semester. Each group will rank proposals
discussed at their group meetings and ASIAA-TAC will make the final ranking.
Proposals, which fall into none of the 3 categories, will be evaluated and
ranked by the ASIAA-TAC, as needed.

Actual observations at the SMA will be made according to the priority list 
made by the ASIAA-TAC, but all proposals will be shared-risk, with no 
guarantee of observations, and no claim to make up observations in future
proposal periods, regardless its priority.

Even if you do not submit any proposals, you are very welcome to join
discussions at each group. We will announce schedules of each group 
meeting to discuss proposals as well as the proposal deadline for each 
semester.
