CALL FOR OBSERVING PROPOSALS

The Lulin One-meter Telescope (LOT) calls for observing time 
requests for the 2004B semester which runs from July 1 to 
December 31.  For CCD imaging, in addition to the PI 1300B 
camera, a new CCD camera Apogee U42 can also be used, both 
with > 1 MHz readout.  A new set of Bessel BVRI filters and 
a high-quality H-alpha filter --- all with their transmission 
curves scanned already in the lab --- are available.  Other 
filters (e.g., nebular and cometary lines) can also be requested. 

In addition to scientific programs, we may also consider "education" 
projects for advanced observing classes.  The observing proposal 
form can be downloaded from the NCU/IA homepage 
(http://www.astro.ncu.edu.tw).  The deadline is June 1, 2004.
