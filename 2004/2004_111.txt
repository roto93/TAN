Dear Prof. Ip and Prof. Chou;
The Institute of Astronomy,
National Central University, Taiwan
CC: Kuiyun and Yuji Urata

The next Japanese X-ray astronomy satellite Astro-E2 is being prepared
for launch in February 2005. As was mentioned in the IAU  regional
meeting in Japan last year, we plan to invite Asian/Pacific scientists
to participate in the  Astro-E2 observations. We would therefore
appreciate if the attached announcement of opportunity (AO-1) is
circulated among your colleagues and friends who may be interested. You
may circulate the information via the astromer's network in Taiwan, of
which you gave me the information the other day.

There are two remarks. One is that this announcement is meant to those
scientists in countries other than USA or ESA member states, and the
proposals should be submitted through ISAS, Japan. The other is that
this AO involves an attempt to enhance international collaboration of
Japanese astronomers. Therefore, we encourage you to include Japanese
co-I's in your proposals. We, either at the University of Tokyo or
RIKEN, are willing to serve as your counterparts if the research subject
is suitable to us.

The AO-1 due date is August 18; Please excuse me for this short notice.

With best wishes,

Kazuo Makishima

===============================================================
ANNOUNCEMENT OF OPPORTUNITY (AO-1)  FOR  ASTRO-E2 OBSERVATIONS
===============================================================

------------
1. Overview
------------
   This is an announcement of opportunity (AO) for participation in the
observations with the Astro-E2 X-ray observatory. The AO is based on a
program of Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS), which
constitutes a division of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA).
Astro-E2 is currently scheduled for launch in February, 2005. The
present AO, called AO-1, covers a 1-year observing period beginning in
September 2005.

This particular version of AO-1 applies when scientists in countries
other than the USA or the ESA member countries submit proposals for
Astro-E2 observations, through the ISAS/JAXA channel. For reference, US
based scientists should consult the parallel announcement at
http://astroe.gsfc.nasa.gov/ , while those in the ESA member countries
should consult the version at http://www.rssd.esa.int/Astro-E2 .

------------------------------
2. Astro-E2 X-ray Observatory
------------------------------
   The mission is equipped with five high throughput X-ray telescopes
(XRTs) to cover up to 12 keV. A high resolution spectrometer (XRS) and
four CCD cameras (XISs) are placed at foci of the telescopes. A hard
X-ray detector (HXD) points in the same direction as the XRTs and covers
up to 600 keV. The major features of Astro-E2 are its high energy
resolution (E/dE ~ 1000 at 6 keV) and its broad energy coverage from 0.2
to 600 keV. Because the life time of the XRS cryogen is limited
(estimated to be about 2.5 years), proposals at early mission phases
(including AO-1 in particular) should emphasize the necessity to utilize
the cryogenically cooled XRS. The detailed mission description can be
found in the web site  http://www.astro.isas.jaxa.jp/astroe .

--------------------------------------
3. Mission Phases and Time Allocations
--------------------------------------
   There are three distinct operational phases, which are further
divided into sub-phases.

   Phase-0 covers the first month after the launch, when the basic
functions of the satellite are tested, the optical bench is extended,
and all scientific instruments become operational.
   Phase-I starts when the mission is ready for scientific observations
and lasts until the XRS runs out of the cryogen, which is expected to be
roughly 2.5 years after the launch. It will be divided into three or
four sub-phases (Ia-Ic; Id will be added if the cryogen lifetime exceeds
2.5 years).
   In Phase-II, the XRS will no longer be available so that only the XIS
and HXD will be operated.

   The table below summarizes how the overall observing time in each
phase is divided among the Japanese AO, US AO, and observations
exclusive to the Science Working Group (SWG) of Astro-E2. A portion of
the Japanese AO time is allotted to the ESA observers. Non-US and
non-ESA observers (i.e., the present AO) are solicited to propose to the
Japanese time (present AO), and they can be accepted up to an upper
limit which is equal to the ESA portion.

Phase (terms)       SWG     Japan       US        J/US
                             (ESA)
Phase-0(0-1 Mo)      0%      0 %         0%          0%
Phase-Ia(2-7 Mo)   100       0           0           0
Phase-Ib(8-19 Mo)   25      37.5 (6)    32.5         5
Phase Ic(20-31 Mo)  15      42.5 (7)    37.5         5
Phase Id(32-? Mo)    0      50 (8)      37.5        12.5
Phase-II             0      60 (10)     30          10

   The present announcement covers observations for Phase-Ib. Of the
total observation time, 5% will be reserved for maintenance and
calibration purposes (observatory time), while another 3% for target of
opportunity (TOO) observations. The remaining observation time will be
allocated as shown in the table. In this AO-1 (Phase-Ib), the actual
observation time is estimated to be 3,860 ksec for Japanese time
excluding the ESA portion.

  Two proposals for the same target, one from Japan and the other from
US, may be merged together, on condition that both PI's present on the
application form their wishes to collaborate, and that the merging
committee recommends to do so. Otherwise, at least either one of the two
will be rejected.


-------------------------
4. Observing Constraints
-------------------------
4.1 The SWG targets
   The Astro-E2 SWG has already selected  a list of targets for the SWG
time in Phase-Ia and Ib. A proposal to observe one or more targets in
this list will not be accepted, unless it has a strong justification for
a separate observation. These include a much longer exposure, different
pointing(s) for an extended object, different observing window of a
variable object, and so on. The SWG target list is available at
http://www.astro.isas.jaxa.jp/astroe/proposal/swg/swg_lst.html

4.2 Exposure times
   The length of the observation time in the proposal must be justified
by showing the feasibility with simulations. While in principle there is
no upper limit to the exposure, proposals with longer exposure times in
general have less chance to be accepted, unless it successfully
addresses more important science. A typical single proposal may request
an overall exposure of 30 ksec to 100 ksec.
   A proposal may consist of pointings onto multiple targets, or
multiple exposures onto a single object, or both. None of these
pointings should be shorter than 10 ksec, since frequent attitude
maneuverings reduce the observing efficiency and increase the
operational complication. Short exposures are discouraged from
scientific viewpoints as well, because such observations often end up
with insufficient data statistics, and hence poor scientific outcome.
Therefore, a single proposal should incorporate no more than several
targets.

4.3 Sun angle constraints
   At a given time, Astro-E2 can be pointed to rather limited sky
regions, of which the angle is in the range 90 +/- (typically) 25
degrees from the sun. For example, anti-sun directions can never be
observed. Any object in the sky can be observed at least twice in a
year, but the length of each "Viewing Window" depends on the ecliptic
latitude in such a way that a higher-latitude regions have longer
windows.
   A proposal can be "time critical", by requesting observations at
specific epochs (such as a specific binary phase) or coordinating
simultaneous campaigns. A proposer, however, must carefully examine in
advance whether the proposed target meets the sun angle constraint at
the planned observing epoch.

4.4 TOO
  Target of opportunity (TOO) observations can be proposed for those
objects which involve rapidly evolving, yet unpredictable phenomena,
like a nova outburst, on condition that it has a high scientific
importance. Such a proposal should state specific target names,
position(s), triggering conditions, expected duration of the events, and
the probability of occurrence. Proposals for generic TOOs (e.g., the
next Galactic supernova) are not allowed through this process: a
separate mechanism will be established for such unpredictable targets.
   For gamma-ray bursts, the SWG has allocated 200 ksec to perform
coordinated observations following alerts from other monitoring
satellites. Therefore, no other proposals will be accepted for gamma-ray
bursts.


-------------------------------
5. Review Process and Schedule
-------------------------------
   Proposals may be submitted from May 18 through August 18. They will
be reviewed by a board of scientists in the fields of X-ray astrophysics
and other relevant fields. After adding ESA proposals, the selected
target list will be merged with the list selected in the US. The final
list will be announced in December 2004.
   Accepted targets are prioritized in three categories. Priority A
targets must be observed during the term. Priority B targets will be
observed during the term but could be carried over to the next term.
Priority C targets can be observed if there is a slot of observation
time, but will not be carried over to the following term if they are not
observed during the current term. The fraction of observation time is
A:B:C = 50% : 40% : 50% (40% more than the available time). Any TOO or
time critical target should be ranked A to be observed.

---------------
6. Data rights
---------------
   The data will be delivered to the successful proposer after standard
processing has been carried. The data will automatically go into the
public domain one year after the delivery of data to the proposer. The
data of Phase-Ia (100% SWG time) will be open to public at the end of
Phase-Ib. The data of generic TOO's and gamma-ray bursts observed in the
mission TOO time and SWG time will belong to the Astro-E2 team for one
year at least during Phase-Ia and Ib.


================================
PROPOSAL SUBMISSION GUIDELINES
================================

----------------
1. Observations
----------------
   X-ray observations with Astro-E2 observatory, from September 2005
through August 2006.

-------------------
2. Who may propose
-------------------
   Principal investigators (PI's) have to be affiliated with
institutions or universities located in Japan or countries other than US
or ESA member states. PI's in the US institutions and those in the ESA
member states should submit to NASA or ESA, respectively. PI's in other
countries should send proposals to Japan. When a graduate student is a
PI, his/her supervisor should be assigned as a Co-investigator.
Scientists, who stay in the US or in the ESA member states by a fund
from Japanese organizations, are able to submit to either ISAS or
NASA/ESA, but not to both.
   The requirement for the affiliation with above institutions does not
extend to Co-Investigators. In case of proposals from countries other
than Japan, US, and ESA member countries, collaboration with Japanese
colleagues is strongly encouraged. Proposals without Japanese co-I's can
be submitted, however, and some Japanese advisors will be introduced
after the acceptance.

-------------------------
3. Due date of proposals
-------------------------
   12:00 JUT (03:00 UT) on August 18, 2004. Printed material should be
postmarked no later than this date in Japan. In case of posting from
outside of Japan, express air mail should be used.

------------------------
4. Submission procedure
------------------------
   For each proposal, the following two items are BOTH necessary.

(1) RPS (Remote Proposal Submission system) submission: This is an
   on-line system, described in detail in
           http://www.astro.isas.jaxa.jp/astroe/
   The observation parameters in the electrical form must  be accurate
   because they will be directly tranferred on-line to the satellite
   operation system.

(2) 7 sets of hard copy of the proposal, which should be sent to the
   following address:
        Prof. Hideyo Kunieda
        Institute of Space and Astronautical Science
        Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency
        3-1-1, Yoshinodai, Sagamihara
        Kanagawa, 229-8510, Japan

-------------------
5. Proposal format
--------------------
   The proposal form consists of
(1) Cover Page (1 page),
(2) Target Form (1 page),
(3) Scientific Justification (scientific problem and technical
    feasibility) (maximum 4 pages; includes text, figures, charts,
    and tables)

-----------------------------
6. Supplemental Information
-----------------------------
For details, see the mission description available at
     http://www.astro.isas.jaxa.jp/astroe/
Questions may be addressed to either Prof. Kunieda at
kunieda@astro.isas.jaxa.jp, or to K. Makishima.
