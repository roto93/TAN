Title:   Structure, Evolution and Stability of the Gas-dust Disk in Galactic 
         Central Regions

Speaker:  Prof. Chi Yuan (IAA, Academia Sinica)

Date:     5 March 2004 (Friday)

Time:    12:10

Place:   Room 620,  Physics Building, NTHU

Abstract:
Gas-dust disks are found in the central regions in almost all nearby 
galaxies. It is believed that they supply the necessary material to fuel 
the spectacular phenomena of AGNs and starburst activities. In this 
talk, we will present evidences to support this idea. We think the 
presence of a bar, either major or nuclear, can effectively drive the 
matter in the disk to the galactic nucleus and starburst regions to 
energize the activities through a resonance excitation mechanism. We 
will show, by using wavelet methods, that most of central gas-dust disks 
in the nearby galaxies indeed have bar-driven signatures predicted by 
the theory. Furthermore, we use numerical simulations to show how the 
gas disks evolve as a result of bar-driving. In particular, we 
demonstrate the development of gravitational instability as gas 
accumulates to form a dense ring, which, we believe, is the origin of 
observed starburst rings. In some galaxies, a central disk of extremely 
high density  is formed and yet they are extremely stable in Toomre's 
sense. This is possibly the origin of molecular disks commonly observed 
in the nearby galaxies.

Subject: [Colloquium] ASIAA Colloquium this week - Dr. Steve Torchinsky

 
 Dear all,
 
	This week's colloquium will be presented by Dr. Steve Torchinsky.
 Dr. Torchinsky has worked at several observatories on millimeter and 
 submillimeter instruments and is currently at the Arecibo Observatory.
 On Friday (03/05), he will give us an overview of Arecibo and introduce 
 the new ALFA system with its astronomy projects.

	More information about the ASIAA colloquia can be found below at

Second Circular

The 2004 Annual Meeting of the Chinese Astronomical Society (Taiwan)

Taipei Astronomical Museum, April 24-25 (Saturday and Sunday), 2004
-------------------------------------------------------------

The 2004 Annual Meeting of the Chinese Astronomical Society (Taiwan)
will be held at Taipei Astronomical Museum on April 24-25, 2004. 
Papers in all fields of astronomy and astrophysics are solicited.
This is the annual meeting for astronomers and astrophysicists in Taiwan
to report their research and to exchange their ideas.
 
In scientific sessions, Prof. James Binney (Fellow of Merton College, 
Oxford University), Prof. Rolf Kudritzki (Director, Institute of 
Astronomy, University of Hawaii) and Prof. Sun Kwok (Director, Institute
of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Academia Sinica) will give three invited 
talks. Contributed papers will be organized as parallel sessions and 
poster presentation. In addition, there are discussion sessions on 
astronomy education in Taiwan and on future developments in Taiwan's 
astronomy. We are also pleased to announce that a public lecture will be 
delivered by Prof. Wei-Hsin Sun (Institute of Astronomy, National Central
University). Besides, a mini fair of books and telescopes is being arranged.

The Organizing Committee and the Scientific Program Committee sincerely 
invite you to participate all these activities. For further details and
more updated information of the Annual Meeting, please visit the society 
web site at <http://www.cast.org.tw/>.
