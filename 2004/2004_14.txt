Title :   How to Raise a Hairy Baby Black Hole

Speaker:  Dr. Mike Cai (IAA, Academia Sinica)

Date:     27 February 2004 (Friday)

Time:    12:10

Place:   Room 620,  Physics Building, NTHU
         
Abstract:         
We present here the first calculation of a spherical self-similar collapse
that leads to a black hole formation.  The dynamic evolution is triggered by
the central portion of a singular isothermal sphere in equilibrium
collapsing to for an infinitesimal black hole.  This perturbation removes
the pressure support for the layer immediately above, which causes it to
collapse, and so on.  The influence of gravitational collapse propagates out
as an expansion wave moving at the speed of sound.  Outside of the expansion
wave, matter remains in local equilibrium.  We have also examined the
effects of a weak and uniform magnetic field on the collapse.  Within the
assumptions of perfect magnetohydrodynamics, the magnetic field lines are
frozen to the collapsing matter, and arrange themselves in the form of a
split magnetic monopole on the large scale.  We believe this theoretical
model can serve to describe monolithic formation of massive black holes, and
the presence of magnetic fields helps to break self-similarity and to define
the final black hole mass.

Subject: postdoctoral position astrochemistry

A postdoctoral position in experimental physical chemistry (reaction 
dynamics, low temperature kinetics on ice surfaces, reactive scattering) 
is open at the Department of Chemistry, University of Hawai'i at Manoa, 
for the period of one year, renewable upon mutual agreement. Successful 
applicants should have a significant background in experimental reaction 
dynamics, molecular beams, vacuum technology, and laser systems. The 
prime directive of the experimental research program is to investigate 
the dynamics of bimolecular gas phase reactions and of reactions on 
surfaces to form complex molecules in extraterrestrial environments. A 
description of the current research group and projects can be found at 
http://www.chem.hawaii.edu/Bil301/welcome.html ; recent examples of our 
work are published in , for example, Chemical Reviews (102, 1309-1358, 
2002) and Int. Rev. Physical Chemistry (21, 307-356, 2002). To apply, 
please send a letter of interest, three letters of recommendation, CV, 
and publication list to Prof. Ralf I. Kaiser, Department of Chemistry, 
University of Hawai'i at Manoa, Honolulu, HI 96822-2275, USA, or via 
email to kaiser@gold.chem.hawaii.edu . Review of applications will start 
March 1, 2004, and continues until the position is filled.

Subject: [Colloquium] ASIAA Colloquium TODAY - Dr. Xingwu Zheng

 
 Dear all,
  
  	Just to remind you that today's colloquium (02/20 Fri) will be 
 given by our guest Dr. Xingwu Zheng from Nanjing University. After his
 introduction to the VLBI network in China at our lunch talk earlier this 
 week, Dr. Zheng will discuss today about his work on masers near massive 
 star forming regions.

	More information about ASIAA colloquia can be found below at our
 web url, "http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/act/colloquium.php"
  
 Regards,
      
 sheng-yuan
