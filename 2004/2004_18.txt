              Title : Numerical Simulations For A Gaseous Disk 
                      Driven By A Bar

              Abstract:

              The high resolution observation make people be able to probe
              the structures of galactic centeral region today. 
              A gaseous disk is found in the center region in almost all 
              normal galaxies.

              We would like to study a gaseous disk driven by a bar, 
              which consists of stars. Our approach is using numerical 
              methods. We develop the gas dynamical codes based on Godunov 
              methods and speed up the calculation of self-gravitation
              by fast Fourier method. Those numerical results
              are consistent with one derived by the spiral density wave 
              theory.
              
              In this talk, I will give an introduction of the spiral 
              density wave theory, numerical simulations for Milky Way,
              the numerical method for gas dynamical codes and discuss 
              some problems in numerical simulations.

Subject: [Colloquium] ASIAA Colloquium this week - Dr. Christian Veillet


 Dear all,
  
	This week, Dr. Christian Veillet, Director of the Canada-France-Hawaii
 Telescope, will be visiting ASIAA. Besides discussing with us about future
 collaborations, Dr. Veillet will give us two colloquium talks about the CFHT
 and its scientific achievements. The first talk of a CFHT overview is
 scheduled on Wednesday (02/25) afternoon (2:30pm). On Friday (02/27) morning,
 the second talk will be focused on the science programs of the Kuiper 
 Belt Objects at the CFHT.

	If you are interested in chatting with Dr. Veillet during his visit,
 please contact Shiang-Yu (sywang@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw) in advance. Please 
 also notice the special time for these two talks; the regular colloquium
 this Friday is re-scheduled to the morning due to the fire-and-emergency
 drill in the afternoon. More information about the ASIAA colloquia can be
 found below at our web url,"http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/act/colloquium.php".
  
 Regards,
      
 sheng-yuan
