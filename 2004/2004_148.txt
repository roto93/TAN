Subject: [Colloquium] ASIAA Special Lunch Talk (11/18 Thursday) 


  Dear all,

 	As Chi announced earlier, this Thursday (11/18) we will
  have a distinguished visitor, Prof. Jocelyn Bell Burnell, who
  discovered pulsars in 1967. During her brief visit to the institute,
  she will kindly offer us a special lunch talk titled "Pulsars
  and Extreme Physics". In this talk, Prof. Jocelyn Bell Burnell
  will give a general overview of our understanding about pulsars,
  including some recent developments. She will also discuss what
  pulsar physics has revealed about relativity.

 	Please notice the special time and location of the talk,
  and see the bottom of this message for lunch box ordering.

 	Mark your calendar and be sure to join!

  best,

  sheng-yuan
