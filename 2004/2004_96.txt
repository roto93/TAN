Subject: The 10th Star and Telescope Workshop 

Dear colleagues, 

The next Star and Telescope Workshop, the 10th in its series, will be held
on June 11, Friday, at NCU.  We will concentrate on the technical issues
this time, e.g., the system calibration and data analysis pipelines, with
ample time for discussion. 

As usual, it will start at 11 am and end around 4 pm.  In addition to
invited talks, which expect to prompt exchange of experience and
difficulties in the LOT performance and data analysis, a few contributed
talks can be entertained.  If you are interested in joining the Workshop, 
but not in the partcipant mailing list, please send inquiries to 

  wchen@astro.ncu.edu.tw

Regards, 

Wen Ping Chen

Postdoctoral Positions in Theoretical/Computational Astrophysics
Theoretical Institute for Advanced Research in Astrophysics
Academia Sinica and National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan

The newly established Theoretical Institute for Advanced Research in
Astrophysics (TIARA) is seeking applications to fill several postdoctoral
positions in theoretical/computational astrophysics in Fall 2004.  
TIARAis a joint collaboration between the National Tsing Hua University based
in Hsinchu and Academia Sinica based in Taipei and has a mission to carry
out research at the highest level and to establish a vigorous visitors
program in theoretical astrophysics.  Present research at TIARA include
investigations in the areas of Galactic Dynamics, Star and Pla
Formation, High Energy/Relativistic Astrophysics and Computnal
Fluid Dynamics and Magnetohydrodynamics.  The successful cndidates will
also have the opportunity for collaborations with scientists in the
ongoing observational programs (SMA, AMiBA, TAOS projects within the
Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics
(http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw).

We will consider applications in all areas of theoretical astrophysics 
and are particularly interested in applicants in the field of star 
formation.  Applicants should submit a curriculum vita, a brief summary of 
research and future research plans, and arrange for three letters of 
recommendation to be sent to Ms. Winny Hsieh, Chief 
Administrator, Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics, TIARA 
Postdoctoral Positions, Academia Sinica, P.O. Box 
23-141, Taipei 106, Taiwan; Email: asiaa@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw.

The closing date for applications is July 1, 2004.
