Dear sirs/madames:
    We have been working on some orbits of past comets and we need =
confirmation on one of them for our research paper.  We wonder if you =
might be able to help us?
    There is a book written by Chinese astronomers of the past sitings =
of a number of comets but I am told that the book is out of print.  =
Perhaps you may have the book or know of someone who has one?  The book =
is A Comprehensive Collection of Ancient Chinese Astronomical Records =
(Zhongguo gudai tianziang jilu zongji), published in Nanjing in 1988.   =
The book was written by Mrs. Jiang and Mr. Xu, a husband and wife team.  =
  I sure hope that you can help us. =20
    Perhaps you might know how I can get in touch with them, because =
surely they have a copy of their own book.=20
    I would like to know if there is any record in that book or in any =
other book on the history of comets of any being seen at these =
particular times in the past :  933/March, 397/Jul, 140BC/Feb/, =
675BC/Sept., 1211BC/May, 1746BC/Dec, 2282BC/Aug, or 2818BC but with a =
perihelion of about 0.85 AU?
     It was seen in 1468 at a perihelion of 0.85.  Here is a list of =
some comets and their orbits that we just worked out lately.  It is from =
a spreadsheet program.
     We sure hope that you can help us, please?

Extreme Ultraviolet Emission in Clusters of Galaxies

Abstract

Clusters of galaxies are among the largest scale structures
in the Universe. The general characteristics of these objects 
will be reviewed. Observations with EUVE, ROSAT, and BeppoSAX 
have shown that some clusters of galaxies produce intense EUV 
emission. These observations have produced considerable interest; 
over 100 papers have been published on this topic in the refereed 
literature.

The more notable suggestions as to the source
of this radiation include a "warm" (10^6 K) intracluster medium which, 
if present, would constitute the major baryonic component of the 
universe, and inverse Compton scattering of cosmic microwave background 
photons against low energy cosmic rays. The source of these particles 
has been suggested to be an old (~Giga year) population of cluster 
cosmic rays; particles associated with relativistic jets in the cluster; 
and cascading particles produced by shocks from sub-cluster merging. 

The observational situation is equally uncertain with many reports of 
detections which have been subsequently contradicted by analyses carried 
out by other groups. Evidence supporting a thermal and a non-thermal 
origin have been reported. The existing EUV, FUV, and optical data are 
reviewed and clarified. A new source mechanism has just been proposed 
that satisfies all aspects of the observations. This model will be 
discussed in the context of the data.

 is star formation. He will talk about his recent work using
 the CHAMP bolometer installed on CSO in Mauna Kea.

        More information about IAA colloquium talks can be found at the
  following web url, "http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/act/colloquium.php"


 Regards,

 Trung
