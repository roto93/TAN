Dear Professors Yuan, Ryu, and Jing,
cc: K. Wada

I am writing this message on East Asia Numerical Astrophysics
Meeting from November 30.  We are now collecting papers through
our web site until the end of this month.

This meeting was planned as a rather practical regional meeting.
Therefore, although we will accept participants from distant
countries, the first target is east Asian countries.  From our
observatory, I got a small travel grant to support this meeting.
The amount is expected to be at least 300,000Yen=3,000USD per
one country for each China, Korea, and Taiwan.  Expenses for
living 4 days in the observatory and domestic travel (airport to
the observatory) would be 400-500USD. So, airfare of some
participants could be covered.  For example, a combination of
an airfare for one person and local expenses for a couple of
persons is possible.  I think this travel support should be used
for young postdocs or graduate students.  Would you please
consider who should be supported in your country?  And encourage
them to apply for the presentation to this meeting. Since the
application is still open, please do not consider the amount
of money as definitive.  Thank you in advance,
Regards,

Kohji Tomisaka
