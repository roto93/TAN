Subject: CAST 2004; deadline extended

Dear Colleagues,
due to some networking irregularities, which may have hindered
some of you from submitting your abstract on-line, the Executive
Council of CAST has decided to extend the registration and abstract
submission deadline to the 10th April, which is definitely a 
strict one.
Please visit the CAST web site (<http://www.cast.org.tw>, English version
available) for more details.
In case you still encounter problems when accessing the CAST web pages,
email registration and submission is acceptable. 
If you pick this option, please edit the templates attached below and 
send it back to <m929094@fermi.phy.ncu.edu.tw> by 4/10.
Thanks for your time and looking forward to seeing you in the 
CAST 2004 Annual Meeting on 4/24-25.
Regards,
--
