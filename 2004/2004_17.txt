Subject: [Colloquium] ASIAA Colloquium this week - Dr. Christian Veillet


 Dear all,
  
	This week, Dr. Christian Veillet, Director of the Canada-France-Hawaii
 Telescope, will be visiting ASIAA. Besides discussing with us about future
 collaborations, Dr. Veillet will give us two colloquium talks about the CFHT
 and its scientific achievements. The first talk of a CFHT overview is
 scheduled on Wednesday (02/25) afternoon (2:30pm). On Friday (02/27) morning,
 the second talk will be focused on the science programs of the Kuiper 
 Belt Objects at the CFHT.

	If you are interested in chatting with Dr. Veillet during his visit,
 please contact Shiang-Yu (sywang@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw) in advance. Please 
 also notice the special time for these two talks; the regular colloquium
 this Friday is re-scheduled to the morning due to the fire-and-emergency
 drill in the afternoon. More information about the ASIAA colloquia can be
 found below at our web url,"http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/act/colloquium.php".
  
 Regards,
