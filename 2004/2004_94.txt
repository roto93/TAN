Subject: The 10th Star and Telescope Workshop 

Dear colleagues, 

The next Star and Telescope Workshop, the 10th in its series, will be held
on June 11, Friday, at NCU.  We will concentrate on the technical issues
this time, e.g., the system calibration and data analysis pipelines, with
ample time for discussion. 

As usual, it will start at 11 am and end around 4 pm.  In addition to
invited talks, which expect to prompt exchange of experience and
difficulties in the LOT performance and data analysis, a few contributed
talks can be entertained.  If you are interested in joining the Workshop, 
but not in the partcipant mailing list, please send inquiries to 

  wchen@astro.ncu.edu.tw

Regards, 

Wen Ping Chen
