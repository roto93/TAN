TITLE: Formation of Sun-like Stars - Millimeter and Submillimeter 
       Observations

SPEAKER: Dr Naomi HIRANO (Institute of Astronomy & Astrophysics, AS)

Abstract
========
Low-mass stars like our Sun are known to be formed deep within
the  molecular cloud cores with ~0.1 pc size and high density of 10^4 - 
10^5 cm^-3. Since molecular cloud cores are totally opaque to the visible
light, observations using the wavebands longer than infrared are essential
to study how stars are formed. In this talk, I will present the recent
mm and submm observational results on the nearby star forming regions,
and refer to several interesting topics including infalling protostelalr
envelopes, circumstellar disks, and energetic jets blown out from the 
newly born stars. The recent results of the Submillimeter Array (SMA)
will be also presented.
