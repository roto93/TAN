Dear all the colleagues:

    Our 13th Asia Pacific Winter School/Workshop will begin this Friday 
(Jan 13, 2012) and will end on the Firday a week later (Jan 20). In 
between, Jan 14 is the holiday for the presidential election. The lunar 
new year (Jan 23) was sort of cutting in abrupt, making the schedule a 
little hectic.

    However, we managed to line up the lecturers/speakers, which include 
Bob McKeown (Caltech /Jefferson Lab), Xiangdong Ji (Maryland/SJTU), 
Bo-Qiang Ma (Peking), J. Yokoyama (U. Tokyo), Sang Pyo Kim (Kunsan U), and 
others, even if the time was rather short. You and your students are so 
much welcome to this event. If you are interested in giving a talk (to 
enhance the interactions), please contact, at the meeting, Sang Pyo Kim or 
Bo-Qiang Ma for further arrangements. 

    So, again, to see you this Friday. Best wishes, W-Y. Pauchy Hwang
