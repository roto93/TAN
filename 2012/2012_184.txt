Dear Colleagues,

You are cordially invited to attend the Joint Colloquium
which will be held on October 16 (next Tuesday).
The Joint Colloquium Series is organized by
the NTU Physics Department, Center for Condensed Matter Science (CCMS),
Leung Center for Cosmology and Particle Astrophysics (LeCosPA),
Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA),
and the Institute of Atomic and Molecular Sciences (IAMS).
The idea is to have excellent speakers to give inspiring, informative,
but non-technical talks on the frontiers of Sciences.

Enclosed below is the information of the Joint Colloquium on October 16.

Best regards,

Pisin Chen (LeCosPA)
Ting-Wai Chiu (NTU-Phys)
Michitoshi Hayashi (CCMS)
Lain-Jong Li (IAMS)
Michihiro Takami (ASIAA)

ASIAA/CCMS/IAMS/LeCosPA/NTU-Physics Joint Colloquium
Speaker: Prof. Chi-Kuang Sun(Director of Molecular Imaging Center  
National Taiwan University)
                (孫啟光 教授)
Topic: Molecular Imaging – Research at the Molecular Imaging Center of  
National Taiwan University
Time: 10/16 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:10
Place: Room 104, CCMS-New Physics Building


Abstract :
    Molecular imaging is broadly defined as the characterization and  
measurement of biological processes in living animals, model systems,  
and humans at the cellular and molecular levels using remote imaging  
detection methods. Molecular imaging research is to develop novel  
imaging technologies for interrogating molecular events in living  
objects, to understand molecular phenomena in diseases such as cancer,  
cardiovascular diseases, and neurology diseases, and to accelerate new  
discoveries in biology and medicine. In this talk, we will discuss the  
current research activities in the Molecular Imaging Center of  
National Taiwan University. The goals of the Center programs are to  
integrate the multidisciplinary resources of National Taiwan  
University to fundamentally change how biological research is  
performed from the molecular point of view with cells in their intact  
environment in living subjects, to develop personalized ways to  
diagnose diseases and monitor therapies in patients with higher  
sensitivity and specificity, to reduce mortality and to improve life  
quality, and to reduce unnecessary diagnoses and therapies. Research  
in this area will leverage both the nation’s bio-technology research  
and the biomedical imaging industry, providing a training ground for  
experts in medical imaging hardware utilization.


Brief Bio. :
    Chi-Kuang Sun is currently the Chief Director of Molecular Imaging  
Center of National Taiwan University, conducting research on Photonic  
Molecular Imaging, THz Molecular Imaging, and Molecular Ultrasonic  
Imaging. He received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from  
National Taiwan University, Taipei, in 1987 and the M.S. and Ph.D.  
degrees in applied physics from Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, in  
1990 and 1995, respectively. He was with the NSF Center of Quantized  
Electronics Structures (QUEST), University of California, Santa  
Barbara, CA, from 1995 to 1996 as an assistant research engineer,  
conducting research on quantum dots, GaN, microcavity, high speed  
communication devices and systems. In 1996, he joined the Graduate  
Institute of Photonics and Optoelectronics and Department of  
Electrical Engineering at National Taiwan University (NTU), Taipei,  
Taiwan, where he is now a life distinguished professor. He is an  
adjunct research fellow at the Institute of Physics and Research  
Center for Applied Sciences, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan since  
2010 and 2006, respectively.
    Dr. Sun is a fellow of the Optical Society of America, a fellow of  
the International Society for Optical Engineering (SPIE), and a fellow  
of the IEEE Photonics Society. He was the recipient of year 2000 C.N.  
Yang Outstanding Young Researcher Award from Association of Asian  
Pacific Physical Society, the 2001 Academia Sinica Research Award for  
Junior Researchers, the 2003 Leica Microsystems Innovation Award, the  
MERIT Award from the National Health Research Institute of Taiwan  
(2003-2009; 2010), the 2004 NTU Research Achievement Award, the  
Outstanding Research Award (2004-2006; 2009-2012) and the Outstanding  
Research Grant Award (2008) from National Science Council of Taiwan,  
the 2008 Y. Z. Hsu Scientific Paper Award, and the 2010 Engineering  
Medal from the Taiwan Photonic Society.

Topic:        How do galaxies become red? - An HOD model of the dependence of SDSS DR7 galaxies on their multiscale environment
Time:        10/19 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
Following the new approach of Wilman et al 2010 (MNRAS, 406, 1701) we model the dependence of red and blue central and satellite galaxies on their multiscale environment. We fit an HOD model to the multiscale measurements of a sample of ~113000 galaxies from the SDSS DR7, in order to understand the influence of the environment on the transition of blue galaxies to the red sequence. We find that a model in which the red satellite fraction grows slowly with halo mass fits the data best, pointing towards a scenario in which galaxies can already become red in small mass haloes just before they are accreted onto larger mass haloes. We plan to extend the analysis to higher redshifts using VIPERS data, in order to investigate the evolution of the red satellite and central fraction since z=1.
