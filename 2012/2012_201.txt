            East-Asian sub-mm VLBI workshop

          *** From East-Asia to super-massive black holes ***

        Date : 10/Dec/2012 (full day meeting)
        Venue: Lecture room at NAOJ Mitaka

        http://www.miz.nao.ac.jp/submilli/node/42

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Aim of the workshop:

  Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), an international collaboration to
  build the unique world array of sub-mm VLBI, has been pioneering
  study of super-massive black holes with ultra-high resolution.
  In order to summarize the related activities in East Asia and to
  promote effective collaborations toward their ultimate project
  goals, we would like to hold a one-day workshop, where researchers
  working on mm/sub-mm VLBI and/or black hole science in EA region
  gather, exchange information and thoughts, and discuss the future
  directions.


Planned speakers and meeting program:

  Kazunori Akiyama    (NAOJ, Japan)
  Keiichi Asada    (ASIAA, Taiwan)
  Shep Doeleman    (MIT Haystack, USA)
  Sang-Sung Lee    (KASI, Korea)
  Zhi-Qiang Shen     (SHAO, China)

  There will be also slots for contributed talks, and both scientific
  and technical papers are welcome. However, since the workshop is
  only for one day, note that we may not be able to allocate all the
  contributed talks if there are too many applications.

Registration:

  If you are interested in attending this workshop, please return the
  following form to

    akiyo.komori"AT"nao.ac.jp  (change "AT" to @)

  no later than

    *** 12 Nov 2012 ***.

Dear Colleagues:

    The Hurricane Sandy (in the East Coast of U.S.) starts taking the 
toll on us (Taiwan). So, the first lecture of Tung-Mow Yan will now be on 
November 8 (Thursday), 4:30 PM. Try to re-mark your calendar and help to 
tell the interested students. Sincerely yours, Pauchy

Dear Colleagues,

You are cordially invited to attend the Joint Colloquium
which will be held on November 06.
The Joint Colloquium Series is organized by
the NTU Physics Department, Center for Condensed Matter Science (CCMS),
Leung Center for Cosmology and Particle Astrophysics (LeCosPA),
Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA),
and the Institute of Atomic and Molecular Sciences (IAMS).
The idea is to have excellent speakers to give inspiring, informative,
but non-technical talks on the frontiers of Sciences.

Enclosed below is the information of the Joint Colloquium on November 06.

Best regards,

Pisin Chen (LeCosPA)
Ting-Wai Chiu (NTU-Phys)
Michitoshi Hayashi (CCMS)
Lain-Jong Li (IAMS)
Michihiro Takami (ASIAA)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ASIAA/CCMS/IAMS/LeCosPA/NTU-Physics Joint Colloquium
Speaker: Prof. Jean Turner(University of California, Los Angeles, USA)
Topic: Molecular Gas and Star Formation in Galaxies
Time: 11/06 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:10
Place: Room 104, CCMS-New Physics Building

Brief Bio. :
    Professor Turner is an extragalactic astrophysicist. She received  
her A.B. and Ph.D. degrees at Harvard University and UC Berkeley.  
Before joining UCLA as professor, she worked at the  
Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, and has been a Visiting  
Scientist at Caltech, Space Telescope, and the Joint ALMA Observatory.  
She has contributed to the development and commissioning of two  
millimeter and submillimeter telescopes. She is a fellow of the  
American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Abstract :
    The development of millimeter-wave array telescopes has made it  
possible to study gas and star formation in galaxies beyond the Milky  
Way. Dense gas is the fuel for star formation, and it can be mapped  
via its emission lines of molecules such as carbon monoxide. The  
dynamics, excitation and chemistry of the gas can be studied in a  
range of galactic environments, including galactic nuclei and  
starbursts. What facilitates and regulates star formation in galaxies?  
How does star formation shape galactic structure? I discuss recent  
results from the Submillimeter Array, and the potential for future  
discoveries with the Atacama Large Millimeter-Submillimeter Array  
(ALMA).

Dear colleagues

As many of you know, we produce a calendar every year and now we are making
it for 2013.
While it collects images mostly taken with our facilities, the calendar is
widely used by astronomers
ourside NCU.  To make it even more informative and useful than is, I am
asking you to send me
dates of conferences that you will be organizing or know of which will take
place on the island,
or deadlines of observing proposals---whatever you think would be
potentially useful to other
fellow astronomers---and we will try to print them on the calendar for
circulation.

Please do it before Friday.  We are about to send it to print.

wchen@astro.ncu.edu.tw

Cheers,

Wen Ping

[Hi WP, the 2013 ASROC General Assembly (ASROC2013) will be held on May 24-26 at
National Penghu University of Science and Technology in Magong, Penghu Islands.
