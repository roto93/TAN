Arizona Radio Observatory: Call for Proposals (Fall 2012) 
------------------------------------------------------------ 
Dear Astronomers in Taiwan, 

Proposals are being solicited, from members of the University Consortium of 
ALMA-Taiwan and ASIAA, for observing time for the period October 1, 2012 - 
February 1, 2013, at the Arizona Radio Observatory, for the Sub-Millimeter 
Telescope (SMT) and the Kitt Peak 12 Meter (KP12M). The proposal deadline of 
UCAT/ASIAA for this 2012 fall semester is set on September 19, 2012 (Wednesday). 

The SMT currently supports a dual-polarization, 1 mm receiver with ALMA Band-6 
sideband-separating mixers, a dual-polarization 0.8 mm receiver, and a 0.4 mm 
(602-720 GHz) dual-polarization receiver with ALMA Band-9 mixers. The SMT 
control system has been updated to allow for dual polarization, dual sideband 
observations (so-called "4 IF mode"). The KP12M supports a dual-polarization 
3 mm receivers (82-116 GHz) that employs ALMA Band-3 sideboard-separating 
mixers, as well as dual polarization, single sideband receivers for the lower 
part of the 3 mm window (65-86 GHz) and at 2 mm (130-180 GHz). Remote observing 
is available at both ARO telescopes. Please refer to http://aro.as.arizona.edu/ 
for more details. 

Information about Remote Observing can be viewed at: 
http://aro.as.arizona.edu/remote/remote.htm . 
For further information about remote observing and other operational questions, 
please contact Tom Folkers, Operations Manager: tfolkers@email.arizona.edu 

Proposals should consist of: 
1. A proposal Cover Sheet, obtainable at http://aro.as.arizona.edu/proposals. 
2. A brief scientific and technical justification (no more than 2 pages). 
3. A source list with observing time requirements and justification, and/or 
  tables, figures and references (no more than 1 page in total). 
4. provide the IP number of the computer you will be using during your observing 
  time. 

Please pay special attention to the "Sun avoidance" issue of your proposed 
observations. The SMT will not be pointed to within 42 degrees of the Sun, and 
the KP12M, 15 degrees. 

Electronic submissions will be accepted in PDF format only. Scheduling of 
successful proposals will be done according to availability of the receivers 
requested. Please submit your proposals by midnight (23:59 pm CST) September 19, 
2012 to: kuan AT asiaa.sinica.edu.tw . 

Kind regards, 
Yi-Jehng Kuan 
on behalf of UCAT's ARO TAC
