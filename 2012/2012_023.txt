  *** Training Course on NCUcam-1 Operation and Data Reduction ***

This is an announcement for the training course on NCUcam-1 operation
and data reduction. NCUcam-1 is a new CCD imager that Institute of
Astronomy at National Central University has developed. NCUcam-1 is
equipeed with a thick fully depleted CCD and offers a superb
sensitivity at longer wavelength. It is now open for the astronomical
community in Taiwan as one of open-use instruments for Lulin One-meter
Telescope. The main purpose of the training course arranged this time
is to provide an opportunity for potential users actually to operate
the imager and obtain some data to deal with. For those who is
planning an observation using NCUcam-1 is highly encouraged to join
this program.

The training course consists of 3 parts: (1) 2-hr lecture at NCU main
campus, (2) training observation at Lulin Observatory, and (3)
hands-on lecture on data reduction at Tongpu. Participants are
expected to join all the 3 parts of this program.

Schedule:

  20/Feb/2012:    deadline of application submission
  25/Feb/2012:    announcement of participants selection
  02/Mar/2012:    2-hr lecture at NCU
  10-12/Mar/2012: 2-night observation at Lulin
  12-13/Mar/2012: hands-on lecture on data reduction

The lecture at NCU provides the basic concept and design of
NCUcam-1. After the lecture, participants form a group and start to
plan the observation. The observing time of Lulin One-meter Telescope
on 10 and 11 March 2012 is secured for this program. Participants
carry out the observations of photometric standard stars and a few
targets of their research topics. Calibration frames are obtained as
well. After the observation, participants will reduced the data at the
hands-on lecture. Basic CCD data reduction, astrometric calibration,
and simple aperture photometry are planned for this hands-on lecture.

For more information on NCUcam-1, please check following presentation
slide which was used for the Annual Meeting of Physics Society of
Taiwan in January 2012.

Brief description of your research topic:




Urgency of using NCUcam-1 for your research:




----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note:

- Due to the limited lodging space at Lulin Observatory, the number
  of participants is limited to 10 at the maximum.
- Participants need to find the financial support by themselves for
  their transportation, accommodation and other expenses for this
  program.
- Participants need to arrange their own transportation to/from Lulin
  Observatory. Participants also need to arrange their own
  accommodation at Tongpu for joining the hands-on lecture.
- Participants are expected to bring their own laptop computer with
  IRAF/SAOimage DS9/WCSTools/Source extractor installed.
- For the inquiry on the NCUcam-1 training course, please send a
  message to <ncucam1@s3b.astro.ncu.edu.tw>.
