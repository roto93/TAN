            Astronomical Society of the Republic of China 
                2012 Scientific Assembly (ASROC2012) 

          National Taitung University (Taitung Campus), Taitung 
                           May 25 - 27, 2012 

The Astronomical Society cordially invites you to participate in the 2012 
Scientific Assembly of the Astronomical Society of the Republic of China 
(ASROC2012) to be held at National Taitung University on May 25 - 27, 2012. 
This is the annual event for all astronomers and astrophysicists in Taiwan 
to demonstrate their most recent discoveries and observations, to report 
their latest research results and to exchange ideas as well as to organize 
collaborations. 

In this year's meeting, there will be the general assembly meeting, two 
plenary talks, scientific and educational sessions, as well as poster 
presentation. The plenary talks feature Dr. Michael Mumma, Director of the 
Goddard Center for Astrobiology at NASA Astrobiology Institute, on "Comet 
Taxonomy and Astrobiology", and Dr. Jesus Galindo Trejo, a senior research 
fellow at the Institute of Aesthetic Research at National Autonomous 
University of Mexico, on "Mayan Astronomy and 2012 Doomsday -- the Prophecy 
of Maya". All contributions in the meeting, including oral talks and poster 
presentations, will be published in the Journal of Taipei Astronomical 
Museum. Best poster awards will also be granted. 

In addition to the scientific agenda, the meeting will organize a group 
tour in the afternoon of May 26 (Sat). A conference banquet and a sky gazing 
event will later be held in the same evening. During the meeting, book and 
instrumentation exhibition are also expected. 

The ASROC2012 website is online from 2012 February 24; a tentative schedule 
of the meeting and the registration information will be available. Given 
the remote location of the meeting, the organizing committee will help 
making group reservations for the round-trip train tickets between Taipei 
and Taitung. For those who would like to enjoy our service, please do 
complete the registration before the early registration deadline (March 23). 
People who register after 2012 March 23 will need to make their own travel 
arrangements. Participants with contributions should submit their abstracts 
online by April 27. A registration fee of NTD500 should be paid on site. 
(Registration fee will be waived for ASROC members with 2012 annual 
membership fee paid.) Banquet charge of NTD50 per person shall also be paid 
on site. 

For more details and updated information (such as the poster format, lodging, 
group tour, and journal format), please visit the ASROC website at

> Subject: [NRAO-Announcements] NRAO Director Appointment

Dear Colleagues, 

I am very pleased to announce that Anthony James (Tony) Beasley has been unanimously approved as the next Director of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) by the Board of Trustees of Associated Universities, Inc. (AUI). The National Science Foundation (NSF) has also approved this appointment, and Tony has accepted. He will start at NRAO on or about May 21, 2012. 

As many of you know, Tony has had a long history with NRAO. After receiving his Bachelor's in Physics in 1986 and his Doctorate in Astrophysics in 1991 from the University of Sydney, he joined NRAO as a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Very Long Baseline Array in 1991. He was appointed as a Deputy Assistant Director in 1997, and served as Assistant Director from 1998 to 2000. 

In 2000, Tony left NRAO to become Project Manager for the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy. In 2004, he returned to NRAO as an Assistant Director, but this time as the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Project Manager at the Joint ALMA Office in Chile. In 2008, Tony joined the National Ecological Observatory Network as Chief Operating Officer and Project Manager. 

Despite his brief sabbatical from radio astronomy, Tony has continued to serve on many high profile advisory and review committees, including some with the International Square Kilometre Array project. Tony is widely known and highly respected in the radio astronomy community and at NSF for his professional experience and accomplishments. He has played key roles in the implementation of some the world¡¦s most advanced and successful radio astronomy facilities. 

Tony returns to NRAO at an exciting and challenging time, succeeding Fred K.Y. Lo, who has served as Director since 2002. With ALMA and the Expanded Very Large Array both starting early science, joining the reinvigorated Green Bank Telescope and Very Long Baseline Array, Tony will build upon the numerous Observatory achievements led by Fred over the past decade. We certainly owe Fred an enormous amount of gratitude for these accomplishments. 

During the coming months, Tony and Fred will work closely with the NRAO management team to ensure a smooth transition, and I will personally do everything possible to help.  We all look forward to Tony rejoining the AUI/NRAO team, while we thank Fred for his accomplishments. 

Best regards, 

Ethan Schreier, President 
Associated Universities, Inc.

Dear all, below is the information for upcoming colloquium at IANCU:


Title: The Interaction of Evolved Stellar Wind with the Companions
Speaker: Dr. Hyosun Kim (ASIAA)
Date: 2012-03-02
Time: 14:00-15:00
Location: NCU, S4-1013
Abstract:

Recent observations of strikingly well-defined spirals around asymptotic giant branch
(AGB) stars point to the importance of the presence of binary companions to explain the
properties of the evolved giant envelopes. In a binary system, the structure of the mass
lost by an AGB star is altered (1) by modifying the distribution of the wind velocity
due to the reflex motion of the AGB star and (2) by gathering a fraction of the wind
material into the gravitational potential of the companion so as to create a
gravitational density wake. These two effects associated with a binary companion are
examined, and compared, using high resolution three-dimensional hydrodynamic
simulations. Attention is focused on the morphological and kinematic properties of the
circumstellar pattern as potential probes for the binary properties.

*** Special Seminar
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:	Dr. Chien-Hsiu Lee (NCU)
Topic:		PAndromeda - First results from the high-cadence monitoring of M31 with Pan-STARRS 1
Time:		2/29 (Wednesday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:		 R1203
Abstract:
The Pan-STARRS 1 (PS1) survey of M31 (PAndromeda) is designed to identify
gravitational microlensing events, caused by bulge and disk stars (selflensing) and by compact matter in the halos of M31 and the Milky Way (halo lensing, or lensing by MACHOs). With the 7 deg2 FOV of PS1, the entire disk of M31 can be imaged with one single pointing. Our aim is to monitor M31 with this wide FOV with daily sampling (20 mins/day). In the 2010 season we acquired in total 91 nights toward M31, with 90 nights in the rP1 and 66 nights in the iP1. The total integration time in rP1 and iP1 are 70740s and 36180s, respectively. As a preliminary analysis, we study a 40â² Ã 40â²sub-field in the central region of M31, a 20â² Ã 20â² sub-field in the disk of M31 and a 20â² Ã 20â² sub-field for the investigation of astrometric precision. We demonstrate that
the PSF is good enough to detect microlensing events. We present light curves for 6 candidate microlensing events. This is a competitive rate compared to previous M31 microlensing surveys. We finally also present one example light curve for Cepheids, novae and eclipsing binaries in these sub-fields.
