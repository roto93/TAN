Dear colleagues

As many of you know, we produce a calendar every year and now we are making
it for 2013.
While it collects images mostly taken with our facilities, the calendar is
widely used by astronomers
ourside NCU.  To make it even more informative and useful than is, I am
asking you to send me
dates of conferences that you will be organizing or know of which will take
place on the island,
or deadlines of observing proposals---whatever you think would be
potentially useful to other
fellow astronomers---and we will try to print them on the calendar for
circulation.

Please do it before Friday.  We are about to send it to print.

Cheers,

Wen Ping
