> Subject: HSC workshop on AGN/SMBH

Dear HSC lovers in Taiwan,


HSC (Hyper Suprime Cam) of Subaru telescope will be made available very soon, and I am happy to circulate information on the following HSC workshop on Super Massive Black Holes and AGNs to be held in this December in Japan to Taiwan colleagues. This is an international workshop for all partners (Princeton, Japan, and Taiwan), and your contribution is VERY MUCH WELCOME. I hope I (Youichi) can help you as a LOC member for Taiwan colleagues, and so feel free to ask me (as well as to Tohru, the SOC/LOC chair) your questions if any.


Regards,
Youichi Ohyama (ASIAA)


First Circular:
Workshop on SMBHs in the Universe: The Era of the HSC Surveys


==============================
18--20 December 2012
Ehime University, Matsuyama, Japan
http://astro.edu.nagasaki-u.ac.jp/HSC-AGN2012/
==============================



The formation and evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are
among the most exciting and challenging topics in astronomy and
astrophysics. New wide-field deep surveys are required to tackle
these issues, and Subaru's new wide-field camera (Hyper Suprime-Cam;
HSC) will bring promising opportunities to make breakthroughs in
this research field. Since the operation of HSC will start soon,
now it is a good time to have an intensive face-to-face discussion
among interested astronomers in the HSC collaboration (i.e., Japan,
Princeton, and Taiwan).


The main goals of this meeting are understanding the current status
of the HSC development and the strategy of the data analysis,
sharing scientific ideas on SMBH studies using the HSC data, and
promoting various collaborations on SMBH studies among the
researchers. We will focus on doing science and writing papers based
on the very early data of the coming HSC surveys. These discussions
in advance of the start of the HSC surveys will maximize the
scientific output in the theme of SMBH studies.


We will focus on the following topics, among others:
  -- Current status of the HSC hardware and software
  -- Survey plans and output photometric catalogs
  -- Quasar selection methods
  -- Statistics of quasars and SMBHs from the HSC data
  -- Co-evolution studies of SMBHs and galaxies with the HSC data
  -- Synergies of HSC and multi-wavelength data for SMBH studies
  -- Strategies for spectroscopic follow-up. Looking forward to PFS.
  -- Theoretical preparations for HSC quasar surveys
  -- Action items for the HSC surveys


This meeting will take place in Matsuyama, on Shikoku Island, about
a 2 hour flight from Tokyo. Matsuyama is famous for the Dogo-Onsen
hot spring, which is believed to be the oldest hot spring in Japan.
The details of the registration, abstract submission, travel info,
and so on will be announced in the second circular, which will be
distributed at the end of September.
If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us (see
below). We are looking forward to seeing you in Matsuyama!
