Dear colleagues,

The deadline for EANAM
5th (Kyoto, Oct. 29-Nov.2) is approaching.
I would appreciate it if you
could remind your colleagues of the
deadline, AUGUST 31st.

You can
find the web page for the registration at


http://www2.yukawa.kyoto-u.ac.jp/ws/2012/eanam5/ [1]

The deadline is
for hotel accomodation, finanicial support and visa
as well as for
contributed papers. Although LOC has hotel rooms
available at this
moment, they will be released in early September
if we have vacancy. We
will offer the rooms on a first-come-first
-served basis.

As you know,
we have much time for contributed talks. If you find
good works by
nearby young posdocs and stundets, please encourage them
to
apply.

Yours,
Tomoyuki
