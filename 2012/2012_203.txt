Hey Shiang-Yu, 

    Here is the announcement of the SITELLE workshop. Would you mind 
circulating it around the Taiwanese community? 

Thanks for your help, 

Daniel

Dear Colleagues, 

SITELLE, an imaging Fourier transform spectrometer, is currently being 
built in Quebec City. 
A collaboration between Universite Laval, ABB, Universite de Montreal 
and the CFHT, SITELLE has been accepted as a 
Guest Instrument by the Canada-France-Hawaii telescope, where it will 
be shipped, if all goes according to plans, 
in the summer of 2013. After the acceptance tests and the 
commissioning phase, SITELLE will then be available 
to the entire CFHT community. 

SITELLE is an integral field spectrometer, with a field of view of 11 
x 11 arcminutes (0.3'' pixels), and will be capable of 
obtaining spatially resolved spectra (R ~ 1 - 10e4) of extended 
sources in selected bands of the visible (350 - 850 nm). 

We are organizing a 3-day workshop in Quebec on May 12 - 14, 2013 to 
present the instrument and its capabilities, 
chose the selected bandpasses (and therefore the filters) that are 
optimized for the needs of the community, 
as well as to discuss observing strategies and eventually start 
collaborations in order to maximize the 
scientific return of SITELLE in the years to come. This workshop will 
include formal presentations about the 
instrument and its capabilities as well "core" science projects, but 
ample time will be allocated for discussions. 
A visit to the ABB lab, where SITELLE is built, is also planned. At 
the time of the workshop, SITELLE should be 
undergoing a series of tests. 

The workshop will be held at "Hotel-Musee des Premieres Nations", in 
Wendake, near Quebec City: 
http://www.hotelpremieresnations.ca/index.php?langue=en& (english) 
http://www.hotelpremieresnations.ca/index.php?langue=fr& (francais) 

A web page should be available soon, with informations about the 
workshop and registration, and SITELLE itself. 

In the meantime, please mark these dates (12 - 14 May 2013) on your 
calendar and contact me (ldrissen@phy.ulaval.ca) to 
express your interest in this workshop.
