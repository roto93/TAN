Dear Yi-Jehng,

Would you please send this message to TAN?

Thank you,

-------- Original Message --------

Dear all,

Some of you may notice from the IAA/TIARA homepage that we will have
TIARA Workshop on

  "Star Formation and Its Environment in the Center of Galaxies"
    November 12-16, 2012 (~1.5 weeks later)
    at TIARA in National Tsing Hua University (NTHU) in Hsinchu.

  https://www.tiara.sinica.edu.tw/activities/workshop/20121112/

As you can see in the program, we will have many forefront astronomers
in this field.  We do not have any registration, so if you are
interested in, please feel free to come, although the TIARA office is
small, so there will be a space limitation if there are too many people.

Thank you,
Satoki Matsushita
On behalf of the Organizing Committee

Dear Colleagues,

You are cordially invited to attend the Joint Colloquium
which will be held on November 20.
The Joint Colloquium Series is organized by
the NTU Physics Department, Center for Condensed Matter Science (CCMS),
Leung Center for Cosmology and Particle Astrophysics (LeCosPA),

and the Institute of Atomic and Molecular Sciences (IAMS).
The idea is to have excellent speakers to give inspiring, informative,
but non-technical talks on the frontiers of Sciences.

Enclosed below is the information of the Joint Colloquium on November 20.

Best regards,

Pisin Chen (LeCosPA)
Ting-Wai Chiu (NTU-Phys)

ASIAA/CCMS/IAMS/LeCosPA/NTU-Physics Joint Colloquium
Speaker: Prof. Xiao Gang He(何小剛 教授)
        (Physics Department, NTU)
        (Head of NCTS Physics Division)
Topic: The HMW Topological Phase
Time: 11/20 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:10
Place: Room 104, CCMS-New Physics Building

Brief Bio. :
    Professor He is currently on leave from NTU, serving as the head  
of the NCTS Physics Division. He has been a distinguished professor at  
NTU since 2008. In 1982, He graduated from University of Science and  
Technology in China, and earned a CUSPEA fellowship to further his  
graduate studies in the University of Hawaii and graduated in 1987  
with a Ph.D degree. After working at various institutions, he joined  
NTU in 1998 and became a full professor in 1999.
    Professor He has been conducting researches in particle physics,  
quantum mechanics and cosmology, and has published more than 160 SCI  
research papers. His major achievements include: Systematic studies of  
new physics the neutron electric dipole moment in the standard model  
and beyond (1987, 1989); first proposed the Type III seesaw model  
(1989); first discovered the He-McKellar-Wilkens phase (1992); first  
discovered the importance of electroweak penguin in the studies of B  
decays and CP violation; and independently proposed the trib-maximal  
mixing and associated modifications (2003, 2006). In recent years, he  
has been studying the dark matter, and Higgs physics related to LHC.

Abstract :
    Quantum mechanics predicts the existence of topological phase in  
interference phenomena. One of the most famous examples is the AB  
phase predicted by Aharonov and Bohm in 1959. It has been shown that  
there are several classes of topological phases involving  
electromagnetic interactions. In 1993, He and McKellar predicted the  
existence of a topological phase due to a particle with an electric  
dipole moment moving in a closed path which encloses a finite magnetic  
monopole density. A year later Wilkens also obtained the same result.  
This phase is called the HMW phase. This phase does not depend on how  
the path encloses the monopole density and therefore a topological  
one. Recently, it has been claimed that this phase has been observed  
in atom interferometry experiment. In this talk I will discuss in  
details the HMW phase and the experimental efforts to measure it.

  Title: The evolution links between galaxies and black holes

  Tea/Discussion Time is followed in the same room.

                    All Welcome !!

ABSTRACT:
I will present recent studies on the co-evolution of galaxies and the
super-massive black holes (SMBHs) in their centers. I will report the new
measurements ofthe average black hole accretion rateand star
formation rate (SFR) for galaxiesin the Bo\"{o}tes survey regionin
the redshift range$0.25<z<0.8$. With the advantage of
far-infrared($250\micron$) data taken by the \emph{Herschel
SpaceObservatory}, the SFR can be estimated withoutcontamination from
AGN. We found a global correlation between galactic SFR and the average
SMBH growth, which is consistent with a simple picture that the growths
of SMBHs and galaxies are closely linked over galaxy evolution time
scale.

Speaker:    Martin Kilbinger (CEA)
Topic:        Constraints on dark energy and modified gravity models from CFHTLenS
weak lensing
Time:        11/23 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
I present results from weak gravitational lensing by the large-scale structure
from CFHTLenS (Canada-France-Hawaii Lensing Survey). Using multi-band optical
data over 155 square degrees, we measure the weak lensing correlation of
high-redshift galaxies from small out to very large, linear scales. We
reconstruct the largest maps of dark matter ever made, and infer information on
cosmological parameters for flat and curved Lambda and dark-energy CDM models,
and modified gravity (the latter together with redshift-space distortions from
Wiggle-Z). In addition, by comparing the lensing observations with the light
distribution from galaxies, we measure the relation (bias and
cross-correlation) between total and luminous matter.

I will give an introduction to weak gravitational lensing and its use
in cosmology. I will present an overview over the CFHTLenS lensing analysis and
the likelihood and sampling methods (Population Monte Carlo, PMC). These
results will be put in a larger context of large on-going and planned ground-
and space-based galaxy surveys such as DES and Euclid.

See www.cfhtlens.org for links to the released data and more details.


*** Special Seminar

Speaker:    Jinhua He (Yunnan Astronomical Observatory)
Topic:        1.1-mm spectral line survey of EGOs -- similarity and randomness
Time:        11/20 (Tuesday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
We have performed a 1.1-mm spectral line survey to a sample of 89 GLIMPSE
extended green objects (EGOs) by using the SMT 10m. The survey covers
molecular line tracers of dense gas, hot gas and shocks. The indications
of the results will be discussed. Further combining this with our previous
observation of low density tracers, isotopic CO 1-0 lines toward the same
sample of EGOs, I will discuss the ubiquitous log-linear line luminosity
correlations among all the tracer lines and the data scatter.
I will try conclude that most of the EGO associated molecular clouds have
similarity in thermal and density structures and shock properties.
I will also try to demonstrate that the randomness in the cloud structure
and turbulence velocity field increases over larger ranges of cloud substructure
size scales or whole-cloud size scales.
