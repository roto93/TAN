Title: Direct Measurement of the CMB temperature anisotropy power spectrum from WMAP data
Abstract:
Angular power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature anisotropies
is one of the most important characteristics of the Universe which allows us to decide
its geometry and total density...etc. Using flat sky approximation and Fourier analysis,
we estimate the angular power spectrum from an ensemble of least foreground-contaminated
square patches from WMAP W and V frequency band map. This method circumvents the issue
of foreground cleaning and that of breaking orthogonality in spherical harmonic analysis
due to masking out the bright Galactic plane region, thereby rendering a direct
measurement of the angular power spectrum.

Title: Public Outreach at ASIAA
Abstract:
In order to engage with the general public, ASIAA started outreach effort as early as
2003, which is then expanded in 2010 in response to the recommendation in the Academia
Sinica 5-year Review. I will give an introduction of the public outreach effort at ASIAA.

*** Colloquium
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Dr. Megan Schwamb (NSF Fellow at Yale University)
Topic:        Extreme Orbits in the Outer Solar System (***note special date***)
Time:        5/24 (Thursday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
I'll present the results of observational campaigns to study and probe two families of extreme planetesimal orbits discovered in the outer solar system: the distant Sedna population and the high inclination Centaurs.

The discovery of Sedna on a highly eccentric orbit beyond Neptune challenges our understanding of the solar system and suggests the presence of a population of icy bodies residing past the Kuiper belt. With a perihelion of 76 AU, Sedna is well beyond the reach of the gas-giants and could not be scattered onto its highly eccentric orbit from interactions with Neptune alone. Sedna’s aphelion at ~1000 AU is too far from the edge of the solar system to feel the perturbing effects of passing stars or galactic tides in the present-day solar neighborhood. Some other mechanism no longer active in the solar system today is required to emplace Sedna on its orbit. Several possible scenarios have been offered to explain Sedna’s extreme orbit, including interactions with planet-sized bodies, stellar encounters, multiple stellar ﬂy-bys in a stellar birth cluster, interstellar capture, and perturbations from a wide-binary solar companion. These planetesimals in the Sedna region are d!
ynamically frozen and the relics of their formation process. Finding just a handful of these bodies, we can begin to read this dynamical record. I will discuss the implications for a distant Sedna-like population beyond the Kuiper belt. I will present the results from surveys designed to search for additional members of the Sedna population and discuss future prospects for detecting and studying these distant bodies, focusing in particular on the constraints we can place on the embedded stellar cluster environment the early Sun may be have been born in.

The discovery of 2008 KV42 with a perihelion near Uranus and an extreme (nearly perpendicular) inclination of 104 degrees, suggests a population of bodies on similar orbits with high inclinations compared to typical KBOs and Centaurs. In the La Silla-QUEST KBO Survey, we have found the third new member of this high-inclination population, 2010 WG9 with an inclination of 70 degrees and a perihelion of 18.7 AU. These high inclination (i > 60 degrees) Centaurs are metastable gravitationally interacting and scattering off of Uranus and Neptune with lifetimes of hundreds of million years, suggesting there must be a source population feeding this unstable reservoir. I'll discuss the evidence that these objects are escapees from the Oort cloud rather than originating in the Kuiper belt and present observational constraints on the size and orbital distribution of such a population of extreme high-inclination orbits in the Kuiper belt.

Speaker:    Prof. Jean-François Roch (Laboratoire Aimé Cotton)
Topic:        Nanoscale optical and magnetic imaging using color centers in diamond nanoparticles
Time:        5/22 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:30
Place:        R104, CCMS-New Physics Building
Abstract:
Numerous works have been devoted to the development of efficient probes for nanoscale imaging. I will report the application of optically and magnetically active nanodiamonds to nanoscale mapping using the unique properties of the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color center. The NV center is hosted in a diamond nanocrystal which is attached to the tip of an atomic force microscope. Combining nanometer scale spatial resolution, high sensitivity and room temperature operation, this NV-based scanning microscope opens up numerous perspectives in nanotechnology.

Speaker:    Dr. Michael Mumma (Department of Astronomy, University of Maryland and NASA-Goddard Space Flight Center)
Topic:        The Chemical Composition of Comets: Emerging Taxonomies and Natal Heritage
Time:        5/23 (Wednesday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
Viewed from a cosmic perspective, Earth is a dry planet yet its oceans are 
enriched in deuterium by a large factor relative to nebular hydrogen. Can 
comets have delivered Earth’s water? The question of exogenous delivery of 
water and organics to Earth and other young planets is of critical 
importance for understanding the origin of Earth’s water, and for assessing 
the possible existence of exo-planets similar to Earth.

Strong gradients in temperature and chemistry in the proto-planetary disk, 
coupled with dynamical models, imply that comets from the Oort Cloud and 
Kuiper Disk reservoirs should have diverse composition. The primary 
volatiles in comets (ices native to the nucleus) provide the preferred 
metric, and taxonomies based on them are now beginning to emerge [1, 2, 3]. 
The measurement of cosmic parameters such as the nuclear spin temperatures 
for H2O, NH3, and CH4, and of enrichment factors for isotopologues (D/H in 
water and hydrogen cyanide, 14N/15N in CN and HCN) provide additional 
important tests for the origin of cometary material.

I will provide an overview of these aspects, and their implications for the 
origin of Earth’s water and prebiotic organics.
