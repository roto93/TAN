> Subject: Notice of Intent for ALMA Cycle 1 by May 15.

Dear Potential ALMA users,

The deadline to submit a "Notice of Intent" is May 15 (see below). You may 
go to one of the following:
http://almascience.nao.ac.jp/call-for-proposals
https://almascience.nrao.edu/call-for-proposals

Please note that users need to be registered and logged in to the ALMA
Science Portal to access the Notice of Intent form.

Notices of Intent

To help ensure that the observatory is as well prepared as possible to 
assess the proposals submitted for Cycle 1, Principal Investigators are 
strongly encouraged to submit a notice of intent by May 15 using the 
following web form (http://almascience.nao.ac.jp/call-for-proposals). One 
form should be completed and submitted for each planned Cycle 1 proposal. 
This should not require more than a few minutes since the information to 
be provided is minimal.

Best Regards,
Chin-Fei
On behalf of Taiwan ARC node
