Dear HSC lovers in Taiwan,


HSC (Hyper Suprime Cam) of Subaru telescope will be made available very soon, and I am happy to circulate information on the following HSC workshop on Super Massive Black Holes and AGNs to be held in this December in Japan to Taiwan colleagues. This is an international workshop for all partners (Princeton, Japan, and Taiwan), and your contribution is VERY MUCH WELCOME. I hope I (Youichi) can help you as a LOC member for Taiwan colleagues, and so feel free to ask me (as well as to Tohru, the SOC/LOC chair) your questions if any.


Regards,
Youichi Ohyama (ASIAA)


First Circular:
Workshop on SMBHs in the Universe: The Era of the HSC Surveys


==============================
18--20 December 2012
Ehime University, Matsuyama, Japan
http://astro.edu.nagasaki-u.ac.jp/HSC-AGN2012/
==============================



The formation and evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are
among the most exciting and challenging topics in astronomy and
astrophysics. New wide-field deep surveys are required to tackle
these issues, and Subaru's new wide-field camera (Hyper Suprime-Cam;
HSC) will bring promising opportunities to make breakthroughs in
this research field. Since the operation of HSC will start soon,
now it is a good time to have an intensive face-to-face discussion
among interested astronomers in the HSC collaboration (i.e., Japan,
Princeton, and Taiwan).


The main goals of this meeting are understanding the current status
of the HSC development and the strategy of the data analysis,
sharing scientific ideas on SMBH studies using the HSC data, and
promoting various collaborations on SMBH studies among the
researchers. We will focus on doing science and writing papers based
on the very early data of the coming HSC surveys. These discussions
in advance of the start of the HSC surveys will maximize the
scientific output in the theme of SMBH studies.


We will focus on the following topics, among others:
  -- Current status of the HSC hardware and software
  -- Survey plans and output photometric catalogs
  -- Quasar selection methods
  -- Statistics of quasars and SMBHs from the HSC data
  -- Co-evolution studies of SMBHs and galaxies with the HSC data
  -- Synergies of HSC and multi-wavelength data for SMBH studies
  -- Strategies for spectroscopic follow-up. Looking forward to PFS.
  -- Theoretical preparations for HSC quasar surveys
  -- Action items for the HSC surveys


This meeting will take place in Matsuyama, on Shikoku Island, about
a 2 hour flight from Tokyo. Matsuyama is famous for the Dogo-Onsen
hot spring, which is believed to be the oldest hot spring in Japan.
The details of the registration, abstract submission, travel info,
and so on will be announced in the second circular, which will be
distributed at the end of September.
If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us (see
below). We are looking forward to seeing you in Matsuyama!

  -- 30 Sep.: Second circular distribution

> 
> ALMA is expected to allow a significant step forward in our understanding of the processes regulating the physical and chemical structure of the interstellar medium in a variety of astrophysical environments from star and planet forming regions to late type stars and galaxies. It is now time to review the scientific output of the many Herschel and ground based molecular line surveys conducted in recent years, present ALMA early science results and identify the outstanding scientific questions that can be addressed with ALMA. 
> 
> In the workshop we expect to review and discuss the results of ongoing surveys especially in view of the need of high angular resolution requirements for proper analysis and line identification. The full ALMA array will provide the much needed image fidelity and sensitivity to determine whether complex molecules originate at the same or different locations. Another key topic that we will address are the relative merits of performing ALMA complete spectral scans versus a more careful selection of spectral regions to answer the specific scientific questions. At the workshop we will also discuss the progress with the advanced data analysis tools for line surveys that have been and are being developed in Europe in the framework of the Herschel and ALMA preparations initiatives and with the support of Astronet (ARTIST, CASSIS and CATS), as well as those developed elsewhere. Finally, we will review recent results from laboratory astrophysics and what is needed for interpreting i!
ncoming data - e.g., in terms more complete line lists and collision rate coefficients.

Dear Colleagues,

You are cordially invited to attend the Joint Colloquium
which will be held on September 25 (next Tuesday).
The Joint Colloquium Series is organized by
the NTU Physics Department, Center for Condensed Matter Science (CCMS),
Leung Center for Cosmology and Particle Astrophysics (LeCosPA),
Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA),
and the Institute of Atomic and Molecular Sciences (IAMS).
The idea is to have excellent speakers to give inspiring, informative,
but non-technical talks on the frontiers of Sciences.

Enclosed below is the information of the Joint Colloquium on September  
25. Moreover, we would like to draw your attention to two special  
colloquiums
to be held after the Joint Colloquium, on the related subject.
Please help to forward this to the colleagues in your departments.

Colloquium
Speaker: Prof. Sachio Komamiya (Tokyo U.)
Topic: History of Particle Physics and Linear Collider
Time: 09/25 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:10
Place: Room 104, CCM-New Physics Building

Abstract:
A new particle which is compatible with a Higgs boson is discovered in  
July this year with LHC at CERN. Detailed research of Higgs boson  
opens a new window to particle physics beyond the Standard Model. The  
Japanese community of high energy physics endorsed a final report of  
subcommittee of future projects. The highest priority is to the  
International e+e- linear collider (ILC) project.. The Technical  
Design Report of ILC will be completed in the end of this year. Two  
Japanese candidate sites of ILC are under study with official funding.  
Considering the above facts, now it is time to present importance and  
strategy of ILC as a possible globel project hosted by Japan. After a  
brief presentation of history and unsolved questions in particle  
physics, ILC project will be presented.

Abstract:
The International Linear Collider is anticipated to be the next  
energy-frontier electron-positron accelerator based on superconducting  
radio-frequency (SCRF) technology, and to accelerate electron and  
positron beams up to 250 GeV each (500 GeV cms in collision) with  
having extend-ability up to 500 GeV each 1 TeV cms).
In this seminar, we report status of the technical design and R&D  
efforts carried out in the Technical Design phase since 2007, and  
discusses further plans after completion of the Technical Design  
Report (TDR) in 2012.
