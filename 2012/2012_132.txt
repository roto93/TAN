Speaker:    Dr. Eiichiro Komatsu (MPA)
Topic:        Critical Tests of Theory of the Early Universe using the Cosmic Microwave Background
Time:        7/16 (Monday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), the fossil light of the Big Bang, is the oldest light that one can ever hope to observe in our Universe. The CMB provides us with a direct image of the Universe when it was still an "infant" - 380,000 years old - and has enabled us to obtain a wealth of cosmological information, such as the composition, age, geometry, and history of the Universe. Yet, can we go further and learn about the primordial universe, when it was much younger than 380,000 years old, perhaps as young as a tiny fraction of a second? If so, this gives us a hope to test competing theories about the origin of the Universe at ultra high energies. In this talk I review the present status and future prospects on our quest to probe the physical condition of the very early Universe.

Topic:        Shocks, Turbulence, and Magnetic FIelds in Galaxy Clusters  and the Large-Scale Structure of the Universe
Time:        7/20 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
The cosmological structure formation simulations have shown that 
the intracluster medium (ICM) in galaxy clusters and the warm-hot 
intergalactic medium (WHIM) in filaments of galaxies are mostly heated by 
the shock waves caused by multiple mergers and accretions of galaxies, 
galaxy groups, and clusters. Actually, the shocks have been observed 
in some merging galaxy clusters, that are useful laboratories for studying 
plasma astrophysics. For instance, X-ray emissions from the ICM in the 
electron-ion two temperature structure and the non-equilibrium ionization 
state and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effects of very hot ICM have been studied. 
It is also predicted that the cosmological shocks could generate the 
intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF) in the ICM and WHIM and could 
amplify it through turbulence dynamo, but observational evidences 
for the origin and evolution are not enough yet. Theoretical estimations 
of RM due to the IGMF in filaments of galaxies is 1-10 rad/m2, which 
could be observed with the ASKAP POSSUM by using the so-called RM 
synthesis. The above studies could be tested with international observatories 
such as Astro-H, ALMA, and SKA.

Speaker:    Prof. Sara beck (Tel Aviv University)
Topic:        Heavy Metal and High Resolution: Gas Kinematics of Embedded Star Clusters
Time:        7/18 (Wednesday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
RISN, Radio-Infared Supernebulae, are excited by young, deeply embedded star clusters. They are to Extragalactic Super Star Clusters as Ultra-compact HII regions are to Galactic OB stars, and, like UC HII regions, the internal kinematics  are puzzling.  Ionized gas motions in RISN have until now been measured via infrared and radio hydrogen lines,  and have been found to be too fast for sound, too slow for stellar winds, and inconsistent with the cluster ages. We show that hydrogen lines are inherently too  broad to probe kinematics in these sources--they must be observed with metal lines.  We have measured the ionized gas in the RISN of several well-known starburst galaxies with effective resolution--including thermal broadening--of ~5 km/sec and can for the first time see their gas motions in detail.  We find many sources are undergoing bulk outflows, probably pressure driven. These could be analogous to the 'champagne flow' model, but for giant clusters instead of individ!
ual stars, and may explain RISN lifetimes. Other remarkable kinematic features, including sub-clusters, can be detected with these heavy metal lines. We argue that high spectral resolution requires extra observational effort, but is worth it.
