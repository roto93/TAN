Dear Colleagues,

The NTU Physics Department, Center for Condensed Matter Science, Institute
of Atomic and Molecular Sciences, and the Academia Sinica Institute of
Astronomy and Astrophysics invite everyone to our joint colloquium series.
The speakers are all famous international scholars and the colloquia are
aiming at a broad audience, including undergraduate students. Below is the
information of the talk on March 27(Tuesday). Please help to forward this
to the colleagues in your departments.

Best Regards,
Chih-Wei Chang (CCMS)

Speaker: Chung-Pei Ma, UC Berkeley
 Topic: Monster Black Holes
Time: 03/27 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:10
Place: Chin-Pao Yang Lecture Hall (r104), CCM-New Physics Building

Abstract: Black holes are among the most fascinating astrophysical objects
and have long entranced the public. For over three decades, the giant
elliptical galaxy Messier 87 has hosted the most massive known black hole
in the local Universe. I will describe the recent discovery of  two
record-breaking black holes, each with ten billion solar masses, in an
ongoing survey of centers of nearby massive galaxies. The existence of
these supermassive black holes have interesting implications for the growth
of the largest galaxies in the Universe.

Brief Bio: Professor Ma is a theoretical cosmologist and astrophysicist.
She received both her undergraduate and Ph.D. degrees in physics from the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Before joining the faculty at UC
Berkeley in 2002, she was a postdoctoral fellow at the California Institute
of Technology and an Assistant and Associate Professor of Physics and
Astronomy at the University of Pennsylvania, where she won the Lindback
Award for Distinguished Teaching. She has also won the Maria Goeppert Mayer
Award (2003), OYRA (2001), Annie J. Cannon Award (1997), and Cottrell
Scholar. Ma is an avid violin player and was an exchange student at the New
England Conservatory of Music in Boston while studying cosmic strings and
theoretical cosmology at MIT.  She was the first prize winner in the Taiwan
National Violin Competition in 1983. Ma is the cosmology scientific editor
for the Astrophysical Journal.

FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT: BLACK HOLE UNIVERSE 2012
********************************************

Bamberg, Germany, 18-22 June 2012

Dear colleagues,

following a series of two summer schools and the 2011 Winchester
workshop on Black Hole Astrophysics, the European Union Initial
Training Network "Black Hole Universe" is convening the final
conference of the network, "Black Hole Universe 2012", from 18 June
until 22 June 2012 in Bamberg, Germany.

*TOPICS*

The aim of the conference (http://www.black-hole.eu/bhu2012) is to
provide an overview of the most important subjects in black hole
astrophysics through a series of 40 minute long review talks and 20
minute long scientific talks.

The conference is aimed towards both graduate students and young
researchers, as well as astrophysicists working in the field. In line
with the theme of the network, the conference will cover all types of
accreting astrophysical black holes in all wavebands, from X-ray
binary systems through ULXs to AGN, with a particular emphasis on
making connections across the mass and luminosity scales based on the
common physics between them and with other compact objects such as
neutron stars. Specific topics include:

* In- and outflows: Theory and Observations
 - accretion in AGN and Galactic black holes
 - Low-luminosity states of Black Hole Accretion

* Relativity and Black Holes
 - Relativistic iron lines
 - Gravitational waves from black holes

* Populations and Formation of Black Holes
 - Binary populations
 - Formation of Galactic Black Holes
 - Black Hole evolution

* Future Observational Needs and Theoretical Challenges

Invited speakers include Tamara Bogdanovic, Laura Brenneman, Jason
Dexter, Chris Fryer, Ryan Hickox, Jonathan McKinney, Joey Neilsen,
Michael A. Nowak and Francesca Panessa.

*VENUE AND ACCOMMODATION*

The conference will be held in the historic "Spiegelsaal" in the
center of Bamberg, Germany. The medieval center of Bamberg and its art
nouveau suburbs is a UNESCO world heritage site, with more than 2000
buildings on the state register of historic places. Accommodation
(45-70 EUR per night and person including breakfast) has been reserved
in good hotels in walking distance from the venue and the center.
Please see
http://www.black-hole.eu/index.php/schools-workshops-and-conferences/bhu2012/venue-and-accommodation
for further information.


*CONFERENCE FEES AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT*

The registration fee for the conference will be 100 EUR for attendants
without a PhD and 200 EUR for attendants with a PhD. This fee includes
the conference booklet, conference dinner, and all coffee breaks.

Limited financial support is available, especially for graduate
students and for scientists from non-1st world countries. Support can
include conference fee waivers, (partial) support for accommodation,
and travel support. In order to request support, during registration
please submit a PDF with a short description of your scientific
interest and funding. In case of PhD students, please attach a letter
of support from the thesis supervisor. Decisions will be made on a
case-by-case basis by early May.

*REGISTRATION AND ABSTRACT SUBMISSION*

Registration and abstract deadline: 30 April 2012
Hotel booking deadline: 30 April 2012
Conference: 18-22 June 2012

Registration is now open at

Dear all, upcoming Colloquium at IANCU (S4-Room 1013) is:

Title: The Magnetized Environment of the W3(H2O) Massive Protostars
Speaker: Dr. Vivien Chen (NTHU)
Date: 2012-03-30
Time: 14:00-15:00
Location: NCU, S4-1013
Abstract:

Synchrotron emission has been observed in a few massive protostellar objects. In this
talk, I will report our observations of polarized dust emission around the W3(H2O)
protostars at 878um with the Submillimeter Array (SMA). This source harbors an accreting
proto-binary system consisting of two early B-type protostars. One of the protostars is
known to be associated with a synchrotron jet. Our observations resolves the polarized
emission and shows a magnetic field orientation well agree with the synchrotron bipolar
jet. It provides evidence for the presence of such magnetized environment that perhaps
helps the collimation of the bipolar jet in early phase of massive star formation.
