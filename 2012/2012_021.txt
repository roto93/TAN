Dear Prof. Kuan, 

I should appreciate it if you could advertise the following seminars 
on TAN. 

Thank you very much. 

Kouichi Hirotani (ASIAA/TIARA, NTHU) 

--------------------  (Please cut here.)  -------------------------- 

Prof. Tsvi Piran (Racah Institute for Physics, Hebrew University), 
a leading gamma-ray burst physicist, will give two lectures at 
National Tsing Hua University (NTHU). 
Everybody is cordially invited to participate the lectures. 

Feb 13 (Mon)  11:00-12:00, Room 620, Physics Building, NTHU 

  Introductory talk: 
  "Gamma-Ray Bursts - the strongest explosions in the Universe" 

Feb 13 (Mon)  13:30-14:30, Room 620, Physics Building, NTHU 

  Advanced talk: 
  "Progenitors of long and short GRBs" 

Since Prof. Piran will be staying in NTHU during Feb 9-13, 
please feel free to visit ASIAA/TIARA in NTHU campus also on 
Feb 9 (afternoon) and 10 (all day) to meet him.

> Subject: ALMA Cycle 0 status and SV data

Dear ALMA users,

There are two pieces of information in this message.

1. Cycle 0 status and the timeline for Cycle 1.

ALMA started scientific operations on 30 September 2011. While the quality
of the data being collected is excellent, the completion rate of projects is
lower than planned.  To increase the likelihood that most PIs of the highest
priority Cycle 0 projects will receive scientifically valuable data sets,
the Cycle 0 observing period will be extended until the end of 2012.  This
extension will not delay completion of the array.

The observatory plans to release information regarding the capabilities and
timeline for ALMA Early Science Cycle 1 in April 2012.  The proposal
deadline is expected to be in July 2012 with the start of Cycle 1
observations at the beginning of 2013.

For more details, please check the following link:
http://almascience.nao.ac.jp/news/alma-early-science-cycle-0-status-report


2. Science Verification Data

The ALMA Observatory uses Science Verification (SV) to demonstrate
that ALMA data is valid, as compared to other existing similar data
taken by millimeter and submillimeter observatories, like the
Submillimeter Array (SMA).  ALMA has released SV data to the world
community already, and it will continue to do so.

Available released SV data and related information:
http://almascience.nao.ac.jp/alma-data/science-verification

Some of these data includes guidelines for the calibration and imaging parts.

The Taiwan ARC node reminds the Taiwanese community that is totally valid to
publish scientific results originated from the analysis of released SV data. 
The ARC strongly encourages the Taiwanese community to do so.

The following is an extract from the ALMA Observatory, please check the above 
link to get more information, as well as to download the data.

Using the data for publication

The following statement should be included in the acknowledgment of
papers using the datasets listed above: "The Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), an international astronomy
facility, is a partnership of Europe, North America and East Asia in
cooperation with the Republic of Chile. This paper makes use of the
following ALMA Science Verification data:
ADS/JAO.ALMA#2011.0.0000X.SV", where X=1 for the TW Hya dataset, X=2
for the NGC3256 dataset, X=3 for the Antennae mosaics, X=4 for M100
and X=5 for the SgrA* data.

Best Regards,
Chin-Fei
On behalf of the Taiwan ARC Node

Dear all,

Per Prof. Pisin Chen's request, please announce the following talk by
Prof. Veneziano through the joint colloquium mailing list. Prof.
Veneziano is also an invited speaker in the coming LeCosPA symposium:
http://lecospa.ntu.edu.tw/LeCosPA2012/program.php

A pre-talk lunch will be organized. Please come to the 4F mail room of
the CCMS-Phys building at 12:20 pm on Feb.10 if you are interested.

Cheers,

Jiunn-Wei Chen

Time:
2/10(Friday)  2:20pm -3:10pm
Place:
R810 Math & Astro-phys building (TBC)
Speaker:
Prof. Gabriele Veneziano
(College of France in Paris, France)
see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriele_Veneziano
Title:
Transplanckian scattering of particles, strings, and branes
Abstract:
I will review some 25 years of work on transplanckian-energy
collisions in string theory, a "gedanken" experiment addressing some
fundamental theoretical issues in quantum/string gravity. Its goals
include an information-preserving description of black-hole formation
and evaporation,  understanding the nature of string-induced
short-distance modifications of gravity, and formulating the AdS/CFT
correspondence within a strict S-matrix framework. The talk will be as
little technical as possible.
