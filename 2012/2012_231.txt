*** Special Seminar
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Julian Merten (Caltech/JPL)
Topic:        Creation of cosmic structure in clusters of galaxies
Time:        12/4 (Tuesday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
The widely accepted current standard model of cosmology predicts a hierarchical scenario of structure formation. Driven by small initial seed overdensities, structure collapses due to gravity and decouples from the Hubble flow. Through a subsequent sequence of mergers large and massive dark matter dominated halos form. The largest structures we observe today in this bottom-up scenario are clusters of galaxies and as the youngest structures to date, clusters are rendered as ideal laboratories to test our standard picture of structure formation. While observable in many different wavelength regimes, clusters reveal their mass components to the observerﾃ不 eye. In my talk I will present the latest results from the HST/MCT programme CLASH, which spends a significant amount of Hubble observing time on the study of a sample of 25 galaxy clusters. Properties like the dark matter density profile of halos can be determined to high precision and when used as cosmic telescopes, cluster!
s allow a peak at the very young Universe. Furthermore, I will present the latest results from the study of merging clusters of galaxies, like the Bullet and Pandoraﾃ不 Cluster. Those most energetic events in the Universe provide the unique opportunity to observe the different matter components of the Universe under extreme conditions and allow for the direct derivation of microscopical properties of dark matter. For this reason a Cluster Merger Collaboration (MC^2) has been created to study mergers in the context of alternative dark matter models. I will end in outlining this project.
