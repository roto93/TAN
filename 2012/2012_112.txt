Next Monday, June 11, the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) will 
broadcast a series of presentations designed to prepare the community for 
the upcoming ALMA (July 12) and Jansky VLA-GBT-VLBA (August 1) observing 
proposal deadlines. Each of these telescopes offers world-class 
capabilities, including significant new capabilities for the VLA and ALMA 
that are being offered for the first time at these deadlines.

The broadcast presentations will familiarize users with the process of 
proposing and the capabilities offered at these deadlines. Time for Q & A 
will be available for each facility. Participation will be via a 
combination of web-broadcast and dial-in audio. Registration is required 
so that we can distribute connection information.

We request that interested attendees register on-line by 8 pm Eastern Time 
this Friday, June 8.

Please feel free to forward this announcement to potentially interested 
parties. Those unfamiliar with NRAO telescopes are particularly encouraged 
to attend.
