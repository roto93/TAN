MEETING TITLE:
Cosmic Dust

WEBSITE:
https://www.cps-jp.org/~dust/

VENUE:
CPS (Center for Planetary Science), Kobe, JAPAN
https://www.cps-jp.org/access/

DATE:
August 6-10, 2012

OBJECTIVES:

This is the fifth meeting on Cosmic Dust. This series of Cosmic Dust
meetings aims at finding a consensus among experts on the formation
and evolution of cosmic dust: where it comes from and where it
goes. The meeting is organized by dust freaks who are very
enthusiastic not only to make the goal achievable but also to
establish a dust community across Asian and Oceanian countries for the
development of cosmic dust research worldwide. For this reason, the
primary objectives of the meeting are to bring together professionals
who deal with cosmic dust and to provide an opportunity for
participants to develop human relations and interactions between the
participants.

SCOPE:

All kinds of cosmic dust such as

• intergalactic dust
• interstellar dust
• protoplanetary disk dust
• debris disk dust
• cometary dust
• asteroidal dust
• interplanetary dust
• circumplanetary dust
• stellar nebular condensates
• presolar grains
• micrometeorites
• meteoroids
• meteors
• regolith particles

are the subject of discussion. The meeting is open for any aspects of
dust research by means of different methods of studies (in-situ and
laboratory measurements, astronomical observations, laboratory and
numerical analogue simulations, theoretical modeling, etc.). All
dust-related topics, for example, the formation of molecules and their
reactions on and their desorption from the surface of dust particles,
are also welcome. Publishing the proceedings of this meeting as a
special issue of a peer-reviewed journal is currently being planned,
while paper submission to the proceedings is not obligatory.

ADMISSIONS APPLICATION:

Please complete online meeting application at the CPS website in order
to attend the meeting. Because the number of participants shall be
limited, the online application does not guarantee admission to the
meeting. Participants will be determined at the discretion of the SOC
and all applicants will be notified of the admissions
decision. Priority will be given to those who contribute to oral or
poster sessions and retain enthusiasm for discussions throughout the
meeting. For further details, please visit the Cosmic Dust website.

BRIEF HISTORY:

The Cosmic Dust meeting started in 2006 as a session called “Cosmic
Dust” of the 3rd AOGS (Asia-Oceania Geoscience Society) annual
meeting in Singapore. Dust freaks have kept on organizing the session
at subsequent AOGS meetings in South Korea (2008), India (2010), and
Taiwan (2011). The Cosmic Dust series has been recognized as the most
successful session of the AOGS Planetary Sciences Section. In 2012,
the time is ripe for being free from organizing restrictions on the
AOGS meeting. Therefore, the fifth meeting of the Cosmic Dust series
becomes detached, totally independent of any international
conference. The past meetings on Cosmic Dust have been held in a
relaxed and joyful atmosphere. So will be the coming one!

Dear All,

I'm glad to tell you that the website is finally open.
Everyone is now accessible to the website.
Thank you very much for your cooperation.

Let's distribute the announcement all over the world!
Please also personally suggest your colleagues to attend the meeting.

Lusya, could you please circulate it to PEN and ELSNEWS?
Tetsuo, could you do the same to The Japanese Society for Planetary
Sciences? And could you also ask Takayuki Tanigawa to post it to
Taiwan Astronomy Network?
Akio, could you please circulate it to The Astronomical Society of Japan?
Keiko, could you do the same to Stardusters? And if you know someone
who could put our meeting into the LPI's meeting calendar, please ask.
Tetsuo and Sasha, could you also do the same to the participants in
your past meeting on Dust in Planetary Systems 2010?
Sasha and Conny, if you know any mailing list for German or European
communities of astronomy or related fields, please post it over such a
mailing list.
Aigen, if you know any mailing list for Chinese colleagues, please post it.
I will ask Canadian Astronomy Data Centre to put our meeting into
their calendar.
They will also announce it to American Astronomical Society,
International Astronomical Union, and NASA Astrophysics Data System.
I will also ask IUCAA to distribute the announcement to Indian
institutes and universities.
Is there any more possibilities?
Do you know how to put the announcement to AGU or EGU newsletters?
Thanks a lot in advance!!

Hiroshi
