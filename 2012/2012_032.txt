Topic:		The Megamaser Cosmology Project : Accurate Determination of the Hubble Constant and the Masses of the Supermassive Black Holes at the centers of Megamaser Galaxies
Time:		2/24 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:		 R1203
Abstract:
The primary goal of the Megamaser Cosmology Project is to determine the
Hubble constant H0  3\% accuracy in order to constrain the equation of state
parameter w of dark energy.  The key to achieving this goal is to measure
accurate distances to galaxies well into the Hubble flow (50 - 200
Mpc).  A proven method to measure accurate angular-diameter distances involves
sub-milliarcsecond resolution imaging of H2O maser emission from sub-parsec circumnuclear disks at the center of active galaxies, a technique established by the study of NGC 4258 with VLBI. As the Megamaser Cosmology Project discovers and images megamaser disks, an important result, in addition to the Hubble constant determination, is the accurate measurement of the masses of the supermassive black holes at the centers of these megamaser galaxies
In this talk, I will present the latest results on the Hubble constant
determination from the Megamaser Cosmology Project. In addition, I will also show the black hole mass measurements and their impact on our understanding of hte famous M-sigma relation.
