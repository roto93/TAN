We would like to invite you to attend and present a paper at the AOGS 2012
session

PS12 on ¡§Microwave and Infrared Remote Sensing of Solar System Objects¡¨

This session will address all aspects of investigations of the terrestrial and other atmospheres in the solar system and beyond as well as surface properties of solar system bodies, using remote sensing techniques in the cm, mm, submm and infrared wavelengths range. This includes new ground-based, air- and spaceborne instrument developments, development proposals and related topics (i.e. frontends, backends, receivers, spectrometers, interferometers, components, mechanisms, concepts, calibration, the baseline problem, etc.), radiative transfer and retrieval simulations, new observations (Earth, planets, exoplanets, comets, moons, asteroids, KBOs, etc. from the ground, airborne and space borne), their validation, analysis and interpretation (e.g. atmospheric dynamics, chemistry and evolution, surface mineralogy, thermo-physical properties, regolith studies etc.). Specially welcome are presentations of Herschel results and on the newly proposed FIRE/MELOS instrument.

Hi Sebastien,

  Could we prevail upon your goodwill once again, and ask if
it is possible to circulate this call for proposals announcement
through appropriate mailing lists around Taiwan?

Many thanks,
Andrew

       Call for AAT proposals in Semester 2012B

The proposal deadline for AAT time in Semester 12B (1 August 2012
to 28 February 2013) is:

        Thursday, 15 March 2012, at 17:00**
 (Australian Eastern Standard Time, i.e. UTC + 10 hrs)

** Note the new closing time.

Proposals can be submitted from 1 March 2012 using the AAT online
proposal form, and are welcome from astronomers worldwide.

General information on applying for AAT time can be found at:
http://www.aao.gov.au/astro/**apply/ATAC_AAT.html<http://www.aao.gov.au/ast=
ro/apply/ATAC_AAT.html>

Important notes for 12B applicants:

* A call for Large Programs will NOT be made in Semester 12B or 13A.
Since ~50% of time available to ATAC is pre-allocated to existing
Large and Long-Term Programs, and since we expect significant
down-time in 13A while commissioning HERMES, we anticipate the next
call for Large Programs will be no earlier than Semester 13B.

Dear all, below is the information for upcoming colloquium at IANCU:

Title: Suzaku Observations of Radio lobes in Active Galaxies
Speaker: Dr. Hiromi Seta (Saitama University/Rikkyo University)
Date: 2012-03-09
Time: 14:00-15:00
Location: NCU, S4-1013
Abstract:

The jet from active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is one of the most gigantic features of
energy concentration and release in the universe. At the center of AGNs lies a super
massive black hole, which powers the jet fueled by mass accretion. The jet with a
relativistic velocity releases a massive amount of energy in the intergalactic medium
such as radio lobes. The radio lobes accumulate energy and materials transported by the
jets for a long time. The radio lobes are thus a probe to estimate the amount of energy
emitted by the jet. However, because the emission from the lobes is diffuse and faint,
it is difficult to observe in the X-rays. We present the results of the Suzaku
observations of radio lobes of active galaxies. The Suzaku is Japan's X-ray satellite.
One of the characteristic features of Suzaku is low background due to the lower orbit
compared with other X-ray satellite. Thus Suzaku is good at observing diffuse and
obsolete emission such as that from radio lobes. The highlights of the results are (1)
the detection of high energy emission from the lobe, (2) the estimation of the evolution
of the jet, and (3) the detection of thermal emission from the lobe.

Abstract: http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/activity/colloquium.php

*** Colloquium
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:	Stephane Guilloteau (Laboratoire d'Astrophysique de Bordeaux (LAB), Floirac, France)
Topic:		Molecular and continuum surveys as tools to determine the structure of protoplanetary disks: part II
Time:		3/9 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:		 R1203
Abstract:
The study of protoplanetary disks is essential to understand
how planetary systems form. Because of the small apparent sizes
of these discs, and of their low temperatures, mm interferometry
is a key to unveil the physical conditions in which planets may form.

In the first part, we shall show what has been learned from the still
relatively rare high resolution molecular line observations in terms
of temperature and chemistry, and how this compares to our a priori concepts
of proto-planetary disks, in particular the layered structure that all
chemical models predict. The complete inventory of molecules
will be presented, and perspectives for ALMA discussed.

In the second part, the informations derived from molecules will be compared
to those derived from dust observations. Progress towards constraining the
disk mass, a fundamental yet largely unconstrained  parameter will be reported.
Beyond this simple number, we will explore how the dust to gas ratio can be
studied, in particular in view of the recent and on coming progress in 
observational facilities.

Dear colleagues,

     First Announcement of the 3rd Fermi Asian Network (FAN) Workshop

     http://heastro.cnu.ac.kr/fan3.htm

    On behalf of the SOC, I am pleased to announce that the 3rd Fermi
Asian Network (FAN) Workshop
will be held in Chungnam National University, Daejeon, South Korea in
the period of 20-24 June 2012.

    FAN was established in 2012 to promote the collaborations among
the high energy astrophysicists
in Asia, with particular focus on using the data obtained by Fermi
Gamma-ray Space Telescope for
observational and theoretical investigations. The FAN collaboration
currently consists of astrophysicists
mainly from Taiwan, Hong Kong and Korea. Over the last two years, we
have published a series of papers
on various topics related to compact objects and their environment.

This workshop will be focused on the following topics:

* Rotation-powered pulsars & their wind nebulae
* Magnetars
* Gamma-ray binaries
* Supernova remnants
* Galactic center
* AGN
* Gamma-ray transients
* Unidentified Fermi objects

Apart from the formal presentations, this workshop will also emphasize
on the round-table discussion so as
to facilitate further collaborations. We will also hold a mini
hands-on training course to help student and postdocs
to analyze Fermi data.

However, such format cannot accommodate a large group. Thus the total
number of participants will be limited to about 30.

Invited Speakers:
Alice Harding (NASA Goddard Space Flight Center)
Paul Ray (Navy Research Laboratory)
Jun Kataoka (Waseda University)
Wim Hermsen (SRON-Netherlands Institute for Space Research)

Registration:
There is no registration fee and everyone is invited to participate in
this workshop.
Accommodation support (on sharing basis) for overseas students will be
provided. Participants are
encourage to make contributed talks related to the workshop.
Coffee/tea break will be provided throughout
the workshop. We will also arrange an excursion+conference dinner on 22 June.

Please visit http://heastro.cnu.ac.kr/fan3.htm for registration. The
deadline is on 30 April.

Accommodation:
Block-booked accommodation will be provided in Hotel Interciti
http://www.hotelinterciti.com/
which locates at a ~20 min walking distance from CNU campus. Shuttle
bus will be arranged to take the participants
from the hotel to the workshop venue in the morning and and back to
the hotel in the evening.
Accommodation support can be provided for the nights from 19 June to 24 June.

The workshop is sponsored by the National Research Foundation of Korea
and Chungnam National University.

I am looking forward to meeting you in Daejeon.

With best regards,
David Hui
