Time:

Speaker:
Prof. Gabriele Veneziano

Title:
Transplanckian scattering of particles, strings, and branes
Abstract:
I will review some 25 years of work on transplanckian-energy
collisions in string theory, a "gedanken" experiment addressing some
fundamental theoretical issues in quantum/string gravity. Its goals
include an information-preserving description of black-hole formation
and evaporation,  understanding the nature of string-induced
short-distance modifications of gravity, and formulating the AdS/CFT
correspondence within a strict S-matrix framework. The talk will be as
little technical as possible.
