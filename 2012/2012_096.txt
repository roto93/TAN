Time: 14:00-15:00
Location: NCU, S4-1013

Title: Direct Measurement of the CMB temperature anisotropy power spectrum from WMAP data
Abstract:
Angular power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature anisotropies
is one of the most important characteristics of the Universe which allows us to decide
its geometry and total density...etc. Using flat sky approximation and Fourier analysis,
we estimate the angular power spectrum from an ensemble of least foreground-contaminated
square patches from WMAP W and V frequency band map. This method circumvents the issue
of foreground cleaning and that of breaking orthogonality in spherical harmonic analysis
due to masking out the bright Galactic plane region, thereby rendering a direct
measurement of the angular power spectrum.

Title: Public Outreach at ASIAA
Abstract:
In order to engage with the general public, ASIAA started outreach effort as early as
2003, which is then expanded in 2010 in response to the recommendation in the Academia
Sinica 5-year Review. I will give an introduction of the public outreach effort at ASIAA.
