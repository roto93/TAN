  Title: Magnetizing the Intracluster Medium
          with AGN Feedback

  Tea/Discussion Time is followed in the same room.

                    All Welcome !!

ABSTRACT:
Galaxy clusters have been shown using Faraday rotation of background
radio sources to possess clusterwide magnetic fields of order 1-10
microGauss. These fields can have a variety of important effects on
diffusive transport processes in the intracluster medium, and they help
to accelerate nonthermal electrons that produce observable diffuse radio
emission. However, while plasma mechanisms operating during structure
formation readily produce very weak seed fields, how microGauss fields
come to exist throughout cluster-size volumes is not clear. Magnetized
feedback by the active galaxies known to exist at the centers of many
clusters has been suggested as a possible field amplification and
distribution mechanism. I will address this model using
magnetohydrodynamic simulations of AGN feedback in clusters.
