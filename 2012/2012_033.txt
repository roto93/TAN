Job Announcement: EACOA Fellowship 2012

The East Asian Core Observatories Association (EACOA) is an alliance of
four major astronomical research institutions in East Asia dedicated to
promote regional research cooperation. Member institutes of the EACOA are;
the National Astronomical Observatories, Chinese Academy of Science (NAOC),
the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ), Korean Astronomy and
Space Science Institute (KASI), and Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy
and Astrophysics (ASIAA). The EACOA announces an opportunity for highly
qualified individuals to apply for EACOA postdoctoral fellowships, starting
in 2012, to conduct research in all branches of astronomy and astrophysics.
Successful candidates will have an initial appointment of three years,
extendable for an additional two years (up to a total of 5 years), and are
expected to develop independent research programs as well as to integrate
with the existing activities at the EACOA member institutes. Fellows are
expected to work full-time on their research programs, and to be in
residence in at least two EACOA member Institutions during the period of
the Fellowship appointment.

Please see http://www-irc.mtk.nao.ac.jp/~fumi/EACOA-E/index.php?Fellow for
detailed information. The EACOA Fellowship is open to applicants of any
nationality, who have obtained their PhD in Astronomy or equivalent degree
in the related fields. For the year 2012 program, a monthly allowance of
US$5,000 will be paid as a fellowship award and relocation expenses will be
provided by the EACOA, through the NAOC. Also, research funds of ~US$20,000
/ year will be provided by the host institutes. In addition to these,
additional support for travel, etc. will be available.

Applications submitted before or on 31 March 2012 will receive full
consideration.

Applicants should submit their application documents and materials
electronically as specified in the application instructions. Applications
must include letters of endorsement from the host scientists confirming the
research project.

Up to three EACOA Fellowships will be awarded in 2012. The EACOA institutes
are actively committed to equal opportunity in employment.

*** Special Seminar
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:	Prof. Toshifumi Futamase (Tohoku Univ.)
Topic:		A New Approach to nonlinear evolution of cosmological density perturbation
Time:		2/16 (Thursday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:		 R1203
Abstract:
An accurate theoretical prediction of the density power spectrum has a
fundamental importance in the observational cosmology.
We have recently developed a new formalism to study this problem by
employing the Wiener-Hermite expansion technique. The calculated power
spectrum agrees with N-body result within 3% accuracy over the range
k=0.5-0.8 at z+0.5-3.0.

MEETING TITLE:
Cosmic Dust

WEBSITE:
https://www.cps-jp.org/~dust/

VENUE:
CPS (Center for Planetary Science), Kobe, JAPAN
https://www.cps-jp.org/access/

DATE:
August 6-10, 2012

OBJECTIVES:

This is the fifth meeting on Cosmic Dust. This series of Cosmic Dust
meetings aims at finding a consensus among experts on the formation
and evolution of cosmic dust: where it comes from and where it
goes. The meeting is organized by dust freaks who are very
enthusiastic not only to make the goal achievable but also to
establish a dust community across Asian and Oceanian countries for the
development of cosmic dust research worldwide. For this reason, the
primary objectives of the meeting are to bring together professionals
who deal with cosmic dust and to provide an opportunity for
participants to develop human relations and interactions between the
participants.

SCOPE:

All kinds of cosmic dust such as

• intergalactic dust
• interstellar dust
• protoplanetary disk dust
• debris disk dust
• cometary dust
• asteroidal dust
• interplanetary dust
• circumplanetary dust
• stellar nebular condensates
• presolar grains
• micrometeorites
• meteoroids
• meteors
• regolith particles

are the subject of discussion. The meeting is open for any aspects of
dust research by means of different methods of studies (in-situ and
laboratory measurements, astronomical observations, laboratory and
numerical analogue simulations, theoretical modeling, etc.). All
dust-related topics, for example, the formation of molecules and their
reactions on and their desorption from the surface of dust particles,
are also welcome. Publishing the proceedings of this meeting as a
special issue of a peer-reviewed journal is currently being planned,
while paper submission to the proceedings is not obligatory.

ADMISSIONS APPLICATION:

Please complete online meeting application at the CPS website in order
to attend the meeting. Because the number of participants shall be
limited, the online application does not guarantee admission to the
meeting. Participants will be determined at the discretion of the SOC
and all applicants will be notified of the admissions
decision. Priority will be given to those who contribute to oral or
poster sessions and retain enthusiasm for discussions throughout the
meeting. For further details, please visit the Cosmic Dust website.

IMPORTANT DATES:
13 May 2012, Deadline for Admissions Applications
31 May 2012, Notification of Admissions Decisions
6-10 August 2012, Cosmic Dust

BRIEF HISTORY:

The Cosmic Dust meeting started in 2006 as a session called “Cosmic
Dust” of the 3rd AOGS (Asia-Oceania Geoscience Society) annual
meeting in Singapore. Dust freaks have kept on organizing the session
at subsequent AOGS meetings in South Korea (2008), India (2010), and
Taiwan (2011). The Cosmic Dust series has been recognized as the most
successful session of the AOGS Planetary Sciences Section. In 2012,
the time is ripe for being free from organizing restrictions on the
AOGS meeting. Therefore, the fifth meeting of the Cosmic Dust series
becomes detached, totally independent of any international
conference. The past meetings on Cosmic Dust have been held in a
relaxed and joyful atmosphere. So will be the coming one!

Tetsuo, could you do the same to The Japanese Society for Planetary
Sciences? And could you also ask Takayuki Tanigawa to post it to
Taiwan Astronomy Network?
Akio, could you please circulate it to The Astronomical Society of Japan?
Keiko, could you do the same to Stardusters? And if you know someone
who could put our meeting into the LPI's meeting calendar, please ask.
Tetsuo and Sasha, could you also do the same to the participants in
your past meeting on Dust in Planetary Systems 2010?
Sasha and Conny, if you know any mailing list for German or European
communities of astronomy or related fields, please post it over such a
mailing list.
Aigen, if you know any mailing list for Chinese colleagues, please post it.
I will ask Canadian Astronomy Data Centre to put our meeting into
their calendar.
They will also announce it to American Astronomical Society,
International Astronomical Union, and NASA Astrophysics Data System.

Abstract: http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/activity/colloquium.php

*** Colloquium
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:	Cheng-Yu Kuo (ASIAA)
Topic:		The Megamaser Cosmology Project : Accurate Determination of the Hubble Constant and the Masses of the Supermassive Black Holes at the centers of Megamaser Galaxies
Time:		2/24 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:		 R1203
Abstract:
The primary goal of the Megamaser Cosmology Project is to determine the
Hubble constant H0  3\% accuracy in order to constrain the equation of state
parameter w of dark energy.  The key to achieving this goal is to measure
accurate distances to galaxies well into the Hubble flow (50 - 200
Mpc).  A proven method to measure accurate angular-diameter distances involves
sub-milliarcsecond resolution imaging of H2O maser emission from sub-parsec circumnuclear disks at the center of active galaxies, a technique established by the study of NGC 4258 with VLBI. As the Megamaser Cosmology Project discovers and images megamaser disks, an important result, in addition to the Hubble constant determination, is the accurate measurement of the masses of the supermassive black holes at the centers of these megamaser galaxies
In this talk, I will present the latest results on the Hubble constant
determination from the Megamaser Cosmology Project. In addition, I will also show the black hole mass measurements and their impact on our understanding of hte famous M-sigma relation.
