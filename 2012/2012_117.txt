Dear all, due to heavy rain and flooding, the following Special Colloquium at IANCU
(S4-Room 1013) has been postpone to 6/18:

Title: Star Shows: Planetariums, Science Showmen, and Astronomy Popularisation in
Nineteenth Century London
Speaker: Mr. Hsiang-Fu Huang (University College London)
Date: 2012-06-18
Time: 14:00-15:00
Location: NCU,  S4-1013
Abstract:

A long time ago in a city far, far away, a vibrant public science marketplace had
already formed. Nineteenth century Britain was a nation of show-keepers, and London was
the centre of this popular show culture. Various entertainments, exhibitions, and
theatres, competed against each other with the icing of knowledgeable instruction
related to different subjects. Astronomy was unexceptional. Many popular astronomical
lectures were delivered during this period; these astronomical lectures had different
styles, forms, and levels. Some of them were accompanied by magnificent visual aids,
such as the transparent orrery; some of them were more like a specialised discourse in a
learned institution. In this presentation, I will discuss a broad spectrum of popular
astronomy lecturing in nineteenth century London, especially emphasizing several
'unsung' lecturers -- they were once popular but are near-unknown today. This survey on
popular astronomical lecturers in nineteenth century Britain is my on-going
investigation. I expect this study will shed light on astronomy popularisation in the
past, and to inspire today's scientists and science educators.
