> Subject: [NRAO-Announcements] NRAO Proposal Preparation Webinar

Next Monday, June 11, the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) will 
broadcast a series of presentations designed to prepare the community for 
the upcoming ALMA (July 12) and Jansky VLA-GBT-VLBA (August 1) observing 
proposal deadlines. Each of these telescopes offers world-class 
capabilities, including significant new capabilities for the VLA and ALMA 
that are being offered for the first time at these deadlines.

The broadcast presentations will familiarize users with the process of 
proposing and the capabilities offered at these deadlines. Time for Q & A 
will be available for each facility. Participation will be via a 
combination of web-broadcast and dial-in audio. Registration is required 
so that we can distribute connection information.

We request that interested attendees register on-line by 8 pm Eastern Time 
this Friday, June 8.

To register and review the planned program schedule, visit:

Please feel free to forward this announcement to potentially interested 
parties. Those unfamiliar with NRAO telescopes are particularly encouraged 
to attend.

Dear all, upcoming Colloquium at IANCU (S4-Room 1013) is:

Title: Comparing RAVE data to the Besancon Galactic Model
Speaker: Dr. Andreas Ritter (IANCU)
Date: 2012-06-15
Time: 14:00-15:00
Location: NCU, S4-1013
Abstract:

The RAdial Velocity Experiment (RAVE, Steinmetz 2003) is an ongoing major spectroscopic
survey of the southern hemisphere. It offers the first truly representative inventory of
stellar radial velocities for all major components of the Galaxy, using the CaII triplet
region (8480--8740 Angstroms) to determine the radial velocities and stellar atmospheric
parameters like the effective temperature, surface gravity and metallicity of the
observed stars. The spectra are taken with the 6df multi-object spectrograph at the
UK-Schmidt telescope, situated at the Siding Spring Observatory in Australia. This
unique data set allows us for the first time to test the theoretical models of the
Galaxy for the whole southern hemisphere. I have developed a computational framework to
compare any large Galactic survey to Models of the Galaxy using statistical methods, and
the visualisation of the results. The application of this framework to the RAVE survey
and the Besancon Galactic Model (Robin 1986) reveals systematic discrepancies between
the measured and predicted parameter distributions, a different vertical metallicity
gradient, and a wealth of substructures (most of them new) in the Galaxy.

Dear All,
I'd like to bring to your attention three Faculty positions open at Queen's
http://jobregister.aas.org/job_view?JobID=42178

The AAS job register advertises two positions, but with staffing
rearrangements here this will almost certainly become three.

We are searching for high calibre candidates with outstanding
research records who are potential team leaders. Successful
candidates will be provided with resources to build and lead a
research team.

The deadline for applications is 6th July.
regards
Stephen

*** Colloquium
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Dr. Jean Coupon (ASIAA)
Topic:        New insights on galaxy evolution since z ~ 1.2 from the CFHT Legacy Survey
Time:        6/15 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
In the last few years, it is has become increasingly apparent that the mass of dark matter haloes in which galaxies reside is a key factor in regulating their formation and evolution. It is now evident that galaxies in low- and high-mass haloes experience very distinct fate. In this presentation, I will first explain why studying the relationship between stellar mass and halo mass brings valuable clues about physical processes involved in galaxy evolution. In the context of the halo model, the simple - but powerful - assumption that the number of galaxies only depends on halo mass, the halo occupation distribution (HOD) model, leads to an accurate analytic prediction of the galaxy distribution. Reciprocally, interpreting galaxy clustering using the HOD model allows to make a direct comparison between galaxy properties and halo mass. By using accurate galaxy clustering measurements over 133 deg2 of the “Wide” component of the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (!
CFHTLS), we performed a detailed investigation of the changing relationship between galaxies and the dark matter haloes they inhabit from z ~ 1.2. I will then pursue my talk with a presentation of this unique data set combining depth, large area and high image quality, and I will finally present our results and their implications for galaxy evolution.

> Subject: ALMA Proposal Writing Camp

Dear Potential ALMA users,

    As mentioned in the ALMA user workshop on June 9, the Taiwan ARC node
will host an ALMA Proposal Writing Camp, helping Taiwan users to sharpen and
polish their proposals to be submitted for Mock Review.  For the details of
the Mock Review, please visit the following website:
http://alma.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/proposals_cycle01.php#mock

    This camp will be hosted in Room 1203, Astronomy-Mathematics Building on
the NTU campus.  It will run from June 18 to 20 in the afternoon from 1 to 5
pm.  One to two ARC members will stay with the users, providing technical
advices.  The mock review panel members will standby and can be consulted
for science questions.

    In this camp, the users need to bring their own laptop that has the ALMA
softwares (e.g., OT and CASA) installed.  Also, in order to benefit from
this camp, the users should have their proposal draft ready as much as
possible.

    We encourage all potential ALMA users to attend this camp. Please let 
Pei-Ying (pyhsieh@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw) know by 3pm of June 15 whether or not 
you can attend this camp.  Also, please let her know if you need an English 
editor.  We will hire one if needed.

Best Wishes,
Chin-Fei
On behalf of the Taiwan ARC node

Dear all, due to heavy rain and flooding, the following Special Colloquium at IANCU
(S4-Room 1013) has been postpone to 6/18:

Title: Star Shows: Planetariums, Science Showmen, and Astronomy Popularisation in
Nineteenth Century London
Speaker: Mr. Hsiang-Fu Huang (University College London)
Date: 2012-06-18
Time: 14:00-15:00
Location: NCU,  S4-1013
Abstract:

A long time ago in a city far, far away, a vibrant public science marketplace had
already formed. Nineteenth century Britain was a nation of show-keepers, and London was
the centre of this popular show culture. Various entertainments, exhibitions, and
theatres, competed against each other with the icing of knowledgeable instruction
related to different subjects. Astronomy was unexceptional. Many popular astronomical
lectures were delivered during this period; these astronomical lectures had different
styles, forms, and levels. Some of them were accompanied by magnificent visual aids,
such as the transparent orrery; some of them were more like a specialised discourse in a
learned institution. In this presentation, I will discuss a broad spectrum of popular
astronomy lecturing in nineteenth century London, especially emphasizing several
'unsung' lecturers -- they were once popular but are near-unknown today. This survey on
popular astronomical lecturers in nineteenth century Britain is my on-going
investigation. I expect this study will shed light on astronomy popularisation in the
past, and to inspire today's scientists and science educators.
