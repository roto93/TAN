Dear all, below is the information for upcoming colloquium at IANCU:

Title: Suzaku Observations of Radio lobes in Active Galaxies
Speaker: Dr. Hiromi Seta (Saitama University/Rikkyo University)
Date: 2012-03-09
Time: 14:00-15:00
Location: NCU, S4-1013
Abstract:

The jet from active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is one of the most gigantic features of
energy concentration and release in the universe. At the center of AGNs lies a super
massive black hole, which powers the jet fueled by mass accretion. The jet with a
relativistic velocity releases a massive amount of energy in the intergalactic medium
such as radio lobes. The radio lobes accumulate energy and materials transported by the
jets for a long time. The radio lobes are thus a probe to estimate the amount of energy
emitted by the jet. However, because the emission from the lobes is diffuse and faint,
it is difficult to observe in the X-rays. We present the results of the Suzaku
observations of radio lobes of active galaxies. The Suzaku is Japan's X-ray satellite.
One of the characteristic features of Suzaku is low background due to the lower orbit
compared with other X-ray satellite. Thus Suzaku is good at observing diffuse and
obsolete emission such as that from radio lobes. The highlights of the results are (1)
the detection of high energy emission from the lobe, (2) the estimation of the evolution
of the jet, and (3) the detection of thermal emission from the lobe.
