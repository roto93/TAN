*** Colloquium
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:	Dr. Masahiko Kimura (Univ. of Tokyo/ASIAA)
Topic:		Instruments of the prime focus on the Subaru telescope
Time:		5/18 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:		 R1203
Abstract:
The prime focus of the telescope has a small number of the focal 
ratio and a wide field of view, suitable for the survey observations.
The Subaru Telescope is one of the two 8-meter class telescopes 
in the world with the ability to mount an instrument at prime focus. I talk the four instruments (Suprime-Cam, FMOS, HSC and PFS) of 
the prime focus with the Subaru telescope.
In these instruments, I have developed the Suprime-Cam and FMOS. 
I participate in development of PFS by ASIAA from April. 
I will talk about these instrument.

Topic:		Probing the Edge of the Universe from the Edge of the Earth: Searching for Cosmic Neutrinos at South Pole
Time:		5/15 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:30
Place:		 R104, NTU Condensed Matter Building
Abstract:
This year (2012) marks the centenary of Victor Hess’s historical discovery of cosmic rays. Over the 100 years’ time, scientists further realized that the universe is filled with all sorts of elementary particles. By investigating these cosmic particles, we can gain knowledge about the universe that is complementary to what offered by the more traditional optical telescopes. Neutrinos is known to interact very weakly with other particles and therefore can travel across the entire universe freely. A neutrino telescope can therefore in principle help to probe into the deepest of the universe, which also corresponds to looking back to its earliest history. However since neutrino is weakly interacting, it requires a large target to intercept when it arrive to Earth. With its huge volume of pristine ice, Antarctica is an ideal place for building such neutrino telescopes. The Askaryan Radio Array (ARA) Neutrino Observatory is one of such attempts. When completed in 4-5 years, i!
 t will cover 100 km^2 in area, to become the largest neutrino telescope in the world. Taiwan has been playing a key role in the inception and the construction of the ARA project. This is Republic of China's first major scientific project at the South Pole in its 100 years of history. In this lecture, we will introduce the science and technology of ARA and share with the audience the photos and videos taken at the South Pole in December 2011.
