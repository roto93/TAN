Dear Yi-Jehng: 

  Could you help to post this on TAN? Thanks! 

ngCFHT Workshop 
27-29 March 2013, Hilo, Hawaii 

First Announcement, October 2012 

A large number of wide-field photometric and astrometric surveys that 
are either underway, or planned for the coming decade, will soon map 
much the sky at a range of wavelengths. However, a gap in 
optical-infrared capabilities has emerged: there is an urgent need for 
complementary spectroscopic observations that can maximize the 
scientific return from these rich datasets and enable independent 
scientific programs that require large amounts of telescope time. 

There are number of wide-field spectroscopic instruments being 
commissioned or proposed on 4m-class facilities, as well as 
observational campaigns on existing 10m-class telescopes using current 
(ESO-GAIA) or planned (Subaru/PFS) facility instruments. To date, 
however, there is no dedicated, 10m-class, wide field telescope 
capable of conducting large spectroscopic surveys of faint targets 
(1E3 -1E7 with g>19) at a range of spectral resolutions (R ~ 2,000 to 
>=20,000), over large areas (1 - 10,000 square degrees). Such a 
capability is the natural complement to the large photometric studies 
of the next decade, and will provide the key data required for science 
areas as diverse as the mapping of the interstellar medium, stellar 
astrophysics, near field cosmology and Gaia follow-up, extragalactic 
astronomy, and the nature of dark matter and dark energy. 

The Next Generation CFHT is a proposal to replace the current 3.6m 
telescope with a wide-field 10m facility using the same pier and 
within the same three-dimensional envelope as the current telescope. 
The baseline for this facility is that it will be equipped with a 
dedicated multi-object spectrograph capable of obtaining more than 
3,000 spectra simultaneously over a 1.5 square degree field of view at 
spectral resolutions spanning from R=2,000 to at least R=20,000. 
Developing such a facility requires establishing a new and expanded 
partnership. To this end, a team of more than 60 scientists and 
engineers from ten countries have been defining the science cases and 
capabilities required for such a facility, and have investigated key 
technical challenges in the construction of the telescope and 
spectrographs. 

This workshop is intended as a forum for discussion of the science 
cases and technical status that has emerged from the feasibility 
study. It will last for 2.5 days, with summary talks discussing the 
science drivers and current technical status. Contributed talks and 
posters are encouraged to highlight synergies with current and future 
facilities and to propose opportunities for subsequent development. A 
large amount of time will be made available for discussion. This will 
be a key opportunity to define a strategic roadmap for the scientific 
and technical development of the project, and establish a foundation 
for the growth of the new partnership that will deliver this unique 
scientific facility to the international community. 

Venue capacity limits the number of attendees. At this time, it is 
encouraged for those interested in attending this workshop to complete 
the form on the website stating your intent to participate. Full 
registration and abstract submission will be available at a later 
time. Please check the website regularly for details and updates on 
the workshop in general.
