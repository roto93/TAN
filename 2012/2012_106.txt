Dear all, upcoming Special Colloquium at IANCU (S4-Room 1013) is:

Title:  Star Shows: Planetariums, Science Showmen, and Astronomy Popularisation in 
Nineteenth Century London
Speaker: Dr. Hsiang-Fu Huang (University College London)
Date: 2012-06-12
Time: 11:00-12:00
Location: NCU, S4-1013
Abstract:

A long time ago in a city far, far away, a vibrant public science marketplace had 
already formed. Nineteenth century Britain was a nation of show-keepers, and London was 
the centre of this popular show culture. Various entertainments, exhibitions, and 
theatres, competed against each other with the icing of knowledgeable instruction 
related to different subjects. Astronomy was unexceptional. Many popular astronomical 
lectures were delivered during this period; these astronomical lectures had different 
styles, forms, and levels. Some of them were accompanied by magnificent visual aids, 
such as the transparent orrery; some of them were more like a specialised discourse in a 
learned institution. In this presentation, I will discuss a broad spectrum of popular 
astronomy lecturing in nineteenth century London, especially emphasizing several 
'unsung' lecturers -- they were once popular but are near-unknown today. This survey on 
popular astronomical lecturers in nineteenth century Britain is my on-going 
investigation. I expect this study will shed light on astronomy popularisation in the 
past, and to inspire today's scientists and science educators.
