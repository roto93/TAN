Dear Colleagues,

You are cordially invited to attend the Joint Colloquium
which will be held on December 25.
The Joint Colloquium Series is organized by
the NTU Physics Department, Center for Condensed Matter Science (CCMS),
Leung Center for Cosmology and Particle Astrophysics (LeCosPA),
Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA),
and the Institute of Atomic and Molecular Sciences (IAMS).
The idea is to have excellent speakers to give inspiring, informative,
but non-technical talks on the frontiers of Sciences.

Enclosed below is the information of the Joint Colloquium on December 25.

Best regards,

Pisin Chen (LeCosPA)
Ting-Wai Chiu (NTU-Phys)
Michitoshi Hayashi (CCMS)
Lain-Jong Li (IAMS)
Michihiro Takami (ASIAA)

ASIAA/CCMS/IAMS/LeCosPA/NTU-Physics Joint Colloquium
Speaker: Prof. Martin L. Green
        ( Group Leader, Functional Properties Group, Materials  
Measurement Laboratory,
          National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), USA )
Topic: Materials for Sustainable Development.
Time : 12/25 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:10
Place: Room 104, CCMS-New Physics Building

Brief Bio. :
  Professor Martin L. Green is the leader of the Functional  
Properties Group of the Materials Measurement Laboratory at the  
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). His group  
incorporates experimental as well as computational approaches for  
understanding the fundamental properties of functional materials. He  
has B.S. and M.S. degrees in Metallurgy from the Polytechnic Institute  
of Brooklyn, and a Ph.D. in Materials Science from M.I.T. Dr. Green  
served as president of the Materials Research Society (MRS) in 2001,  
and is an MRS Fellow.


Abstract :
  Every human endeavor should be informed by sustainable development,  
because none of our material resources are infinite and only a few  
sources of energy are sustainable. The most common definition of  
sustainable development comes from the 1987 Brundtland report, “Our  
Common Future”, and states that “Sustainable development is  
development that meets the needs of the present without compromising  
the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.” However,  
this is not a scientific definition, and essentially refers to  
economic development.  Further, it requires that we know, or at least  
accurately estimate, what the needs of future generations will be. In  
this talk I will address the meaning and definition of sustainable  
development, and explore the space at its intersection with materials  
science. Materials have always served the role of technology enablers,  
and will continue to do so for sustainable development.  The immediate  
and direct connections between sustainable development and materials  
science include efficient use of materials (conservation,  
substitution, reuse, repurposing, recycling), materials life cycle  
assessment, replacement materials (scarcity, resource availability,  
materials flow analysis and economics), energy (materials to support  
alternative energy technologies, to mitigate problems with fossil-fuel  
technologies, and to increase energy efficiency), mitigation of  
undesirable impacts on environment and human health from technology  
and economic growth (corrosion, pollution, toxic waste), and water  
purification. I will also highlight a few examples of materials for  
sustainable development in research programs at NIST and elsewhere,  
such as materials for carbon capture, thermoelectric devices, and  
standards for bio-derived products.
