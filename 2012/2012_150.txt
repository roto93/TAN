Arizona Radio Observatory: Call for Proposals (Fall 2012)
------------------------------------------------------------
Dear Astronomers in Taiwan,

Proposals are being solicited, from members of the University Consortium of
ALMA-Taiwan and ASIAA, for observing time for the period October 1, 2012 - 
February 1, 2013, at the Arizona Radio Observatory, for the Sub-Millimeter
Telescope (SMT) and the Kitt Peak 12 Meter (KP12M). The proposal deadline of
UCAT/ASIAA for this 2012 fall semester is set on September 19, 2012 (Wednesday).

The SMT currently supports a dual-polarization, 1 mm receiver with ALMA Band-6
sideband-separating mixers, a dual-polarization 0.8 mm receiver, and a 0.4 mm
(602-720 GHz) dual-polarization receiver with ALMA Band-9 mixers. The SMT
control system has been updated to allow for dual polarization, dual sideband
observations (so-called "4 IF mode"). The KP12M supports a dual-polarization
3 mm receivers (82-116 GHz) that employs ALMA Band-3 sideboard-separating
mixers, as well as dual polarization, single sideband receivers for the lower
part of the 3 mm window (65-86 GHz) and at 2 mm (130-180 GHz). Remote observing
is available at both ARO telescopes. Please refer to http://aro.as.arizona.edu/
for more details.

Information about Remote Observing can be viewed at:
http://aro.as.arizona.edu/remote/remote.htm .
For further information about remote observing and other operational questions,
please contact Tom Folkers, Operations Manager: tfolkers@email.arizona.edu

Proposals should consist of:
1. A proposal Cover Sheet, obtainable at http://aro.as.arizona.edu/proposals.
2. A brief scientific and technical justification (no more than 2 pages).
3. A source list with observing time requirements and justification, and/or
  tables, figures and references (no more than 1 page in total).
4. provide the IP number of the computer you will be using during your observing
  time.

Please pay special attention to the "Sun avoidance" issue of your proposed
observations. The SMT will not be pointed to within 42 degrees of the Sun, and
the KP12M, 15 degrees.

Electronic submissions will be accepted in PDF format only. Scheduling of
successful proposals will be done according to availability of the receivers
requested. Please submit your proposals by midnight (23:59 pm CST) September 19,
2012 to: kuan AT asiaa.sinica.edu.tw .


Kind regards,
Yi-Jehng Kuan
on behalf of UCAT's ARO TAC

*** Special Seminar
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Kevin Walsh (Southwest Research Institute)
Topic:        The Grand Tack: Jupiter's migration to 1.5 AU, and how it shaped the inner solar system
Time:        8/23 (Thursday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
A persistent difficulty in terrestrial planet formation models is creating Mars analogs with the appropriate mass: Mars is typically an order of magnitude too large in simulations. A recent work found that a small Mars can be created if the planetesimal disk from which the planets form has an outermost edge at 1.0 AU. However, this work and no previous work, can explain such a truncation of the planetesimal disk and preserve the asteroid belt.  We show that gas-driven migration of Jupiter inward to 1.5 AU, before its subsequent outward migration, can truncate the disk and repopulate the asteroid belt. This dramatic migration history of Jupiter suggests that the dynamical behaviour of our giant planets was more similar to that inferred for extra-solar planets than previously thought, as both have been characterized by substantial radial migration.

Dear colleagues, 

It is to remind you that the deadline for 5th
EANAM (East Asian Numerical Astrophysics Meeting) is just around the
corner. Below are the details. Please register on time if you are
interested. If you remember, the biennial meeting was held in Taiwan
last time. This time the host is Japan. 

Thanks for your attention,


Pin-Gao Gu

Dear colleagues,

The deadline for EANAM
5th (Kyoto, Oct. 29-Nov.2) is approaching.
I would appreciate it if you
could remind your colleagues of the
deadline, AUGUST 31st.

You can
find the web page for the registration at


http://www2.yukawa.kyoto-u.ac.jp/ws/2012/eanam5/ [1]

The deadline is
for hotel accomodation, finanicial support and visa
as well as for
contributed papers. Although LOC has hotel rooms
available at this
moment, they will be released in early September
if we have vacancy. We
will offer the rooms on a first-come-first
-served basis.

As you know,
we have much time for contributed talks. If you find
good works by
nearby young posdocs and stundets, please encourage them
to
apply.

Yours,
Tomoyuki
