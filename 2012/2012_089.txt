------- Call For Scientific Presentations ------- 

The 23rd International CODATA Conference 

"Open Data and Information for a Changing Planet" 

October 28-31, 2012, Taipei 

http://www.codata2012.com/ 

Submission Deadline: June 15, 2012 
------------------------------------------------- 

BACKGROUND: 
Never before have scientific data and information played such a major 
role in addressing the problems and challenges facing our planet. 
The calls for freely available, publicly accessible data are gaining 
a stronger voice. Nurturing an open environment for data and information 
is crucial for disseminating research results to a wide audience and 
allowing thorough, collaborative analysis. 

The theme of the 23rd International CODATA Conference is "Open Data 
and Information for a Changing Planet". The conference will bring 
together stakeholders from industry, research and academia who will 
highlight, debate and address open data and information issues over 
a three day period. It will provide an international forum where 
these stakeholders, in collaboration with the ICSU and CODATA 
international networks and other networks, can create a dialogue on 
legal, economic, and technological challenges; evaluate societal 
impacts; and put forward possible solutions that can in turn benefit 
the planet. 

The CODATA International Conference is held once every two years, and 
is organized by CODATA (The Committee on Data for Science and Technology) 
under the auspices of ICSU (International Council for Science). The 
past three CODATA International Conferences were held in Beijing (2006), 
Kiev (2008), and Cape Town (2010). The 2012 CODATA International 
conference will be held in Taipei on October 28-31. 

SCIENTIFIC TOPICS: 
The conference is devoted to quality, reliability, management and 
accessibility of data for science and technology. Abstracts and 
Session Proposals are solicited on, but not limited to, the following 
topics: 

* e-Science and e-Science Networks
