Dear Colleagues,

The NTU Physics Department, Center for Condensed Matter Science, Institute
of Atomic and Molecular Sciences, the Academia Sinica Institute of
Astronomy and Astrophysics, and Leung Center for Cosmology and Particle
Astrophysics invite everyone to our joint colloquium series. The speakers
are all famous international scholars and the colloquia are aiming at a
broad audience, including undergraduate students. Below is the information
of the talk on May 15(Tuesday). Please help to forward this to the
colleagues in your departments.

Best Regards,
Chih-Wei Chang (CCMS)
Pisin Chen (LeCosPA)
Yee Hsiung (NTU Physics)
Yu-Ju Lin (IAMS)
Michihiro Takami (ASIAA)

 Topic: Probing the Edge of the Universe from the Edge of the Earth:
Searching for Cosmic Neutrinos at South Pole
Time: 05/15 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:30
Place: Chin-Pao Yang Lecture Hall (r104), CCMS-New Physics Building

Abstract:
This year (2012) marks the centenary of Victor Hess=92s historical discover=
y
of cosmic rays. Over the 100 years=92 time, scientists further realized tha=
t
the universe is filled with all sorts of elementary particles. By
investigating these cosmic particles, we can gain knowledge about the
universe that is complementary to what offered by the more traditional
optical telescopes. Neutrinos is known to interact very weakly with other
particles and therefore can travel across the entire universe freely. A
neutrino telescope can therefore in principle help to probe into the
deepest of the universe, which also corresponds to looking back to its
earliest history. However since neutrino is weakly interacting, it requires
a large target to intercept when it arrive to Earth. With its huge volume
of pristine ice, Antarctica is an ideal place for building such neutrino
telescopes. The Askaryan Radio Array (ARA) Neutrino Observatory is one of
such attempts. When completed in 4-5 years, it will cover 100 km^2 in area,
to become the largest neutrino telescope in the world. Taiwan has been
playing a key role in the inception and the construction of the ARA
project. This is Republic of China's first major scientific project at the
South Pole in its 100 years of history. In this lecture, we will introduce
the science and technology of ARA and share with the audience the photos
and videos taken at the South Pole in December 2011.


Brief Bio: Prof. Chen obtained his PhD from UCLA in theoretical particle
physics. He was elected APS Fellow in 1994. He is a two-time recipient of
the Gravity Research Foundation Essay Competition Awards (1995, 2001). In
2000 he initiated the Chen Institute for Particle Astrophysics and
Cosmology (later renamed Kavli Institute) at Stanford University. He
joined NTU in 2007 and has since been the director of the Leung Center for
Cosmology and Particle Astrophysics (LeCosPA) and the CC Leung University
Chair Professor of Cosmology. In addition to theoretical studies, he also
works on experiments. In 2000 he led a team at Stanford to demonstrate the
plasma focusing of high energy particle beams, a theoretical prediction
proposed by himself in 1987. He is currently the International
Co-Spokesperson of the ARA Cosmic Neutrino Observatory at South Pole. He is
a Founding Member of the Geneva-based World Education Council.
