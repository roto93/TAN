Dear all,

Some of you may notice from the IAA/TIARA homepage that we will have
TIARA Workshop on

  "Star Formation and Its Environment in the Center of Galaxies"
    November 12-16, 2012 (~1.5 weeks later)
    at TIARA in National Tsing Hua University (NTHU) in Hsinchu.

  https://www.tiara.sinica.edu.tw/activities/workshop/20121112/

As you can see in the program, we will have many forefront astronomers
in this field.  We do not have any registration, so if you are
interested in, please feel free to come, although the TIARA office is
small, so there will be a space limitation if there are too many people.

Thank you,
Satoki Matsushita
On behalf of the Organizing Committee
