Topic:        The role of anti-freeze compounds in maintaining subsurface oceans  in icy moons' interiors

Place:        R1203
Abstract:
A key parameter that controls the crystalization of primordial oceans in large icy moons is the presence of anti-freeze compounds. The phase diagram of the water-ammonia system is well documented, and several studies showed that the presence of a few wt% of ammonia in the primordial oceans of icy moons may stop the crystalization of these oceans. Another anti-freeze compound that may be present in Titan's interior is methanol. Using a thermodynamic model of the solar nebula and assuming a plausible composition of its initial gas phase, we first calculate the condensation sequence of ices in Saturn's feeding zone, and show that in Titan's building blocks methanol can have a mass fraction of ~4 wt% relative to water, i.e., methanol can be up to four times more abundant than ammonia. We then combine available data on the phase diagram of the water-methanol system and scaling laws derived from thermal convection to estimate the influence of methanol on the dynamics of the outer !
ice I shell and on the heat transfer through this layer. Our results indicate that a small fraction of methanol, which is consistent with the determination of Titan's building blocks composition, strongly reduces the vigor of convection in the outer ice shell. The effect of 5 wt% methanol is equivalent to that of 3 wt% ammonia. Thus, if methanol is present in the primordial ocean of Titan, the crystallization may stop, and a sub-surface ocean may be maintained between the ice I and high pressure ice layers. A preliminary estimate indicates that the presence of 4 wt% methanol and 1 wt% ammonia may result in an ocean at least 90 km thick.
