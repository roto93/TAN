Dear all, below is the information for upcoming colloquium at IANCU:

Title: Superluminous Supernovae
Speaker: Dr. Robert Quimby (IPMU)
Date: 2012-03-23
Time: 14:00-15:00
Location: NCU, S4-1013
Abstract

Not long ago the sample of well studied supernovae, which were gathered mostly through
targeted surveys, was populated exclusively by events with absolute peak magnitudes
fainter than about -20. Modern searches that select supernovae not just from massive
hosts but from dwarfs as well have produced a new census with a surprising difference: a
significant percentage of supernovae found in these flux limited surveys peak at -21
magnitude or brighter. The energy emitted by these superluminous supernovae in optical
light alone rivals the total explosion energy available to typical core collapse
supernovae (>10^51 ergs). This makes superluminous supernovae difficult to explain
through standard models. Adding further complexity to this picture are the distinct
observational properties of various superluminous supernovae. Some may be powered in
part by interactions with a hydrogen-rich, circumstellar material but others appear to
lack hydrogen altogether. Some appear to be powered by large stores of radioactive
material, while others fade quickly and have stringent limits on 56-Ni production. In
this talk I will discuss the current observational constrains on superluminous supernova
and the prospects for revealing their origins.
