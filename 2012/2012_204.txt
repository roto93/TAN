Dear Everyone:

    I wish to inform you that the first lecture would start on November 
15, 4:30 pm. (In fact, Halzen's colloquium would be given at 2:20 pm at 
Auditorium 204. Yes, it is the famous Halzen.) Tung-Mow is the famous Yan 
in Drell-Yan processes. Sincerely yours, Pauchy

Dear Pauchy,

Thanks for your understanding. New Jersey was the hardest hit, so Newark 
airport needs more time to repair its damage. I tried to ask the airline 
to book a different route, say from Syracuse, but they could not find 
anything for me.    

After the first week, I will discuss with you how to schedule two lectures 
in a week. Is the same room available for two lectures a week on different 
days? We can talk about this when I finally arrive.  

This is the first time I have so much trouble for my trips to Taiwan. I 
hope it will not happen again.
