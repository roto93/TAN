> Subject: New ALMA Science Verification data release 

Dear ALMA users,

A new installment of Science Verification data is planned for release on 
26 October 2012. The datasets that will be included in this release 
correspond to targets suggested by the community and listed in Table 2 of 
the Science Verification web page.

The release will include the following Science Verification datasets:

- The protoplanetary disk HD163296: multiple spectral lines, demonstrating 
the mixed modes capability, at Bands 6 and 7

- The Galactic Centre, Sgr A*: recombination lines at Band 3

Future science verification releases will also be preceded by a similar 
announcement.

Edwige from the Taiwan ARC node contributed Band 6 of HD163296 work.

Best Regards,
Chin-Fei
On behalf of Taiwan ARC node
