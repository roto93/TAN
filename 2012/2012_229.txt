Dear Colleagues,

You are cordially invited to attend the Joint Colloquium
which will be held on December 04.
The Joint Colloquium Series is organized by
the NTU Physics Department, Center for Condensed Matter Science (CCMS),
Leung Center for Cosmology and Particle Astrophysics (LeCosPA),
Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA),
and the Institute of Atomic and Molecular Sciences (IAMS).
The idea is to have excellent speakers to give inspiring, informative,
but non-technical talks on the frontiers of Sciences.

Enclosed below is the information of the Joint Colloquium on December 04.

Best regards,

Pisin Chen (LeCosPA)
Ting-Wai Chiu (NTU-Phys)
Michitoshi Hayashi (CCMS)
Lain-Jong Li (IAMS)
Michihiro Takami (ASIAA)

Abstract :
    Since ancient times not only scientists and philosophers but also  
the general public have been interested in how the nature works. In  
this colloquium we will trace the experimental observations and  
theoretical developments that shape our understanding  of natural  
phenomena. We now know that the fundamental constituents of matter are  
quarks and leptons. We may ask the question: could one anticipate the  
existence of these constituents well before their experimental  
discoveries?  At first glance, the answer seems to be yes. According  
to the equipartition theorem we learned in elementary statistical  
mechanics, each degree of freedom contributes (1/2)kT to the total  
energy of unit mass. Thus, it appears that by a simple measurement of  
its specific heat, it will reveal all the degrees of freedom, and  
hence the existence of the basic constituents. Yet, no rational people  
believe this could be accomplished. This is known as Boltzman paradox.  
Its resolution came from quantum mechanics which states that energy  
levels are quantized and discrete. Therefore, at certain energy,  
degrees of freedom above that energy will be frozen and are  
unobservable. When quantum mechanics and special relativity are  
combined, we are automatically led to quantum field theory. Every  
reasonable quantum field theory Is only an effective theory which  
requires a cutoff to signify the  energy scale of its applicability.  
For example, QED cutoff is about the electron mass or a few MeV, and  
electroweak interactions cutoff is about 100GeV. These cutoffs at  
different stages correspond to the resolving power required for the  
experiments to study the details at that energy scale. A key question  
facing the high energy particle physicists is whether there is another  
new scale for physics beyond the standard model, or there is a vast  
desert between TeV scale and Planck scale when gravity becomes  
important.  Finally we discuss why we care about this long quest for  
the laws of nature. We will mention atomic bomb, nuclear power, GPS,  
MRI, Laser, Internet and others to show how basic sciences have  
unintended consequences, good or bad, that altered dramatically our  
daily lives.
