Dear Colleagues,

You are cordially invited to attend the Joint Colloquium
which will be held on September 25 (next Tuesday).
The Joint Colloquium Series is organized by
the NTU Physics Department, Center for Condensed Matter Science (CCMS),
Leung Center for Cosmology and Particle Astrophysics (LeCosPA),
Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA),
and the Institute of Atomic and Molecular Sciences (IAMS).
The idea is to have excellent speakers to give inspiring, informative,
but non-technical talks on the frontiers of Sciences.

Enclosed below is the information of the Joint Colloquium on September  
25. Moreover, we would like to draw your attention to two special  
colloquiums
to be held after the Joint Colloquium, on the related subject.
Please help to forward this to the colleagues in your departments.

Best regards,

Pisin Chen (LeCosPA)
Ting-Wai Chiu (NTU-Phys)
Michitoshi Hayashi (CCMS)
Lain-Jong Li (IAMS)
Michihiro Takami (ASIAA)

Colloquium
Speaker: Prof. Sachio Komamiya (Tokyo U.)
Topic: History of Particle Physics and Linear Collider
Time: 09/25 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:10
Place: Room 104, CCM-New Physics Building

Abstract:
A new particle which is compatible with a Higgs boson is discovered in  
July this year with LHC at CERN. Detailed research of Higgs boson  
opens a new window to particle physics beyond the Standard Model. The  
Japanese community of high energy physics endorsed a final report of  
subcommittee of future projects. The highest priority is to the  
International e+e- linear collider (ILC) project.. The Technical  
Design Report of ILC will be completed in the end of this year. Two  
Japanese candidate sites of ILC are under study with official funding.  
Considering the above facts, now it is time to present importance and  
strategy of ILC as a possible globel project hosted by Japan. After a  
brief presentation of history and unsolved questions in particle  
physics, ILC project will be presented.

Colloquium-1
Speaker: Prof. Akira Yamamoto (KEK)
Topic: ILC Accelerator R&D
        --- Progress and prospect for the SCRF technology to realize ILC
Time: 09/25 (Tuesday) 15:15 - 15:40
Place: Room 104, CCM-New Physics Building

Abstract:
The International Linear Collider is anticipated to be the next  
energy-frontier electron-positron accelerator based on superconducting  
radio-frequency (SCRF) technology, and to accelerate electron and  
positron beams up to 250 GeV each (500 GeV cms in collision) with  
having extend-ability up to 500 GeV each 1 TeV cms).
In this seminar, we report status of the technical design and R&D  
efforts carried out in the Technical Design phase since 2007, and  
discusses further plans after completion of the Technical Design  
Report (TDR) in 2012.

Brief Bio:
Akira Yamamoto received his PhD from University of Tokyo, 1983, based  
on his research work "Study of intense kaon beam at the KEK 12 GeV  
proton synchrotron". He has been working, for many years, in the field  
of applied superconductivity for particle physics and accelerators,  
including his particular contribution to the LHC beam interaction  
region superconducting magnets and the Central Solenoid for the ATLAS  
experiment. Recently he has been contributing to the development of  
superconducting RF technology for the International Linear Collider  
project in the context of its realization via a global cooperation, as  
one of three Project Managers for ILC Global Design Effort.

Colloquium-2
Speaker: Dr. Tomohiko Tanabe (Tokyo U.)
Topic: ILC Detector R&D
Time: 09/25 (Tuesday) 15:40-16:05
Place: Room 104, CCM-New Physics Building

Abstract:
The detector design for the International Linear Collider employs  
state-of-art technology to provide unprecedented precision in the  
measurements of particles and jets, which are crucial for the studies  
of the Higgs boson and physics beyond the Standard Model.
In this talk, the key detector components are discussed, along with  
the key idea of the particle flow approach to the jet energy  
measurement.  The talk will primarily focus on the International Large  
Detector concept.

Brief Bio:
Tomohiko Tanabe received his Ph.D. in 2009 from the University of  
California in Berkeley.  He currently holds a postdoctoral position at  
the University of Tokyo.
His research focuses on the precision physics program at the  
International Linear Collider.  He co-leads the detector optimization  
effort for the International Large Detector concept.
