Speaker:    Dr. Ray Furuya (NAOJ/Subaru Telescope)
Topic:        The Initial Conditions for Gravitational Collapse of Star-Forming Molecular Cloud Core
Time:        1/19 (Thursday) 16:00 - 17:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
Without accurate knowledge of the initial conditions of gravitational collapsing process 
of a molecular cloud core, one cannot understand how a low-mass protostar forms. 
One of the major limiting factors is that the initial conditions of core collapse are not 
necessarily revealed by observations in detail. In this context, we performed a study of 
the natal molecular cloud core and its environment. The core is believed to harbor an 
extremely young low-mass protostar that has not generated an extensive molecular outflow, 
yielding a rare opportunity to investigate core-collapsing process free from the disturbance 
by the outflow. Our observations suggest that the gas in the molecular cloud core is infalling
onto the protostar, and that the non-thermal velocity dispersions, tracing the ambient 
turbulent velocity fields, in the medium-density gas are clearly smaller than those in 
the low-density gas. We discuss these results with comparisons of theoretical models 
and the implications for initial conditions of star formation in general.

** SOUNDBITE: **

Knowing the distance of an astrophysical object is key to
understanding it. However, at present, comparisons of theory and
observations are hampered by precision (or lack thereof) in distance
measurements or estimates. Putting the many recent results and new
developments in relevant subareas into the broader context of the
physics driving cosmic distance determination is the next logical
step, which will benefit from the combined efforts of theorists,
observers and modellers working on a large variety of spatial scales,
and spanning a wide range of expertise. This Symposium will focus on
the physics underlying methods of distance determinations across the
Universe, exploring on the way the various methods employed to define
the milestones along the road. We aim to provide a snapshot of the
field of distance measurement, offering not only up-to-date results
and a cutting-edge account of recent progress, but also full
discussion of the pitfalls encountered and the uncertainties that
remain. We aim to provide a roadmap for future efforts in this field,
both theoretically and observationally.

** SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE: **

Knowing the distance of an astrophysical object is key to
understanding it: without an accurate distance we do not know how
bright it is, how large it is, or even (for long distances) when it
existed. But astronomical distance measurement is a challenging
task. Distances to stars were first measured in 1838 by Bessel, Struve
and Henderson, and accurate distances to other galaxies -- even the
nearest -- date only from the 1950s. This is not really surprising,
since the only information we have about any object beyond our Solar
System is its position (perhaps as a function of time) and its
brightness (as a function of wavelength and time). Yet, from this
unpromising starting point, modern astronomers have developed methods
of measuring distances which can take us from the nearest star to the
most distant galaxy, using techniques that vary from the mundane (the
astronomical equivalent of the surveyor's theodolite) to the exotic
(the bending of light in general relativity, wiggles in the spectrum
of the cosmic microwave background). Nevertheless, the most accurate
optical and near-infrared methods of distance determination, from the
solar neighbourhood to the highest redshifts, in use today rely
heavily on having access to accurate spectroscopy, supplemented by
astrometric measurements in the Milky Way (and slightly beyond).

In 1997, the Hipparcos space mission provided (for the first time) a
significant number of absolute trigonometric parallaxes at
milliarcsec-level precision across the whole sky, which had a major
impact on all fields of astrophysics. In addition, during the past ten
years, the use of ground-based 8-10mclass optical and near-infrared
telescopes (Keck, VLT, Gemini, Subaru) and space observatories (HST,
Spitzer, Chandra, XMM-Newton) have provided an unprecedented wealth of
accurate photometric and spectroscopic data for stars and galaxies in
the local Universe. Radio observations, particularly with the VLBA and
the Japanese VERA arrays, have achieved 10 micro-arsecond astrometric
accuracy. Moreover, stellar models and numerical simulations are now
providing accurate predictions of a broad range of physical phenomena,
which can now in principle be tested using accurate spectroscopic and
astrometric observations (including measurements of, e.g., line ratios
and shapes, spectral slopes, radial velocities and velocity
dispersions). However, at present, comparisons of theory and
observations are mainly hampered by precision (or lack thereof) in
distance measurements/estimates.

While a number of past IAU Symposia have addressed individual aspects
of the methods and physics underlying the fundamentals of distance
determination, at the present time there is a need for a new,
interdisciplinary Symposium encompassing the broad range of techniques
and theories. Rather than focusing on historical perspectives, we will
truly highlight the tremendous amount of recent and continuing
research into a myriad of exciting and promising aspects of accurately
pinning down the cosmic distance scale. Putting the many recent
results and new developments in the relevant subareas into the broader
context of the physics driving cosmic distance determination is the
next logical step, which will benefit from the combined efforts of
theorists, observers and modellers working on a large variety of
spatial scales, and spanning a wide range of expertise.

This is a very exciting time. VLBI sensitivity is being expanded
allowing, for example, direct measurement of distances throughout the
Milky Way and even to Local Group galaxies. The field will benefit
from expert input to move forward into the era of Gaia,
optical-interferometer and ELT-driven science, which (for example)
will allow us to determine Coma-cluster distances without having to
rely on secondary distance indicators, thus finally making the leap to
accurate distance measurements well beyond the Local Group of
galaxies. With the launch of Gaia imminent at the time of the IAU GA
in Beijing, this is a really opportune time to be looking forward to
the first Gaia catalogues, and understand how the science areas
touched upon in this Symposium will be fundamentally changed by the
Gaia results, what the big open questions are that Gaia can address in
the Symposium's context, and what the future of complementary
techniques and observational approaches will be once the Gaia
catalogues become available.

In this Symposium, we will bring together experts on various aspects
of distance determinations and (most importantly) the underlying
physics enabling this (without being restrictive in areas where
statistical and observational approaches are more relevant), from the
solar neighbourhood to the edge of the Universe, exploring on the way
the various methods employed to define the milestones along the
road. We will emphasise, where possible, the physical bases of the
methods and recent advances made to further our physical insights. We
aim to provide a snapshot of the field of distance measurement,
offering not only up-to-date results and a cutting-edge account of
recent progress, but also full discussion of the pitfalls encountered
and the uncertainties that remain. We aim to provide a roadmap for
future efforts in this field, both theoretically and observationally,
and in particular will consider the key question as to whether the
field is best served by having access to the nextgeneration of
extremely large telescopes and the Square Kilometer Array (as well as
the James Webb Space Telescope) and/or if significant progress can
still be made with dedicated 2-4m-class optical telescopes as well as
upgraded radio interferometers.

Although our focus is techniques of distance determination, this is
intimately linked to many other aspects of astrophysics and
cosmology. On our journey from the solar neighbourhood to the edge of
the Universe, we shall encounter stars of all types, alone, in pairs
and in clusters, their life cycles, and their explosive ends: binary
stars, in particular, play an important role in this context, e.g. in
pinning down accurate distances to the Pleiades open cluster and Local
Group galaxies, as well as in future ground- and space-based surveys
(including Gaia, RAVE, and others); the stellar content, dynamics, and
evolution of galaxies and groups of galaxies; the gravitational
bending of starlight; and the expansion, geometry and history of the
Universe. As a result, the Symposium will offer not only a
comprehensive study of distance measurement, but a tour of many recent
and exciting advances in astrophysics.

> Subject: UK-Taiwan studentship funding opportunity

Dear Yi-Jehng, 

I am a Professor in the Department of Earth Science and Engineering at Imperial College London. I have just become aware of a funding opportunity for students from Taiwan to study at Imperial. The student should be nominated by a University in Taiwan and it could provide an opportunity to initiate collaboration between the UK and Taiwan. Details are below: 

http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/international/prospective/newscholarships/taiwanscholar 

If you have any Masters students that would like to work in the field of extraterrestrial organic matter, Life detection space missions or mass extinction studies that I would be very happy to support an application. 

Please get in touch if you need any more information. 

Best regards 

Mark

*** Colloquium
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Prof. Yasushi Suto (The University of Tokyo)
Topic:        Colors of a second Earth
Time:        2/3 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
We develop a simple method to estimate the fractional areas of
different surface types on earth-like exoplanets from multi-band
photometry. Our attempt is to reproduce the scattered light curves as
a sum of the 5 surface types, i.e., ocean, soil, vegetation, snow and
cloud. We would like to answer an ambitious, but well-defined,
scientific question: "If we discover an exoplanet identical to the
Earth in the near future, can we infer the presence of vegetation
observationally ?''. This is why we intentionally and specifically
adopt the major surface types of the Earth, including vegetation, into
the analysis even though our method is thus inevitably
model-dependent. We apply our method to mock scattered light curves of
the Earth and to the real data from the Earth observing satellite. In
an idealized situation where the photometric errors are only photon
shot noise, we are able to reproduce the fractional areas of those
components fairly well. We may be even able to detect a signature of
vegetation from the distinct feature of photosynthesis on the Earth,
known as the red edge. In our reconstruction method, Rayleigh
scattering due to the atmosphere has an important effect, and for
terrestrial exoplanets with atmosphere similar to our Earth, it is
possible to estimate the presence of oceans and an atmosphere
simultaneously.
