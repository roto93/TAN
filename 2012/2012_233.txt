Dear colleague,

This is to announce the opening of Call for Proposals
for the Lulin One-meter Telescope open use semester 2013A.
from 2013 February 1 through 2013 July 31.

  Proposal Deadline 23:59 December 29  2012

The Lulin One-meter Telescope (LOT) solicits observing proposals for the
semester of 2013A.  The new semester begins on 1 February 2013 and ends
on 31 July 2013.

Those interested in applying for observing time can download the
proposal LaTex package from the web page:

  http://eafon.astro.ncu.edu.tw/lulinprop/lotprop.tar.gz

The completed proposal should contain the filled and compiled version
of the LaTex file (in PDF or PS format), plus up to two PDF pages of
scientific justification including figures, tables, and references.
The proposal (cover form and 2-page of scientific case) should be
submitted to the following email address:

  lottac@eafon.astro.ncu.edu.tw

with a copy to me to avoid occasional erroneous delivery:

  urata@astro.ncu.edu.tw

Please note that in addition to research proposals, we also accept
educational programs for astronomical observation courses.
Time allocation will be announced by mid-January, 2013.

The Observatory management pays particular attention to the scientific
products by our facilities. So if you have used the LOT before, please
fill in the status of the data, and any publications as results of any
LOT data.  The publication list is summarized at

http://lulin.ncu.edu.tw/Research/index.htm

If you have any updates from your previous observations, please list
up the complete list.  If no information is forthcoming, the TAC will
assume that no progress has been made and will take this into
consideration in allocation of observing time.  If your program is
continuous one, please do NOT forget to mention about the status of
the project and publication plans.

As usual, there will be three instruments available, the Lulin CCD
Imager (LCI), the Lulin Compact Spectrograph (LCS), and TRIPOL, a
simultaneous tricolor (g', r', i') imaging polarimeter.  At the time
of this announcement, TRIPOL is being shaked down and characterized.
Those who are interested in the specs of any of these instrument
should contact Prof. Wen Ping Chen.  You can follow this url to get
information regarding the telescope and instruments,

To ensure the capabilities of LOT and instruments, you can also refer

If you have any questions or problems regarding the preparation of the
proposals, please contact
