------- Call For Scientific Presentations ------- 

The 23rd International CODATA Conference 

"Open Data and Information for a Changing Planet" 

October 28-31, 2012, Taipei 

http://www.codata2012.com/ 

Submission Deadline: June 15, 2012 
------------------------------------------------- 

BACKGROUND: 
Never before have scientific data and information played such a major 
role in addressing the problems and challenges facing our planet. 
The calls for freely available, publicly accessible data are gaining 
a stronger voice. Nurturing an open environment for data and information 
is crucial for disseminating research results to a wide audience and 
allowing thorough, collaborative analysis. 

The theme of the 23rd International CODATA Conference is "Open Data 
and Information for a Changing Planet". The conference will bring 
together stakeholders from industry, research and academia who will 
highlight, debate and address open data and information issues over 
a three day period. It will provide an international forum where 
these stakeholders, in collaboration with the ICSU and CODATA 
international networks and other networks, can create a dialogue on 
legal, economic, and technological challenges; evaluate societal 
impacts; and put forward possible solutions that can in turn benefit 
the planet. 

The CODATA International Conference is held once every two years, and 
is organized by CODATA (The Committee on Data for Science and Technology) 
under the auspices of ICSU (International Council for Science). The 
past three CODATA International Conferences were held in Beijing (2006), 
Kiev (2008), and Cape Town (2010). The 2012 CODATA International 
conference will be held in Taipei on October 28-31. 

SCIENTIFIC TOPICS: 
The conference is devoted to quality, reliability, management and 
accessibility of data for science and technology. Abstracts and 
Session Proposals are solicited on, but not limited to, the following 
topics: 

* e-Science and e-Science Networks 
* Information Science and Computational informatics 
* Data Mining and Knowledge Management 
* Interoperability and Data Integration 
* Earth and Environmental Data 
* Biological Science, Medical and Health Data 
* Physical Science Data 
* Social Science Data and the Digital Humanities 
* Open Access; Public Section Information; Legal and Policy Issues 
* Semantic Web and Linked Data 
* Data Challenges for Global Sustainability: The Outcome of Rio+20 

SUBMISSION INFORMATION: 
Submission deadline: June 15, 2012 (extended from May 25). 

Submissions can be made in two categories: Abstract and Session Proposal. 
They should be submitted electronically via the submission web page at 
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=codata2012 . Please visit 
the web site http://www.codata2012.com for details about abstract and 
session proposal submissions, and for more information about the conference.

First Circular EANAM 2012

The 5th East Asia Numerical Astrophysics Meeting
Oct. 29 -- Nov. 2, 2012, Yukawa Institute, Kyoto, Japan
http://www2.yukawa.kyoto-u.ac.jp/ws/2012/eanam5/index.html [2]

-----------------------------------------------------------

EANAM 2012 is the 5th meeting in the series of East Asia
Numerical Astrophysics (EANAM). EANAM has been held
bi-annually to stimulate numerical astrophysics in the
east Asia. Its scope encompasses research fields involving
numerical simulations of stars and planets on the small scale
to cosmological structures on the large scale. Topics will
include (but not limited to) the numerical astrophysics of
hydrodynamics, magnetohydrodynamics, radiative transfer,
particle acceleration, and numerical relativity. In addition,
there will also be a focus on computer science applications
directed toward astrophysics including numerical methods,
simulation data analysis, and high performance computing.
The program consists of tutorial lectures, invited talks,
contributed talks, and poster papers with brief oral
presentations. We welcome active postdocs and graduate students.

We call for contributed talks and posters. We encourage you to
register yourself at earliest convenience
through the conference web site,

  http://www2.yukawa.kyoto-u.ac.jp/ws/2012/eanam5/index.html [3]

We strongly recommend participants from outside Japan to
reserve a hotel room at earliest convenience. We have made
block reservation in several nearby hotels. However the
number of available rooms are limited. We will serve them
by the first come first served policy. Note that most
nearby hotels will be occupied by the end of summer since
the conference venue is close to many charming sight seeing
spots.

Financial Support:

A limited amount of financial support is available for those
who present either oral or poster papers. We give priority to
graduate students and young postdocs who do not have their
financial resources, according to the traditional policy in this
series of meetings. The financial support covers living expense
during the meeting not travel expense.

Accommodation:

Kyoto city has many hotels but most of them are fully occupied
during the meeting. We strongly recommend you to reserve your
rooms much in advance. Our web site gives you our recommendation
to you coming from abroad.

Important Dates:

Apr. 30 Opening of the registration
Aug. 31 Deadline for registration and visa application
Aug. 31 Deadline for abstract submission for contributed
  talks and poster papers
Sep. 30 Deadline for abstract submission for invited talks
Oct. 1 second circular (with science program)
Oct. 29 EANAM 2012

Registration Fee:
The registration fee is 10,000 JPN but 5,000 JPN for students.
This covers welcome reception (Oct. 29), conference dinner (Nov. 1),
and daily tea and coffee at breaks. We collect the registration
fee at the on site registration desk.

EANAM 2012 is sponsored by
Yukawa Institute for Theoretical Physics, Kyoto University
National Astronomical Observatory of Japan
HPCI Strategic Program Field 5

Further details are given at the conference web site.

 Topic: Probing the Edge of the Universe from the Edge of the Earth:
Searching for Cosmic Neutrinos at South Pole
Time: 05/15 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:30
Place: Chin-Pao Yang Lecture Hall (r104), CCMS-New Physics Building

Abstract:
This year (2012) marks the centenary of Victor Hess=92s historical discover=
y
of cosmic rays. Over the 100 years=92 time, scientists further realized tha=
t
the universe is filled with all sorts of elementary particles. By
investigating these cosmic particles, we can gain knowledge about the
universe that is complementary to what offered by the more traditional
optical telescopes. Neutrinos is known to interact very weakly with other
particles and therefore can travel across the entire universe freely. A
neutrino telescope can therefore in principle help to probe into the
deepest of the universe, which also corresponds to looking back to its
earliest history. However since neutrino is weakly interacting, it requires
a large target to intercept when it arrive to Earth. With its huge volume
of pristine ice, Antarctica is an ideal place for building such neutrino
telescopes. The Askaryan Radio Array (ARA) Neutrino Observatory is one of
such attempts. When completed in 4-5 years, it will cover 100 km^2 in area,
to become the largest neutrino telescope in the world. Taiwan has been
playing a key role in the inception and the construction of the ARA
project. This is Republic of China's first major scientific project at the
South Pole in its 100 years of history. In this lecture, we will introduce
the science and technology of ARA and share with the audience the photos
and videos taken at the South Pole in December 2011.


Brief Bio: Prof. Chen obtained his PhD from UCLA in theoretical particle
physics. He was elected APS Fellow in 1994. He is a two-time recipient of
the Gravity Research Foundation Essay Competition Awards (1995, 2001). In
2000 he initiated the Chen Institute for Particle Astrophysics and
Cosmology (later renamed Kavli Institute) at Stanford University. He
joined NTU in 2007 and has since been the director of the Leung Center for
Cosmology and Particle Astrophysics (LeCosPA) and the CC Leung University
Chair Professor of Cosmology. In addition to theoretical studies, he also
works on experiments. In 2000 he led a team at Stanford to demonstrate the
plasma focusing of high energy particle beams, a theoretical prediction
proposed by himself in 1987. He is currently the International
Co-Spokesperson of the ARA Cosmic Neutrino Observatory at South Pole. He is
a Founding Member of the Geneva-based World Education Council.
