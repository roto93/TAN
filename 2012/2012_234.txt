*** Special Seminar
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Julian Merten (Caltech/JPL)
Topic:        Creation of cosmic structure in clusters of galaxies
Time:        12/4 (Tuesday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
The widely accepted current standard model of cosmology predicts a hierarchical scenario of structure formation. Driven by small initial seed overdensities, structure collapses due to gravity and decouples from the Hubble flow. Through a subsequent sequence of mergers large and massive dark matter dominated halos form. The largest structures we observe today in this bottom-up scenario are clusters of galaxies and as the youngest structures to date, clusters are rendered as ideal laboratories to test our standard picture of structure formation. While observable in many different wavelength regimes, clusters reveal their mass components to the observerﾃ不 eye. In my talk I will present the latest results from the HST/MCT programme CLASH, which spends a significant amount of Hubble observing time on the study of a sample of 25 galaxy clusters. Properties like the dark matter density profile of halos can be determined to high precision and when used as cosmic telescopes, cluster!
s allow a peak at the very young Universe. Furthermore, I will present the latest results from the study of merging clusters of galaxies, like the Bullet and Pandoraﾃ不 Cluster. Those most energetic events in the Universe provide the unique opportunity to observe the different matter components of the Universe under extreme conditions and allow for the direct derivation of microscopical properties of dark matter. For this reason a Cluster Merger Collaboration (MC^2) has been created to study mergers in the context of alternative dark matter models. I will end in outlining this project.

  Title: Modeling Magnetic Fields in Protostellar Cores
        from Interferometeric Polarization Measurements

      Tea/Discussion Time is followed in the same room.
                  All Welcome !!

Abstract:
We compare high-angular resolution observations of submillimeter
dust polarization of NGC1333 IRAS 4A with empirical density and
magnetic field models in protostellar cores. With the assumptions of
constant dust property and small dust alignment efficiency, we compute
the Stokes I,Q, and U maps of the empirical models and convolve them with 
interferometer responses to generate polarization maps. The best-fit
density model is obtained with comparisons of modeled and observed Stokes 
I visibilities, and the goodness of magnetic field models is evaluated by 
the residuals between the polarization angles on the modeled and
observed maps. The effects of viewing angle are also tested in our 
simulations. Our results show that hourglass structures alone
cannot reproduce the depolarization effect in NGC1333 IRAS 4A if the 
inclination angle is indeed as small as what have been inferred
from the outflow line-of-sight velocity and proper motions. Our analysis 
suggests that the magnetic fields of NGC1333 IRAS 4A might have
an hourglass structure at scales of few hundred AU along with a smaller 
toroidal component around the protostars. The modified field geometry is 
in agreement with the theoretical expectation of rotating magnetized
collapsing cores.

Dear Prof. Kuan,

Would you please distribute this to TAN ?
Thank you very much.

---------- Forwarded message ----------

Dear colleague,

This is to announce the opening of Call for Proposals
for the Lulin One-meter Telescope open use semester 2013A.
from 2013 February 1 through 2013 July 31.

  Proposal Deadline 23:59 December 29  2012

The Lulin One-meter Telescope (LOT) solicits observing proposals for the
semester of 2013A.  The new semester begins on 1 February 2013 and ends
on 31 July 2013.

Those interested in applying for observing time can download the
proposal LaTex package from the web page:

  http://eafon.astro.ncu.edu.tw/lulinprop/lotprop.tar.gz

The completed proposal should contain the filled and compiled version
of the LaTex file (in PDF or PS format), plus up to two PDF pages of
scientific justification including figures, tables, and references.
The proposal (cover form and 2-page of scientific case) should be
submitted to the following email address:

  lottac@eafon.astro.ncu.edu.tw

with a copy to me to avoid occasional erroneous delivery:

  urata@astro.ncu.edu.tw

Please note that in addition to research proposals, we also accept
educational programs for astronomical observation courses.
Time allocation will be announced by mid-January, 2013.

The Observatory management pays particular attention to the scientific
products by our facilities. So if you have used the LOT before, please
fill in the status of the data, and any publications as results of any
LOT data.  The publication list is summarized at

http://lulin.ncu.edu.tw/Research/index.htm

If you have any updates from your previous observations, please list
up the complete list.  If no information is forthcoming, the TAC will
assume that no progress has been made and will take this into
consideration in allocation of observing time.  If your program is
continuous one, please do NOT forget to mention about the status of
the project and publication plans.

As usual, there will be three instruments available, the Lulin CCD
Imager (LCI), the Lulin Compact Spectrograph (LCS), and TRIPOL, a
simultaneous tricolor (g', r', i') imaging polarimeter.  At the time
of this announcement, TRIPOL is being shaked down and characterized.
Those who are interested in the specs of any of these instrument
should contact Prof. Wen Ping Chen.  You can follow this url to get
information regarding the telescope and instruments,

  http://www.lulin.ncu.edu.tw/lot/

To ensure the capabilities of LOT and instruments, you can also refer
the previous publications with LOT listed in the following URL.

If you have any questions or problems regarding the preparation of the
proposals, please contact
Instrumentation/Telescope/Instrumentation queries Mr. Hunag-Chin Lin
Scientific queries Yuji Urata

Yuji Urata
on behalf of the LOT Time Allocation Committee
