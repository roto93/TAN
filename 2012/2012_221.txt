*** Colloquium

Speaker:    Martin Kilbinger (CEA)
Topic:        Constraints on dark energy and modified gravity models from CFHTLenS
weak lensing
Time:        11/23 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
I present results from weak gravitational lensing by the large-scale structure
from CFHTLenS (Canada-France-Hawaii Lensing Survey). Using multi-band optical
data over 155 square degrees, we measure the weak lensing correlation of
high-redshift galaxies from small out to very large, linear scales. We
reconstruct the largest maps of dark matter ever made, and infer information on
cosmological parameters for flat and curved Lambda and dark-energy CDM models,
and modified gravity (the latter together with redshift-space distortions from
Wiggle-Z). In addition, by comparing the lensing observations with the light
distribution from galaxies, we measure the relation (bias and
cross-correlation) between total and luminous matter.

I will give an introduction to weak gravitational lensing and its use
in cosmology. I will present an overview over the CFHTLenS lensing analysis and
the likelihood and sampling methods (Population Monte Carlo, PMC). These
results will be put in a larger context of large on-going and planned ground-
and space-based galaxy surveys such as DES and Euclid.

See www.cfhtlens.org for links to the released data and more details.

Topic:        1.1-mm spectral line survey of EGOs -- similarity and randomness
Time:        11/20 (Tuesday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
We have performed a 1.1-mm spectral line survey to a sample of 89 GLIMPSE
extended green objects (EGOs) by using the SMT 10m. The survey covers
molecular line tracers of dense gas, hot gas and shocks. The indications
of the results will be discussed. Further combining this with our previous
observation of low density tracers, isotopic CO 1-0 lines toward the same
sample of EGOs, I will discuss the ubiquitous log-linear line luminosity
correlations among all the tracer lines and the data scatter.
I will try conclude that most of the EGO associated molecular clouds have
similarity in thermal and density structures and shock properties.
I will also try to demonstrate that the randomness in the cloud structure
and turbulence velocity field increases over larger ranges of cloud substructure
size scales or whole-cloud size scales.
