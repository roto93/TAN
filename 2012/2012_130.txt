> Subject: Reminders and Notes for ALMA Cycle 1 Proposal Call

Dear Potential ALMA users,

Here are some reminders and notes.

1. The deadline for ALMA Cycle 1 proposal call is July 12.

2. Once the proposal is validated within the OT, it can be submitted to the
ALMA Archive.  Note that the proposal can be resubmitted by the Principal
Investigator as many times as needed before the proposal deadline.

3. The English Editor, Lucy, will come to IAA from 1pm to 5pm on July 5 (RM
1023) and July 12 (RM 1108).  Please talk to her if you need any help
polishing your proposals.

4. On the ALMA-T website, we posted a trouble shooting page about the issues
of helpdesk, executive in OT, and incorrect time estimation in CASA 3.4 in
bands 9 and 10:

http://alma.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/proposals_trouble.php

We will update the page for any issues that you need to know for writing
your proposals

Best Wishes,
Chin-Fei
On behalf of T-ARC node

July 2013. The conference objectives are:

** **

**=D8              **To integrate information about this planet, its
satellites, and their context in the Kuiper Belt.

**=D8              **To encourage groundbased and spacebased proposals to
provide additional context alongside the New Horizons encounter.

**=D8              **To inform about the 6-month-long New Horizons
encounter for those interested in proposing to the Pluto System Data
Analysis Program.

Dear All,

ALMA-T is collaborating with The North American ALMA Science Center 
(NAASC) in NRAO, organizing the 7th NAASC workshop jointly. This workshop 
will be held in April of 2013 in Hawaii. See below for the annoucement 
from NRAO.

>      "Transformational Science with ALMA" workshop

Dear Colleagues,

The North American ALMA Science Center (NAASC), in cooperation with the 
Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA) in Taiwan, 
is pleased to announce the 7th NAASC workshop entitled: “Transformational 
Science with ALMA: From Dust to Rocks to Planets – the Formation and 
Evolution of Planetary Systems." This NAASC-ASIAA "2013 Rocks!" workshop 
will be held 8-12 April 2013 at the Hilton Waikoloa Village on the Big 
Island of Hawaii.

In this workshop, investigators from around the world will explore the 
evolution of protostellar disks from formation to dissipation, 
particularly at radio to submillimeter wavelengths. A focus of the 
workshop will be the processing of the gas and dust components, and the 
growth of planetesimals. We will also explore chemical changes, and 
radiative signatures from millimeter to submillimeter wavelengths. We will 
showcase results from ALMA early science projects and feature synergies 
with other telescopes, including the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array and 
telescopes located on Hawaii.

Please visit the workshop web site at http://www.cv.nrao.edu/rocks for 
additional information, including pre-registration.

2013 Rocks! is committed to broadening participation by women and 
under-represented minorities.
