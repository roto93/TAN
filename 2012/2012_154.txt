*** Special Seminar
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Dr. Robert Wittenmyer (University of New South Wales)
Topic:        Exoplanetary Science in Australia: Detection, Characterisation, and Destruction
Time:        9/5 (Wednesday) 14:00 - 15:30
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
I give an update on three major exoplanetary science initiatives being
pursued by Australian-based planet-search teams.  In addition to the
long-running Anglo-Australian Planet Search, I describe the Pan-Pacific
Planet Search, a radial-velocity survey of Southern hemisphere evolved,
intermediate-mass stars using the 3.9m Anglo-Australian Telescope.  We
currently achieve velocity precisions of 3-6 m/s, and there are several
planet candidates emerging as more data are obtained.  In collaboration
with John Johnson's Lick and Keck survey of Northern subgiants, this
all-sky survey of over 600 stars will significantly improve our
knowledge of the frequency and properties of planets orbiting stars more
massive than the Sun.

At New Zealand's Mt John Observatory, we are undertaking an intensive
observational campaign targeting the nearest Sun-like stars, Alpha
Centauri A & B, to search for Earth-like planets in their habitable
zones. We are observing year-round for 4 years, with the aim of
gathering 50,000 precision radial velocity measurements. This project is
the first ultra-deep reconnaissance of nearby Sun-like stars, which is
necessary to understand the frequency and characteristics of rocky
planets in potentially habitable orbits.

Finally, I present results from our recent series of papers in which we
have performed extensive suites of dynamical simulations to test the
veracity of proposed multiple-planet systems.  We show that some systems
are strongly constrained by protected low-order resonances, while others
are wildly unstable on short timescales.  This work highlights the
critical need to include dynamical stability analysis as an integral
part of the discovery process for candidate multi-planet systems.
