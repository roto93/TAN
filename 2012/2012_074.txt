Dear All,

  ALMA has issued a press release of the Cycle 0 result:

  ALMA Reveals Workings of Nearby Planetary System.

A new observatory still under construction has given astronomers a major 
breakthrough in understanding a nearby planetary system and provided 
valuable clues about how such systems form and evolve. Scientists using 
the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) have discovered 
that planets orbiting the star Fomalhaut must be much smaller than 
originally thought. This is the first published science result from ALMA 
in its first period of open observations for astronomers worldwide.

Dear all, upcoming Colloquium at IANCU (S4-Room 1013) are:

Title: TAOS: An Occultation Survey of the Outer Solar System
Speaker: Dr. Zhi-wei Zhang (ASIAA)
Date: 2012-04-20
Time: 14:00-15:00
Location: NCU, S4-1013
Abstract:

The Taiwanese-American Occultation Survey (TAOS) comprises an array of four 0.5-m
telescopes, installed at Lulin Observatory, to conduct a survey of the small objects in
Kuiper Belt by using the chance stellar occultation. Due to the flux drop of the
occultation event is small and the duration of it is less than a second, the multiple
telescope data is used to reduce the false positive rates and the zipper model data
acquisition is used to achieve the high-speed CCD imaging photometry of 5 Hz sampling
rate. The system is fully robotic and the status of the system can be monitored via
smart phone. Recently, TAOS is upgrading the camera to a frame transfer CCD camera. This
camera is able to do photometry at 10 Hz cadence with better SNR for the faint stars
compared to the current camera and covered with the FOV of 0.64 square deg. The upgrade
will finish in spring and start to collect data again. TAOS has been collected
scientific data since 2005. To date, over 90 TB raw images has been archived and more
than 500 billion photometric measurements has been produced. A successor survey, the
Trans-Neptunian Automated Occultation Survey (TAOS II) is currently being constructed.
This next generation survey will be more than one hundred times as sensitive as the
earlier survey. In order to reach the goal of one hundred times powerful, the
improvement of TAOS II will mainly come from (1) using three 1.3-m telescopes to monitor
10,000 stars, (2) using a camera with new CMOS devices capable of reading out at a
sampling rate of 20 Hz, (3) operating at San Pedro Martir Observatory (SPM), Mexico,
which has an average seeing around 0.6 arcsecond and more than 250 clear nights in a
year. The improvement on the software side, based on the experience of developing the
TAOS system, the TAOS II system will have (1) an unified structure for the control and
status message, (2) a better observation queue and scheduler, (3) an archive system to
manage the large data flow. The current status is in the progress of applying for the
permission to use the site. We expect to do the site development in the autumn of 2011,
to finish installing all three telescopes in early 2013. We expect to begin the survey
in mid-2013.

Title: Confirming and Constraining Kepler Planets via Transit Timing Variations
Speaker: Dr. Matthew J. Holman (Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics)
Date: 2012-05-04
Time: 14:00-15:00
Location: NCU, S4-1013
Abstract:

Of the more than 2,000 Kepler planet candidates that have been reported to date, a
significant fraction are in systems with multiple transiting planet candidates. In some
cases, the signature of the gravitational interactions between planets in these systems
can be seen in the variations of their times of transit. By carefully modeling the
transit times, as well as investigating long-term stability, we are able to measure or
constrain the masses and orbits of the transiting bodies in some of these systems,
verifying that they are indeed planets. Although this approach is particularly effective
for closely packed and near-resonant systems, it has also been applied to a broad range
of systems. These include circumbinary planets, as well as systems with additional
non-transiting planets. I review the process of using transit timing variations to
confirm Kepler planets.

> Subject: Third installment of Science Verification data of ALMA

Dear All,

The third installment of Science Verification data is now available. There 
are several new datasets in this release corresponding to targets 
suggested by the community and listed on the Science Verification web 
page.  We hope that you will find that the quality of these datasets is 
impressive, but please remember that ALMA is still in the construction 
phase, and we are continuously testing new observing modes.  These 
observations are made using new equipment and software and thus may 
contain more idiosyncrasies than data released to PIs in Early Science. 
There are data reduction suggestions for these datasets provided in the 
form of a script, as well as additional information about the dataset in a 
README file.

This installment of Science Verification data contains the following:

     BR1202-0725 at z=4.7: redshifted CII line in Band 7
     IRAS16293:  Band 6 observations centered on the CH3CN ladder and HNCO
     Centaurus A: a 48pt mosaic of the central parsecs in Band 6
     Orion KL: several tunings combined to provide a spectral survey in Band 6
