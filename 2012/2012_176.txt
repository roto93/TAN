Dear Colleagues, 

You are cordially invited to attend the Joint Colloquium 
which will be held on October 09 (next Tuesday). 
The Joint Colloquium Series is organized by 
the NTU Physics Department, Center for Condensed Matter Science (CCMS), 
Leung Center for Cosmology and Particle Astrophysics (LeCosPA), 
Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA), 
and the Institute of Atomic and Molecular Sciences (IAMS). 
The idea is to have excellent speakers to give inspiring, informative, 
but non-technical talks on the frontiers of Sciences. 

Enclosed below is the information of the Joint Colloquium on October 09. 

Best regards, 

Pisin Chen (LeCosPA) 
Ting-Wai Chiu (NTU-Phys) 
Michitoshi Hayashi (CCMS) 
Lain-Jong Li (IAMS)

ASIAA/CCMS/IAMS/LeCosPA/NTU-Physics Joint Colloquium 
Speaker: Prof. Fong Chao(Director, Institute of Earth Sciences,  
Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan) 
              (趙丰 所長) 
Topic: 地球、天文與中國古傳說的對話 
      When modern Earth Science meets ancient Chinese legends 
Time: 10/09 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:10 
Place: Room 104, CCMS-New Physics Building 

Abstract : 
    
中國古傳說裡種種異象與異事，可否、或如何以科學來解釋？邀你來當福爾摩斯，根据最遠古的實物、文字、記載，推敲以現代科學對地球自然環境的認識和了解，在這些問題上提供新的思維，試解遠古神秘的謎團。 
  Ever wonder what were actually said in those most mysterious  
ancient legends of China eons ago? Can they be explained in terms of  
our modern knowledge of Earth science ? Let's play Sherlock Holmes and  
explore together and try to offer insightful scientific explanations  
of what really did happen, based on ancient records, documents,  
artifacts, and our new ways of thinking.
