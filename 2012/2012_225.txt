Dear LOT users and friends of Lulin,

Attn: TELESCOPE FEES ANNOUNCEMENT


I would like to take this opportunity to thank all our users of LOT (and others facilities at Lulin) for the approval of our services.
However, due to the financial difficulties, we are no longer able to support the facilities at Lulin Observatory by our institute alone.
Thus we would like call on our friends and users of Lulin to contribute and support the maintenance cost of the observatory.

After some considerations, we come up with a plan.
Starting from the semester 2013B, we are going to charge a fee for telescope use.
Lulin 1-m Telescope (LOT) will be charged for "Observing Time".
The rate will be "NTD 1000 per observing hour".
"Observing" is defined as when the dome and shutter are open for scientific data
(observation log will be taken as reference when necessary).

If you have applied or is going to apply for funding from NSC, please read on.
We have discussed with NSC about our intention. 
They agreed that "telescope using fees" can be included in NSC proposals.
If you are applying for a new NSC proposal (by the end of this year), please don't forget to put your request 
(e.g., how many hours observing time) into your new proposal.
If you are working on a multi-year NSC project, please add this item into the funding request next May 
(along with your mid-term report). 

Once again, thank you for using our facilities. 
Your continuous support is vital to the quality of the observatory.


best wishes,
Chung-Ming Ko (Director, Lulin Observatory).

> Subject: ASIAA/CCMS/IAMS/LeCosPA/NTU-Physics Joint Colloquium, November 27

Dear Colleagues,

You are cordially invited to attend the Joint Colloquium
which will be held on November 27.
The Joint Colloquium Series is organized by
the NTU Physics Department, Center for Condensed Matter Science (CCMS),
Leung Center for Cosmology and Particle Astrophysics (LeCosPA),
Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA),
and the Institute of Atomic and Molecular Sciences (IAMS).
The idea is to have excellent speakers to give inspiring, informative,
but non-technical talks on the frontiers of Sciences.

Enclosed below is the information of the Joint Colloquium on November 27.

Best regards,

Pisin Chen (LeCosPA)
Ting-Wai Chiu (NTU-Phys)
Michitoshi Hayashi (CCMS)
Lain-Jong Li (IAMS)
Michihiro Takami (ASIAA)

ASIAA/CCMS/IAMS/LeCosPA/NTU-Physics Joint Colloquium
Speaker: Prof. Din Ping Tsai (蔡定平 教授)
          (Physics Department, NTU)
          (Chair of IEEE Instrument and Measurement Society, Taipei Chapter)
          (Director and Distinguished Research Fellow, Research Center for
Applied Sciences, Academia Sinica)
Topic: Light Manipulation by Plasmonic Metamaterials
Time: 11/27 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:10
Place: Room 104, CCMS-New Physics Building

Abstract :
    Plasmonic metamaterials composited of artificial, subwavelength
structures with extraordinary properties which cannot be found in nature.
The development of plasmonic metamaterials has potentials for new frontier
of science including engineering, physics, biology and chemistry. During the
past decade, applications based on surface plasmon polaritons (SPP) have
been extensively developed in the field of optoelectronics, such as
plasmonic circuitry, nanolasers, ultrahigh-efficiency sensor, photovoltaics,
super-resolution imaging, and various two-dimensional plasmonic lens. Here,
we design, fabricate and integrate both of planar and three dimensional
plasmonic metamaterials for more realization on coupling effects between
plasmonic metamaterials and practical applications, such as
electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) through magnetic interaction,
toroidal metamaterials, light manipulation via nanostructures and
meta-surface, and optical hybrid-superlens hyperlens for super resolution
imaging. Moreover, high throughput of multilayer structures by laser direct
writing (LDW) technology also has been discussed and reported. Our findings
may lead to many interesting applications, such as three-dimensional
projector, polarization and spectral beam splitters, ultra-sensitive
refractive sensor, and surface plasmon coupler.
