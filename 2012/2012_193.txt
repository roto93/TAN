*** Colloquium
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Ryan Keenan (ASIAA)
Topic:        Investigations of Large-Scale Inhomogeneity in the Local Universe
Time:        10/26 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
The size of large-scale structures in the local universe (sheets, voids, and superclusters of galaxies), and our location among them, is of critical importance to the interpretation of observational results. Cosmic variance due to large-scale structure can lead to systematic variations in observational data. Such systematics can dominate over other sources of error if a volume sufficient to average over cosmic variance has not been sampled. However, it remains unclear just what the upper limit on the size of large-scale structure is, and hence what volume constitutes a representative sample of the universe.  I will summarize recent advances in theoretical and observational cosmology, including my own observational work, which suggest that large-scale inhomogeneities may yet present an obstacle in the determination of locally measured cosmological observables.


*** Special Seminar
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Dr. Kevin C. Xu (Caltech/IPAC)
Topic:        Close Major-Merger Pairs Since z=1: Evolution of Merger Rate & sSFR Enhancement
Time:        10/24 (Wednesday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
I will present results on the cosmic evolution of galaxy pairs based
on studies of two large samples, namely a local (z<0.1) sample (KPAIR, 170
pairs) and a sample of pairs with 0.2<z<1 selected in the the COSMOS
field (CPAIR, more than 300 pairs). We found a moderately strong
cosmic evolution for the pair fraction, with the evolution index of
2.2+-0.2. The pair fraction and the evolution show no significant
dependence on the stellar mass of the mergers.  Our quantitative
estimates indicate that major mergers have significant impact on the
stellar mass assembly of the most massive galaxies. Comparison with
the mass dependent (U)LIRG rates suggests that the frequency of
major-merger events is comparable to or higher than that of (U)LIRGs.
Results from a new IR study, using data taken from Herschel and
Spitzer surveys, showed a strong trend for the enhancement of the
specific star formation rate (sSFR) in these pairs to decrease with
increasing redshift, probably due to higher gas fractions in higher
redshift galaxy disks which in turn may weaken the tidal effects in
triggering starbursts.

> Subject: New ALMA Science Verification data release 

Dear ALMA users,

A new installment of Science Verification data is planned for release on 
26 October 2012. The datasets that will be included in this release 
correspond to targets suggested by the community and listed in Table 2 of 
the Science Verification web page.

The release will include the following Science Verification datasets:

- The protoplanetary disk HD163296: multiple spectral lines, demonstrating 
the mixed modes capability, at Bands 6 and 7

- The Galactic Centre, Sgr A*: recombination lines at Band 3

Future science verification releases will also be preceded by a similar 
announcement.

Edwige from the Taiwan ARC node contributed Band 6 of HD163296 work.

Best Regards,
Chin-Fei

Dear Yi-Jehng,

Could you circulate the following announcement to the TAN?

Thank you very much.
Cheers

Dear all,

Here you are a announcement for those of you interested in Data Intensive
Astronomy, Virtual Observatory and Astroinformatics.

Next week there is an international conference on Computer Science and
Big Data organized in Taipei on the Academia Sinica, Nangang campus:
CODATA 23 "Open data and information for a changing planet"
(http://www.codata2012.com), starting on Sunday 28 and ending on
Wednesday 31.

I am chairing a Session on "Data Intensive Astronomy in East Asia" on:
*==* Wednesday 31st from 9:00am to 10:30am *==*

For this I have invited three specialists on this topic from Japan (Masatoshi
Ohishi, NAOJ; Prof. Ken Ebisawa JAXA/ISAS; Dr. Masumi Shomojo NAOJ)
and one from China (Dr. Chenzhou Cui, NAOC ). We will also have the
contribution from Kuei-Sheng Lee (NCU) and myself (Seb Foucaud, NTNU).

The detailed program is available on the following webpage:
http://www.codata.org/Taipei/official-program.html

This is a unique opportunity to learn more about the latest status of
this crucial topic in our countries.

Please circulate this to your collaborators/students who may be interested.

Hope to see you next week at AS-Nangang.
If you need more information please consult the conference webpage
(http://www.codata2012.com) or contact me.

Best regards,
Seb
