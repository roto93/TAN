Dear all, below is the information for upcoming special colloquium at IANCU;

Title: Optical and NIR polarimetric studies towards star-forming regions
Speaker: Dr. Chakali Eswaraiah (ARIES, Nainial, INDIA.)
Date: 2012-01-03
Time: 15:00-16:00
Location: NCU, S4-1013
Abstract:

Linear polariemetric observations in optical and near-infrared wavelengths are useful
tools to study the dust grain properties as well as to map the magnetic field
orientation towards various Galactic environments especially towards the star-forming
and molecular cloud regions. We have demonstrated that the Stokes plane in combination
with optical color-color diagram can efficiently be used to identify the probable
members of star clusters. Since young-stellar-objects (YSOs) with circumstellar material
exhibit either intrinsic polarization or rotation in their polarization angles,
consequently show scattered distribution in the stokes plane. The stokes plane can also
be used to identify the YSOs. In this talk, I will present our recent results based on
optical polarimetric observations of three star-forming regions NGC1893, Berkeley 59,
NGC1931 and one isolated molecular cloud core B227. I will also present preliminary
results for Carina Nebula and RCW57 based on NIR polarimetric observations.
