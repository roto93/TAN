Dear Yi-Jehng,

Would you please post the following information at TAN?

thanks,

The National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ) invites applications
for one vacant position to work for Subaru telescope, an optical-infrared
telescope at the 4,200 m (13,460ft.) summit of Mauna Kea on the island of
Hawaii. NAOJ operates the Subaru telescope for open use observations, and
is also active in the research and development for its future systems. We
are seeking an assistant professor that assumes leadership role in the
research and development activities for the telescope and instrument
systems to maintain and advance further its high level of science outputs.
More information on the position, including how to apply for the position,
is available at
http://www.subarutelescope.org/Announce/2012/06/08/index.html.

The position of the Assistant Professor with the Subaru Telescope, National
Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ) is based in Hilo, Hawaii, U.S.A.
Primary duties and responsibilities of the incumbent is to maintain and
improve the performance of the telescope system including instrumentation,
from research scientist point or view, as follows:

-      Leads, by taking full advantage of strengths of the Subaru
Telescope, development of new instrumentation to assure continued
production of first class sciences in the coming decade

-      Directs the development of new instrumentation, by working closely
with the engineers of the Telescope Engineering Division and Instrument
Division, to the highest level of readiness and operability both from
system engineering viewpoint and for the benefit of common use operation on
the Subaru Telescope

-      Plans and proposes modifications and upgrades of the telescope and
instrumentation in order to operate them strategically and reliably in the
era entering the construction of extremely large telescope

Application document must be received by no later than August 15, 2012. I
would appreciate serious consideration of relevant researchers.

With best wishes,

Nobuo Arimoto (sent by N. Ohashi)
Director, Subaru telescope, NAOJ

Abstract: http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/activity/colloquium.php

*** Colloquium
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Dr. Frédéric Deschamps (Institute of Earth Sciences, AS)
Topic:        The role of anti-freeze compounds in maintaining subsurface oceans  in icy moons' interiors
Time:        6/22 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
A key parameter that controls the crystalization of primordial oceans in large icy moons is the presence of anti-freeze compounds. The phase diagram of the water-ammonia system is well documented, and several studies showed that the presence of a few wt% of ammonia in the primordial oceans of icy moons may stop the crystalization of these oceans. Another anti-freeze compound that may be present in Titan's interior is methanol. Using a thermodynamic model of the solar nebula and assuming a plausible composition of its initial gas phase, we first calculate the condensation sequence of ices in Saturn's feeding zone, and show that in Titan's building blocks methanol can have a mass fraction of ~4 wt% relative to water, i.e., methanol can be up to four times more abundant than ammonia. We then combine available data on the phase diagram of the water-methanol system and scaling laws derived from thermal convection to estimate the influence of methanol on the dynamics of the outer !
ice I shell and on the heat transfer through this layer. Our results indicate that a small fraction of methanol, which is consistent with the determination of Titan's building blocks composition, strongly reduces the vigor of convection in the outer ice shell. The effect of 5 wt% methanol is equivalent to that of 3 wt% ammonia. Thus, if methanol is present in the primordial ocean of Titan, the crystallization may stop, and a sub-surface ocean may be maintained between the ice I and high pressure ice layers. A preliminary estimate indicates that the presence of 4 wt% methanol and 1 wt% ammonia may result in an ocean at least 90 km thick.

Dear Potential ALMA users,

    The writing camp will be in room 1107 in the ASMAB building from June 18 to 
20 in the afternoon from 1pm to 5pm. We will hire an english editor. We 
strongly encourage all the potential ALMA users to join this camp even if you 
have not signed up or are too busy to sign up for the camp. The presence of 
faculty members would be very important for the success of this camp.

Cheers,
Chin-Fei

Dear Potential ALMA users in Taiwan,

A PI in Taiwan has access to ALMA through both East Asia (EA) and North 
America (NA) regions. He/She can register in the ALMA Science Portal. 
After registration, the user can select freely (and also can change it) to 
which region the time should be charged to. Also for submitting Helpdesk 
tickets, both regions can be selected. Accordingly, and since as a rule, 
ALMA users should have only a single account. If you have two accounts, 
you should have received a email informing you that the two accounts would 
be merged. If they are not merged automatically, please remove one or 
submit a Helpdesk ticket. With the account, you should be able to see a 
drop-down menu in Observing Tool (OT) for you to select which region to 
submit your proposal. If you don't see the drop-down menu in OT, then you 
may need to reset/update your institution in your profile in the science 
portal.

In Cycle 1, a PI in Taiwan can also have a 50/50 split option for time 
charge. To facilitate the explanation, here we assume some one submits a 
proposal with this split option, and requests a total time of 10 hrs, 
i.e., 5 hrs in EA and 5 hrs in NA.

If one selects the split option, it depends on where the proposal stands 
in BOTH queues. For the proposal to be accepted, it needs to fit within 
BOTH queues; i.e., for the above proposal submitted for Cycle 1, the 5 hrs 
needs to fit within the NA 270 hr allotment and the other 5 hrs needs to 
fit within the EA 180 hr allotment. If it only fits within one queue and 
not the other, it will not be given a "High Priority" status.

Note that this is not necessarily a double jeopardy; it depends on the 
relative over-subscription between the two regions, and how close to the 
dividing line the proposal lies. Not obvious for the example of a 10 hrs 
proposal; more-so for larger proposals where e.g. fitting 20 hrs into two 
queues is easier than fitting 40hrs into one.

On the other hand, a Taiwanese PI can submit two 5hr proposals SEPARATELY, 
one with EA as the Executive, another with NA as the Executive. Then each 
part would be judged against the relevant queue, - they get all the time 
if they pass both Executives cutoff; they get 5 hrs if they only pass one 
Executives cutoff.

Note that this workflow would only work for projects that could be split 
by number of targets, not total integration time, since there is a 
prohibition against submitting the exact same proposal with different 
Executive affiliations.

Best Regards,
Chin-Fei
On behalf of Taiwan ARC Node
