Dear All,

  ALMA has issued a press release of the Cycle 0 result:

  ALMA Reveals Workings of Nearby Planetary System.

A new observatory still under construction has given astronomers a major 
breakthrough in understanding a nearby planetary system and provided 
valuable clues about how such systems form and evolve. Scientists using 
the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) have discovered 
that planets orbiting the star Fomalhaut must be much smaller than 
originally thought. This is the first published science result from ALMA 
in its first period of open observations for astronomers worldwide.

On behalf of the Taiwan ARC node
