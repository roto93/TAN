Dear all, upcoming Colloquium at IANCU (S4-Room 1013) is:

Title: Comparing RAVE data to the Besancon Galactic Model
Speaker: Dr. Andreas Ritter (IANCU)
Date: 2012-06-15
Time: 14:00-15:00
Location: NCU, S4-1013
Abstract:

The RAdial Velocity Experiment (RAVE, Steinmetz 2003) is an ongoing major spectroscopic
survey of the southern hemisphere. It offers the first truly representative inventory of
stellar radial velocities for all major components of the Galaxy, using the CaII triplet
region (8480--8740 Angstroms) to determine the radial velocities and stellar atmospheric
parameters like the effective temperature, surface gravity and metallicity of the
observed stars. The spectra are taken with the 6df multi-object spectrograph at the
UK-Schmidt telescope, situated at the Siding Spring Observatory in Australia. This
unique data set allows us for the first time to test the theoretical models of the
Galaxy for the whole southern hemisphere. I have developed a computational framework to
compare any large Galactic survey to Models of the Galaxy using statistical methods, and
the visualisation of the results. The application of this framework to the RAVE survey
and the Besancon Galactic Model (Robin 1986) reveals systematic discrepancies between
the measured and predicted parameter distributions, a different vertical metallicity
gradient, and a wealth of substructures (most of them new) in the Galaxy.
