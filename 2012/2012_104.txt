Taiwan Mock Review of ALMA Proposals

The Taiwan ARC node will hold a mock review of ALMA proposals for Cycle 1,
as for Cycle 0.  In Cycle 0, the over-subscription rate was more than 8!  In
Cycle 1, the over-subscription rate may be even higher.  Thus, only very
well-prepared proposals will succeed.  Prospective users should have their
proposals prepared now.

Proposals fail sometimes due to 1) unclear science questions or goals and/or
poorly designed experimenting methods/approaches, but also often due to 2)
poor writing or last minute compilation.  The purpose of this review is to
improve the quality of ALMA-T proposals for better success rate by enforcing
potential users to prepare the proposals early, thus, to at least eliminate
the last minute writing and to further sharpen the science ideas.

This mock review is mainly targeted at new users, postdocs, and students in
Taiwan.  Nonetheless, all Taiwanese users are welcome to submit their
proposals.

The proposal submission deadline is 2012.06.22.  Full proposal, including
scientific and technical justification, figures and tables, is required to
submit to arc@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw in pdf format.  Half-cooked proposals will
benefit little from mock reviewing.  Technical assessment will be carried
out by the Taiwan ARC staff.  Scientific review will be conducted through
paper by a review panel, including Vivien Chen, Naomi Hirano, Sheng-Yuan
Liu, Kazushi Sakamoto, and Wei-Hao Wang.

Technical and scientific review comments will feedback to the PIs through
email about 10 days later on 2011.07.02.  Face-to-face discussion with the
ARC staff or review panel members may be considered and arranged.  PIs can
incorporate these comments into proposal revision before "true" submission.

Best,
Chin-Fei
On behalf of Taiwan ARC Node
