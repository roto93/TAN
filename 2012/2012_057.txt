Dear Colleagues,

The NTU Physics Department, Center for Condensed Matter Science, Institute
of Atomic and Molecular Sciences, and the Academia Sinica Institute of
Astronomy and Astrophysics invite everyone to our joint colloquium series.
The speakers are all famous international scholars and the colloquia are
aiming at a broad audience, including undergraduate students. Below is the
information of the talk on March 27(Tuesday). Please help to forward this
to the colleagues in your departments.

Speaker: Chung-Pei Ma, UC Berkeley
 Topic: Monster Black Holes
Time: 03/27 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:10
Place: Chin-Pao Yang Lecture Hall (r104), CCM-New Physics Building

Abstract: Black holes are among the most fascinating astrophysical objects
and have long entranced the public. For over three decades, the giant
elliptical galaxy Messier 87 has hosted the most massive known black hole
in the local Universe. I will describe the recent discovery of  two
record-breaking black holes, each with ten billion solar masses, in an
ongoing survey of centers of nearby massive galaxies. The existence of
these supermassive black holes have interesting implications for the growth
of the largest galaxies in the Universe.

Brief Bio: Professor Ma is a theoretical cosmologist and astrophysicist.
She received both her undergraduate and Ph.D. degrees in physics from the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Before joining the faculty at UC
Berkeley in 2002, she was a postdoctoral fellow at the California Institute
of Technology and an Assistant and Associate Professor of Physics and
Astronomy at the University of Pennsylvania, where she won the Lindback
Award for Distinguished Teaching. She has also won the Maria Goeppert Mayer
Award (2003), OYRA (2001), Annie J. Cannon Award (1997), and Cottrell
Scholar. Ma is an avid violin player and was an exchange student at the New
England Conservatory of Music in Boston while studying cosmic strings and
theoretical cosmology at MIT.  She was the first prize winner in the Taiwan
National Violin Competition in 1983. Ma is the cosmology scientific editor
for the Astrophysical Journal.
