  ALMA Call for Proposals for Cycle 1

  The ALMA Director, on behalf of the Joint ALMA Observatory (JAO) and the
  three partner organizations in East Asia, Europe and North America, is
  pleased to announce the release of the Early Science Cycle 1 Call for
  Proposals (CfP). Members of the astronomical community are invited to
  propose for scientific observations to be scheduled during the period from
  January to October 2013.

  While the highest priority of the ALMA project continues to be the
  completion of the full 66-antenna array, Cycle 1 observations provide a
  significant opportunity for science from this unique world-class facility.


  <Capabilities>
  The ALMA Early Science Cycle 1 capabilities will include:
  - Thirty-two 12-m antennas in the 12-m Array
  - 12-m Array configurations with maximum baselines ranging from ~160 m to ~1
    km
  - Nine 7-m antennas, and two 12-m antennas for total power (single dish)
    observations, in the Atacama Compact Array (ACA), for use in combination
with 12-m Array observations for imaging of extended structures
  - Receiver bands 3, 6, 7 & 9 (wavelengths of about 3, 1.3, 0.8 and 0.45 mm)
  - Single field imaging and mosaics of up to 150 pointings
  - Continuum and spectral line observations

  It is anticipated that 800 hours of 12-m Array time and up to 800 hours of
  ACA time will be available for Cycle 1 projects.  Complete details are
  available in the Cycle 1 Proposer┬ Guide.

  <Best efforts>
  Cycle 1 observations will be conducted on a best effort basis, analogous to
  Cycle 0, in parallel with the ongoing construction, commissioning and
  verification of the whole ALMA system. The completion of the array of 66
  antennas with the full set of scientific capabilities, expected in the
  second half of 2013, is the highest priority of the Observatory.

  Therefore, the following constraints will apply during Cycle 1:

  -Projects will not be carried over from Cycle 1 to later cycles (even if
they have not been completed in Cycle 1) and will not establish proprietary
rights beyond the standard 12-month period.
  -ALMA staff will conduct quality assurance on ALMA data and provide
processed data products through the respective ALMA Regional Centers (ARCs).
However, it cannot be guaranteed that the characterization and quality of the
data and data reduction will meet the standards expected when ALMA is in full
scientific operations. Proposers should expect that significant experience in
radio (in particular, millimeter) interferometry, though not required, will be
an advantage in working with the data products during ALMA Early Science,
particularly for projects that include Band 9 or ACA components.

  <Proposal submission>
  The Science Portal at www.almascience.org is the principal resource for
  information for scientific users regarding observing with ALMA. All
  proposals must be prepared and submitted electronically using the ALMA
  Observing Tool (OT) software. The OT and a LaTeX template, recommended for
  preparation of the scientific and technical justification, are available
  for download at the ALMA Science Portal. Registration in the Science Portal
  is required for submission of ALMA proposals and is available at all times.

  Deadline for proposal submission is 15:00 UT on July 12, 2012

  <Relevant documents>
  All documents relevant to this CfP are available in the ALMA Science
  Portal. In particular, proposers are advised to consult the Proposer┬
  Guide, the Technical Handbook, and the Early Science Primer.

  <How to get help>
  For specific information not provided in the Science Portal, proposers may
  submit a ticket to the Helpdesk, or consult the Knowledgebase/FAQ, both
  linked from the Science Portal. Registration in the ALMA Science Portal is
  needed for submission of Helpdesk tickets.

  <Access to ALMA data>
  Data from completed Science Verification projects, designed to test ALMA
  systems and confirm their performance, is available in the Science Portal,
  together with detailed information on observations planned within the
  Science Verification program.

  Data from ALMA observations will be accessible to the community through the
  Science Portal upon expiration of the standard 12-month proprietary period.

  <Proposal review process>
  All proposals submitted in response to this CfP will be subject to peer
  review by a single international committee. Proposals will be assessed on
  the basis of their overall scientific merit and the potential contribution
  to the advancement of scientific knowledge, as well as on the extent to
  which the planned observations demonstrate and exploit the ALMA Cycle 1
  capabilities. Projects having the potential of delivering scientifically
  worthwhile results from relatively short observations will be favorably
  considered.  Science Assessors will be advised to consider Cycle 1
  proposals for their own merit, independent of Cycle 0 results.

  <Important dates>
  The key dates for Cycle 1 are given below. ALMA reserves the right to alter
  the given dates, should it become necessary to do so.

Dear Potential ALMA users,

SMA TAC members from Taiwan recently posted their advices on SMA proposal writing
at http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/%7Esma/ .
These may be useful for ALMA proposers too.

Best,
Kazushi Sakamoto
(SMA-T TAC chair)
