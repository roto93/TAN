Dear All,
I'd like to bring to your attention three Faculty positions open at Queen's
http://jobregister.aas.org/job_view?JobID=42178

The AAS job register advertises two positions, but with staffing
rearrangements here this will almost certainly become three.

We are searching for high calibre candidates with outstanding
research records who are potential team leaders. Successful
candidates will be provided with resources to build and lead a
research team.

The deadline for applications is 6th July.
regards
Stephen
