Topic:		Exploring the Dark Universe with Gravitational Lensing
Time:		3/12 (Monday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:		 R1203
Abstract:
Understanding the nature of dark energy and dark matter is one of the biggest challenges in modern cosmology.  Strong gravitational lens systems provide a powerful tool for measuring cosmological parameters and for probing dark matter in galaxies.  I will describe how strong lens systems with measured time delays between the multiple images can be used to determine the "time-delay distance" to the lens, which is primarily sensitive to the Hubble constant.  I will present the prospects for using time-delay lenses to measure the Hubble constant to 1% precision and accuracy, which will provide critical independent constraints on the nature of dark energy, the spatial curvature of the Universe and neutrino physics.  To study properties of dark matter, I will show how a combination of lensing and stellar kinematics can be used to disentangle dark matter and baryons in spiral galaxies, measure the shape of dark matter halos, and probe the stellar initial mass function.  In additio!
 n, a novel approach to determine the dark matter halo sizes of galaxies in groups and clusters will be presented.  I will discuss the prospects for measuring the inner dark matter profiles in galaxies and determining the efficiency of tidal stripping in galaxy groups/clusters, both of which will provide key insights into the co-evolution of galaxies and dark matter.

Topic:		Suzaku Observations of Radio lobes in Active Galaxies
Time:		3/14 (Wednesday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:		 R1203
Abstract:
The jet from active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is one of the most gigantic features of energy concentration and dissipation in the universe. The dissipated energy and material are deposited in the radio lobes, which should exhibit footprints of the past activities of the jet in its surface brightness distribution of the non-thermal emission. The radio and X-ray observations are useful to estimate the energy in the lobes respectively probing the synchrotron and inverse Compton emission off of relativistic electrons. However, the observations of radio lobes are difficult, in particular, in the X-rays, as the emission is extended and low in surface brightness and is often overwhelmed by thermal emission of the host galaxies. We use the Suzaku X-ray Observatory, which has a wide-band spectroscopic capability with an unprecedentedly low and stable background. We observed Fornax A, which is one of the closest and largest radio lobes from the radio galaxy NGC1316. We estimated the non-!
 thermal energy density using the emission above the 10 keV band, in which thermal contamination is negligible. We also identified thermal emission associated to the lobe, which has not been recognized before. We found a spatial difference in the brightness distribution of the X-ray emission, which we speculate was caused from the varying jet orientation in the past.
