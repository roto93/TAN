              RadioNet workshop
          ADVANCED RADIO ASTRONOMY
Commissioning Skills and Preparation for the SKA

13 November morning to 16 November lunchtime 2012
          JBCA, University of Manchester, UK

http://www.alma.ac.uk/events/radionet-advanced-radio-astronomy

The upgraded and new radio arrays (ALMA, e-MERLIN, JVLA, KAT7, LOFAR , ASCAP,
MeerKAT, NOEMA, SKA etc.) aim to make their data accessible to all astronomers.
Nonetheless, there is still a need for a core of experts to lead ambitious
science projects and to test, operate and develop radio instruments.

This workshop will communicate skills that you need to help comission a radio
interferometry array or work on early science data. Talks and discussion
sessions will share best practices between people working on the arrays,
lessons from comissioning scientists and the experiences of working on early
science data. Real issues which have arisen at individual arrays will be used
as examples for problem-solving group sessions.

Sessions will be led by expert astronomers and engineers from these arrays; so
far confirmed:

    Robert Laing (ALMA),
    Simon Garrington (e-MERLIN/VLBI),
    Rick Perley (JVLA),
    Michiel Brentjens (LOFAR)
    Anita Richards (RadioNet),
    Roshene McCool (SKA)

There is no registration fee but please register as soon as possible at since
capacity is limited.
