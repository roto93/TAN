Abstract:
With the Magellanic Mopra Assessment (MAGMA), we have recently 
completed a CO imaging survey of the most luminous giant molecular 
clouds (GMCs) in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) with the Mopra 
mm-wave telescope.  In this talk I will describe recent progress in 
deepening our understanding of GMC evolution using CO surveys of the 
LMC.  Molecular gas is found in regions with high gas columns, but 
high gas columns do not guarantee CO detection.  The inferred 
properties of the GMCs depend a great deal on the analysis technique, 
and the expected size-linewidth correlation only becomes apparent on 
large scales. The velocity gradients across GMCs are similar to those 
found in the surrounding atomic gas and do not appear indicative of 
rotation.  Examining the CO detection statistics towards candidate 
young stellar objects (YSOs), we find that more luminous YSOs are more 
likely to show detectable CO emission.  Conversely, more luminous GMCs 
are more likely to contain YSOs.  On the other hand, the virial 
parameter of a GMC has little influence on whether it is likely to 
exhibit massive star formation.  Our results support a tight linkage 
between molecular gas and star formation but call into question the 
assumption that GMCs are gravitationally bound (and thus long-lived) 
entities.
