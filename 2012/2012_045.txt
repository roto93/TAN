We would like to invite you to attend and present a paper at the AOGS 2012
session

PS12 on ¡§Microwave and Infrared Remote Sensing of Solar System Objects¡¨

This session will address all aspects of investigations of the terrestrial and other atmospheres in the solar system and beyond as well as surface properties of solar system bodies, using remote sensing techniques in the cm, mm, submm and infrared wavelengths range. This includes new ground-based, air- and spaceborne instrument developments, development proposals and related topics (i.e. frontends, backends, receivers, spectrometers, interferometers, components, mechanisms, concepts, calibration, the baseline problem, etc.), radiative transfer and retrieval simulations, new observations (Earth, planets, exoplanets, comets, moons, asteroids, KBOs, etc. from the ground, airborne and space borne), their validation, analysis and interpretation (e.g. atmospheric dynamics, chemistry and evolution, surface mineralogy, thermo-physical properties, regolith studies etc.). Specially welcome are presentations of Herschel results and on the newly proposed FIRE/MELOS instrument.
