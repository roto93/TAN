Dear all, below is the information for upcoming colloquium at IANCU:

Title: Lunar Internal Structure Estimated From Local Admittance Between Gravity and
Topography
Speaker:  Dr. Noriyuki Namiki (Deputy director of Planetary Exploration Research Center)
Date:  2012-02-24
Time: 14:00-15:00
Location: NCU, S4-1013
Abstract:

Gravity measurement by Kaguya main orbiter and subsatellite successfully achieved the
first direct observation of the gravity field over the farside of the Moon, and enabled
global gravity field modeling of the Moon. Three versions of the lunar global gravity
filed model have been publicized at web site of SELENE Data Archive and a new version
will be released soon. The new spherical harmonic model of the lunar gravity field,
complete to degree and order 100, reveals a general agreement with a previous lunar
gravity models on nearside. On farside, in contrast, the new gravity field model shows
several circular signatures that correspond to topographic structures such as
Moscoviense, Freundlich-Sharonov, Mendeleev, Hertzsprung, Korolev and Apollo basins.
Those basins used to be identified as linear signatures in previous models. On the basis
of new global gravity model, we classify lunar basins into Type I, Type II, and primary
mascon basins.
