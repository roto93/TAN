Topic:        Investigations of Large-Scale Inhomogeneity in the Local Universe
Time:        10/26 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
The size of large-scale structures in the local universe (sheets, voids, and superclusters of galaxies), and our location among them, is of critical importance to the interpretation of observational results. Cosmic variance due to large-scale structure can lead to systematic variations in observational data. Such systematics can dominate over other sources of error if a volume sufficient to average over cosmic variance has not been sampled. However, it remains unclear just what the upper limit on the size of large-scale structure is, and hence what volume constitutes a representative sample of the universe.  I will summarize recent advances in theoretical and observational cosmology, including my own observational work, which suggest that large-scale inhomogeneities may yet present an obstacle in the determination of locally measured cosmological observables.

Topic:        Close Major-Merger Pairs Since z=1: Evolution of Merger Rate & sSFR Enhancement
Time:        10/24 (Wednesday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
I will present results on the cosmic evolution of galaxy pairs based
on studies of two large samples, namely a local (z<0.1) sample (KPAIR, 170
pairs) and a sample of pairs with 0.2<z<1 selected in the the COSMOS
field (CPAIR, more than 300 pairs). We found a moderately strong
cosmic evolution for the pair fraction, with the evolution index of
2.2+-0.2. The pair fraction and the evolution show no significant
dependence on the stellar mass of the mergers.  Our quantitative
estimates indicate that major mergers have significant impact on the
stellar mass assembly of the most massive galaxies. Comparison with
the mass dependent (U)LIRG rates suggests that the frequency of
major-merger events is comparable to or higher than that of (U)LIRGs.
Results from a new IR study, using data taken from Herschel and
Spitzer surveys, showed a strong trend for the enhancement of the
specific star formation rate (sSFR) in these pairs to decrease with
increasing redshift, probably due to higher gas fractions in higher
redshift galaxy disks which in turn may weaken the tidal effects in
triggering starbursts.
