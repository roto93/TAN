Dear All,


Here we are sending you 2nd announcement of the 2013 ASIAA-NAASC ALMA workshop, which will be held
in Kona, Hawaii, on 8 - 12 April, 2013. The deadline of the abstract submission is now extended to Dec. 31, 2012.
We encourage people to submit abstracts.


Sincerely,
Shigehisa Takakuwa, on behalf of LOC 

-----------------------------------------------------------------
The Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA<http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw>) in Taiwan and the North American ALMA Science Center (NAASC <https://safe.nrao.edu/wiki/bin/view/ALMA/NAASC>) are pleased to announce the first ASIAA-NAASC joint ALMA workshop entitled: “Transformational Science with ALMA: From Dust to Rocks to Planets – the Formation and Evolution of Planetary Systems." This ASIAA-NAASC "2013 Rocks!" workshop will be held 8-12 April 2013 on the Big Island of Hawaii. The deadline for submitting abstracts is now extended to December 31. For those who are interested in this workshop, please visit our website at http://www.cv.nrao.edu/rocks/ now, and complete the preregistration and abstract submission by the deadline. Also, remember to like us on Facebook <https://www.facebook.com/2013Rocks> in order to get the most recent updates and announcements posted by the meeting organizers and your colleagues.



Join your colleagues on the Big Island of Hawaii, April 8-12, 2013 to explore the evolution of material in protostellar disks from formation to dissipation. The Island of Hawai'i is home to the largest observatory in the Northern Hemisphere, and is the site of extensive, collaborative, international research efforts. A focus of the workshop will be the processing of the gas and dust components, and the growth of planetesimals. We will also explore chemical changes, and radiative signatures at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths. We will showcase results from ALMA early science projects and feature synergies with other telescopes that can help to advance this field, particularly those sited on the island of Hawaii. This workshop will prepare us for the exciting adventures ahead in the new era and will not only focus on the new opportunities in astronomy but also foster new collaborations with geologists, chemists, engineers and biologists to investigate the origins of co!
smic material in the universe.

2013 Rocks! is committed to broadening participation by women and under-represented minorities.
