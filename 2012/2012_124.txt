Topic:        Accretion in Protoplanetary Disks: Magneto-rotational Instability or Magneto-centrifugal Wind?
Time:        6/29 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
Magnetic field is widely believed to play a crucial role in
driving accretion in astrophysical disks, mainly via the
magneto-rotational instability (MRI) or the magneto-centrifugal wind. In
protoplanetary disks (PPDs), these mechanisms are strongly affected by
non-ideal MHD effects (Ohmic resistivity, Hall effect and ambipolar
diffusion) due to the weak ionization level in PPDs. In this talk, I first
examine the effectiveness of the MRI by applying simulation results in
different non-ideal MHD regimes to PPD models. It is found that in the
inner region of PPDs (~1AU), the MRI itself is insufficient to account for
the observed PPD accretion rates. The MRI works more efficiently in the
outer disk, especially in the presence of PAHs which reduces the strength
of ambipolar diffusion. In the second part of the talk, I describe our
vertically stratified shearing-box simulations of PPDs that for the first
time, simultaneously include the effects of both Ohmic resistivity and
ambipolar diffusion in a self-consistent manner. In the presence of a weak
net vertical magnetic field (beta~1e5 at midplane), the MRI is completely
suppressed in the inner region of PPDs, where the gas flow is purely
laminar. A a strong magneto-centrifugal wind is launched that efficiently
carries away the disk angular momentum, and the resulting wind-driven
accretion rate is consistent with observations. I conclude by proposing a
new scenario on the accretion processes in PPDs.

Topic:        The Herschel Planetary Nebula Survey (HerPlaNS)
Time:        6/25 (Monday) 15:30 - 16:30
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
HerPlaNS is a Herschel Open Time program that exploits the unprecedented spatial resolving power in the far infrared of the Herschel Space Observatory to investigate a sample of 11 planetary nebulae (PNe). The aim of the program is to study the chemistry, the energetics and the physical evolution of the nebula by tracing the cold dust component by means of imaging data with PACS and SPIRE and tracing the gas component by means of spectroscopy observations with PACS and SPIRE at different locations in the nebula. Combining both imaging and spectroscopy data will teach us about the interplay between the gas and dust as well as the interaction between the stellar material and the interstellar medium. HerPlaNS offers a novel view of Planetary Nebulae by it spatial spectral and imaging data. In this talk, l will introduce the HerPlaNS program and discuss some of our preliminary results.
