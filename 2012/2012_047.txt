2012 Carnegie Observatories Graduate Research Fellowship

We announce the continuation of the Graduate Research Fellowship at the
Carnegie Observatories in Pasadena, California.  This Fellowship provides a
stipend to graduate students interested in carrying out all or part of
their thesis research under the supervision of a Carnegie Staff member, in
residence at Carnegie.  We encourage applications from current Ph.D.
graduate students in astronomy from an accredited (US or non-US)
university, pursuing thesis research in observational astronomy,
theoretical astrophysics, or instrumentation development.  The student must
have completed all requisite coursework and examinations prior to arriving
at Carnegie.  The Fellowship, beginning in September, 2012, will be awarded
for one year and may be renewed for two additional years.  Foreign students
should note that Carnegie can only consider applicants who hold or are
eligible to obtain a J-1 visa.

Carnegie Observatories provides a vibrant environment for vigorous
scientific research and academic excellence.  Major areas of research
include cosmology and the distance scale, physics of active galactic
nuclei, searches for massive black holes, galaxy formation and evolution,
galaxy groups and clusters, intergalactic medium, star formation,
supernovae, star clusters, and nucleosynthesis and chemical abundances of
stars.

Carnegie observing facilities at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile include
the two 6.5-meter Magellan telescopes, the 2.5-meter du Pont telescope, and
the 1.0-meter Swope telescope.  In addition, the scientific Staff actively
pursues research using a wide range of ground-based and space-based
facilities, across the electromagnetic spectrum from radio to X-rays.

The application should include a curriculum vitae, bibliography, brief
essay describing the applicant's current research, research proposal based
on a project sponsored by a Carnegie Staff member, transcript of grades,
approval letter from the department head of the applicant's home
institution, and three letters of reference.  Applications are due by April
15, 2012, 17:00 PST.  Full details of the program and application
instructions can be found at this web site: http://obs.carnegiescience.**
