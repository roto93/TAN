              RadioNet workshop
          ADVANCED RADIO ASTRONOMY
Commissioning Skills and Preparation for the SKA

13 November morning to 16 November lunchtime 2012
          JBCA, University of Manchester, UK

http://www.alma.ac.uk/events/radionet-advanced-radio-astronomy

The upgraded and new radio arrays (ALMA, e-MERLIN, JVLA, KAT7, LOFAR , ASCAP,
MeerKAT, NOEMA, SKA etc.) aim to make their data accessible to all astronomers.
Nonetheless, there is still a need for a core of experts to lead ambitious
science projects and to test, operate and develop radio instruments.

This workshop will communicate skills that you need to help comission a radio
interferometry array or work on early science data. Talks and discussion
sessions will share best practices between people working on the arrays,
lessons from comissioning scientists and the experiences of working on early
science data. Real issues which have arisen at individual arrays will be used
as examples for problem-solving group sessions.

Sessions will be led by expert astronomers and engineers from these arrays; so
far confirmed:

    Robert Laing (ALMA),
    Simon Garrington (e-MERLIN/VLBI),
    Rick Perley (JVLA),
    Michiel Brentjens (LOFAR)
    Anita Richards (RadioNet),
    Roshene McCool (SKA)

There is no registration fee but please register as soon as possible at since
capacity is limited.

Abstract: http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/activity/colloquium.php

*** Colloquium
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Anthony Gonzalez (University of Florida)
Topic:        Galaxy Clusters at z=1-2: An Infrared View
Time:        10/5 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
While the galaxy cluster population at z<1 has long been accessible, only in recent years has it become possible to identify and study statistical cluster samples in the redshift regime z=1-2. This era is of particular interest because it is expected to be the formation epoch for the first massive galaxy clusters and also provides a direct view of the cluster galaxy population during a period of significant star formation and mass assembly. In this talk I will describe a series of surveys based upon Spitzer and WISE data that are designed to identify large samples of clusters at these redshifts, complementing the new generation of Sunyaev-Zel'dovich surveys. I will also present recent results, including a few surprises, from detailed follow-up studies of a subset of these clusters with HST, Spitzer, and ground-based facilities.
