Speaker:	Dr. Ramon Brasser (ASIAA)
Topic:		The Great Archean Bombardment
Time:		4/27 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:		 R1203
Abstract:
The Late Heavy Bombardment (LHB), together with the Great Archean
Bombardment on Earth, constitutes an epoch of intense cratering on the
terrestrial planets and the Moon approximately 500 Myr after their
formation. Here I present evidence for the LHB having occurred and
demonstrate that this had to coincide with a major event in the solar
system. The most likely explanation is an instability in the outer solar
system with the giant planets scattering each other onto eccentric
orbits. This scattering event destabilised asteroids from the now-empty
E-belt asteroid belt directly outside Mars and sent them towards the
terrestrial planets. The intensity, duration and latest models for the
bombardment are discussed.
