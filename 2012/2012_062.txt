Dear Colleagues,

The NRAO North American ALMA Science Center is pleased to announce that 
the Joint ALMA Observatory (JAO) expects to start the next cycle of Early 
Science observations (Cycle 1) in January 2013. A Call for Proposals for 
Early Science Cycle 1 will be issued at the end of May 2012, with an 
anticipated deadline for proposal submission in mid-July. ALMA Early 
Science Cycle 1 observations will start in January 2013 and span 10 
months. It is anticipated that approximately 800 hours of array time will 
be available for Cycle 1 projects. Any astronomer may submit a proposal in 
response to the ALMA Early Science Cycle 1 Call for Proposals. Cycle 1 
operations will be conducted on a best efforts basis, similar to the 
current Cycle 0 observations.

The full Cycle 1 announcement is available at
https://almascience.nrao.edu/news/pre-announcement-for-cycle-1

Detailed information on Cycle 1 will be published in the Call for
Proposals.

The announcement includes a call for Notices of Intent to submit an ALMA
proposal, due by May 15.

CAPABILITIES

The ALMA Early Science Cycle 1 anticipated capabilities will comprise:

    Thirty-two 12m antennas in the main array, nine 7m antennas (for
       short baselines) and two 12m antennas (for making single-dish maps) in the Atacama Compact
       Array (ACA)

    Receiver bands 3, 6, 7 and 9 (wavelengths of about 3, 1.3, 0.8 and 0.45 mm)

    Baselines up to 1km

    Both single field interferometry and mosaics

    Mixed correlator modes (both high and low frequency resolution in the same observation).

Use of the ACA for short baseline interferometry and single-dish observations will only be offered to complement observations with the main array, and not as a stand-alone capability. Single-dish use will be limited to spectral line observations. More details will be provided in the Call for Proposals.
