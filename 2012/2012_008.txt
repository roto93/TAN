Abstract: http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/activity/colloquium.php

*** Colloquium
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Keitaro Takahashi (Kumamoto University)
Topic:        Square Kilometer Array and related activity in Japan
Time:        1/13 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
Square Kilometer Array (SKA) is the next-generation cm-wave radio telescope
which will have a sensitivity better than the existence telescopes by more
than one order. It is expected to make a tremendous impact on many fields of
astrophysics and cosmology, such as cosmic reionization, cosmic magnetism
and pulsar study. In Japan, a consortium was established with more than 100
members and many researchers are studying SKA-related topics. In this talk I
will review the SKA plan, science and Japanese activity toward SKA. Possible
Taiwan-Japan collaborations are also argued.


*** Special Seminar
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Dr. Yin-Zhe Ma (U. of British Columbia)
Topic:        Cosmology on large and small cosmic scales
Time:        1/12 (Thursday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
In this talk, I am going to test the concordance cosmology in three different
cosmic scales. (1) On the super-horizon scale, “Copi etal. (2009)” have been
arguing that the lack of large angular correlations of the CMB temperature
field provides strong evidence against the standard, statistically isotropic,
LCDM cosmology. I am going to argue that the “ad-hoc” discrepancy is due to
the sub-optimal estimator of the low-l multipoles, and a posteriori
statistics, which exaggerates the statistical significance.
(2) LCDM model also predict the existence of primordial gravitational wave,
for which B-mode polarization will be a powerful tool to distinguish different
models of the early Universe; (3) On Galactic scales, “Watkins et al. (2008)”
shows that the very large bulk flow prefers a very large density fluctuation,
which seems to contradict to the LCDM model. We provide a physical explanation
for this big bulk flow, based on the assumption that CMB frame does not
coincide with matter rest frame, resulting in the tilted Universe. We show
that the ‘tilted Universe’ could well explain the bulk flow phenomena and more
importantly, the constraints for this tilted Universe can lead to the
constraint on the number of e-folds of inflation; (4) In addition, cosmic Mach
Number from peculiar velocity catalog may provide a powerful test of the
growth of the structure.

Dear all the colleagues:

    Our 13th Asia Pacific Winter School/Workshop will begin this Friday 
(Jan 13, 2012) and will end on the Firday a week later (Jan 20). In 
between, Jan 14 is the holiday for the presidential election. The lunar 
new year (Jan 23) was sort of cutting in abrupt, making the schedule a 
little hectic.

    However, we managed to line up the lecturers/speakers, which include 
Bob McKeown (Caltech /Jefferson Lab), Xiangdong Ji (Maryland/SJTU), 
Bo-Qiang Ma (Peking), J. Yokoyama (U. Tokyo), Sang Pyo Kim (Kunsan U), and 
others, even if the time was rather short. You and your students are so 
much welcome to this event. If you are interested in giving a talk (to 
enhance the interactions), please contact, at the meeting, Sang Pyo Kim or 
Bo-Qiang Ma for further arrangements. 

    So, again, to see you this Friday. Best wishes, W-Y. Pauchy Hwang
