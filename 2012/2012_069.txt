ASROC Logo Contest: please come to the ASROC2012 General Assembly to vote
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

A total of 168 designs submitted for the contest; after the screening by the
ASROC council, 23 design works were selected for the runoff.

Each ASROC member can have up to five votes for the best logo designs in the
runoff; the actual voting will be conducted during the ASROC2012 General
Assembly (May 25-27). Although all design works entered the finals will be
also printed on the ballot, we encourage all of you to take a close look of
these excellent designs (at http://www.asroc.org.tw/astro_logo/) when possible
prior to the GA meeting.

Please refer to TAN Issue (Oct 27 - Nov 01, 2011) for the background.

*** Colloquium

Speaker:	Dr. Chin-Wei Chen (ASIAA)
Topic:		The Scaling Relation of Early Type Galaxies in Virgo Cluster
Time:		4/13 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:		 R1203
Abstract:
We present photometric and structural parameters for 100 ACS Virgo Cluster Survey (ACSVCS) galaxies based on homogeneous, multi-wavelength (ugriz), wide-field SDSS (DR5) imaging. These early-type galaxies, which trace out the red sequence in the Virgo Cluster, span a factor of nearly ~103 in g-band luminosity. We describe an automated pipeline that generates background-subtracted mosaic images, masks field sources and measures mean shapes, total magnitudes, effective radii, and effective surface brightnesses using a model-independent approach. A parametric analysis of the surface brightness profiles is also carried out to obtain Sérsic-based structural parameters and mean galaxy colors. We compare the galaxy parameters to those in the literature, including those from the ACSVCS, finding good agreement in most cases, although the sizes of the brightest, and most extended, galaxies are found to be most uncertain and model dependent. Our photometry provides an external measure!
 ment of the random errors on total magnitudes from the widely used Virgo Cluster Catalog, which we estimate to be σ(BT )≈ 0.13 mag for the brightest galaxies, rising to ≈ 0.3 mag for galaxies at the faint end of our sample (BT ≈ 16). The distribution of axial ratios of low-mass ("dwarf") galaxies bears a strong resemblance to the one observed for the higher-mass ("giant") galaxies. The global structural parameters for the full galaxy sample—profile shape, effective radius, and mean surface brightness—are found to vary smoothly and systematically as a function of luminosity, with unmistakable evidence for changes in structural homology along the red sequence. As noted in previous studies, the ugriz galaxy colors show a nonlinear but smooth variation over a ~7 mag range in absolute magnitude, with an enhanced scatter for the faintest systems that is likely the signature of their more diverse star formation histories.

Astronomy and Astrophysics invite everyone to our joint colloquium series.
The speakers are all famous international scholars and the colloquia are
aiming at a broad audience, including undergraduate students. Below is the
information of the talk on April 17(Tuesday). Please help to forward this
to the colleagues in your departments.

Speaker: Tai C. Chiang (=E6=B1=9F=E5=8F=B0=E7=AB=A0), UIUC
 Topic: From the Photoelectric Effect to Modern Photoemission Spectroscopy
Time: 04/17 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:10
Place: Chin-Pao Yang Lecture Hall (r104), CCM-New Physics Building

Abstract: The photoelectric effect was discovered in 1887 by Hertz. It was
explained in terms of photons in 1905 by Einstein, whose theory was
verified experimentally by Millikan in 1916. Einstein and Millikan each
received a Nobel prize in 1921 and 1923, respectively, for their work on
this effect. It was later realized that the photoelectric effect could be
used to probe the electronic structure of materials. Atoms in solids are
bound together by valence electrons, and the valence electronic structure
is key to materials properties. With the advent of ultrahigh vacuum
techniques and intense synchrotron radiation sources, photoemission has
become a powerful tool for condensed matter research. Today it is broadly
applied to essentially all materials and systems of interest, including
surfaces, thin films, nanoscale materials, complex oxides, superconductors,
strongly correlated systems, magnetic materials, graphene systems,
topological insulators, etc. This talk will include a brief historical
review of important milestones, selected examples of recent studies, and
some remarks about future prospects.

Brief Bio: Tai C. Chiang graduated from National Taiwan University in 1971,
obtained his PhD from Berkeley in 1978, and worked afterwards as a
postdoctoral associated at IBM for two years. Since 1980, he has been a
faculty member in the Department of Physics, University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign. He is currently serving as Scientific Director of the
Synchrotron Radiation Center, University of Wisconsin-Madison. His research
focuses on the electronic and atomic structures and growth behavior of
surfaces, thin films, multilayers, nanoscale systems, complex oxides,
graphene materials, and topological insulators, with an emphasis on quantum
size effects, electron-phonon coupling, spin-orbit coupling, electron
correlation, critical phenomena, and phase transitions. He is primarily an
experimentalist, employing tools such as angle-resolved photoemission, core
level spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction, thermal diffuse scattering, and
inelastic x-ray scattering, but he also performs model and first-principles
calculations in support of his experimental program.
