Dear Potential ALMA users,

    The writing camp will be in room 1107 in the ASMAB building from June 18 to 
20 in the afternoon from 1pm to 5pm. We will hire an english editor. We 
strongly encourage all the potential ALMA users to join this camp even if you 
have not signed up or are too busy to sign up for the camp. The presence of 
faculty members would be very important for the success of this camp.

Cheers,
Chin-Fei
