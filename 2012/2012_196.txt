Aim of the workshop:

  Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), an international collaboration to
  build the unique world array of sub-mm VLBI, has been pioneering
  study of super-massive black holes with ultra-high resolution.
  In order to summarize the related activities in East Asia and to
  promote effective collaborations toward their ultimate project
  goals, we would like to hold a one-day workshop, where researchers
  working on mm/sub-mm VLBI and/or black hole science in EA region
  gather, exchange information and thoughts, and discuss the future
  directions.


Planned speakers and meeting program:

  Kazunori Akiyama    (NAOJ, Japan)
  Keiichi Asada    (ASIAA, Taiwan)
  Shep Doeleman    (MIT Haystack, USA)

  Zhi-Qiang Shen     (SHAO, China)

  There will be also slots for contributed talks, and both scientific
  and technical papers are welcome. However, since the workshop is
  only for one day, note that we may not be able to allocate all the
  contributed talks if there are too many applications.
