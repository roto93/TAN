> Subject: [NRAO-Announcements] NRAO Director Appointment

Dear Colleagues, 

I am very pleased to announce that Anthony James (Tony) Beasley has been unanimously approved as the next Director of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) by the Board of Trustees of Associated Universities, Inc. (AUI). The National Science Foundation (NSF) has also approved this appointment, and Tony has accepted. He will start at NRAO on or about May 21, 2012. 

As many of you know, Tony has had a long history with NRAO. After receiving his Bachelor's in Physics in 1986 and his Doctorate in Astrophysics in 1991 from the University of Sydney, he joined NRAO as a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Very Long Baseline Array in 1991. He was appointed as a Deputy Assistant Director in 1997, and served as Assistant Director from 1998 to 2000. 

In 2000, Tony left NRAO to become Project Manager for the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy. In 2004, he returned to NRAO as an Assistant Director, but this time as the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Project Manager at the Joint ALMA Office in Chile. In 2008, Tony joined the National Ecological Observatory Network as Chief Operating Officer and Project Manager. 

Despite his brief sabbatical from radio astronomy, Tony has continued to serve on many high profile advisory and review committees, including some with the International Square Kilometre Array project. Tony is widely known and highly respected in the radio astronomy community and at NSF for his professional experience and accomplishments. He has played key roles in the implementation of some the world¡¦s most advanced and successful radio astronomy facilities. 

Tony returns to NRAO at an exciting and challenging time, succeeding Fred K.Y. Lo, who has served as Director since 2002. With ALMA and the Expanded Very Large Array both starting early science, joining the reinvigorated Green Bank Telescope and Very Long Baseline Array, Tony will build upon the numerous Observatory achievements led by Fred over the past decade. We certainly owe Fred an enormous amount of gratitude for these accomplishments. 

During the coming months, Tony and Fred will work closely with the NRAO management team to ensure a smooth transition, and I will personally do everything possible to help.  We all look forward to Tony rejoining the AUI/NRAO team, while we thank Fred for his accomplishments. 

Best regards, 

Ethan Schreier, President 
Associated Universities, Inc.
