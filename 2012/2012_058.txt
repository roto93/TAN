FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT: BLACK HOLE UNIVERSE 2012
********************************************

Bamberg, Germany, 18-22 June 2012

Dear colleagues,

following a series of two summer schools and the 2011 Winchester
workshop on Black Hole Astrophysics, the European Union Initial
Training Network "Black Hole Universe" is convening the final
conference of the network, "Black Hole Universe 2012", from 18 June
until 22 June 2012 in Bamberg, Germany.

*TOPICS*

The aim of the conference (http://www.black-hole.eu/bhu2012) is to
provide an overview of the most important subjects in black hole
astrophysics through a series of 40 minute long review talks and 20
minute long scientific talks.

The conference is aimed towards both graduate students and young
researchers, as well as astrophysicists working in the field. In line
with the theme of the network, the conference will cover all types of
accreting astrophysical black holes in all wavebands, from X-ray
binary systems through ULXs to AGN, with a particular emphasis on
making connections across the mass and luminosity scales based on the
common physics between them and with other compact objects such as
neutron stars. Specific topics include:

* In- and outflows: Theory and Observations
 - accretion in AGN and Galactic black holes
 - Low-luminosity states of Black Hole Accretion

* Relativity and Black Holes
 - Relativistic iron lines
 - Gravitational waves from black holes

* Populations and Formation of Black Holes
 - Binary populations
 - Formation of Galactic Black Holes
 - Black Hole evolution

* Future Observational Needs and Theoretical Challenges

Invited speakers include Tamara Bogdanovic, Laura Brenneman, Jason
Dexter, Chris Fryer, Ryan Hickox, Jonathan McKinney, Joey Neilsen,
Michael A. Nowak and Francesca Panessa.

*VENUE AND ACCOMMODATION*

The conference will be held in the historic "Spiegelsaal" in the
center of Bamberg, Germany. The medieval center of Bamberg and its art
nouveau suburbs is a UNESCO world heritage site, with more than 2000
buildings on the state register of historic places. Accommodation
(45-70 EUR per night and person including breakfast) has been reserved
in good hotels in walking distance from the venue and the center.

*CONFERENCE FEES AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT*

The registration fee for the conference will be 100 EUR for attendants
without a PhD and 200 EUR for attendants with a PhD. This fee includes
the conference booklet, conference dinner, and all coffee breaks.

Limited financial support is available, especially for graduate
students and for scientists from non-1st world countries. Support can
include conference fee waivers, (partial) support for accommodation,
and travel support. In order to request support, during registration
please submit a PDF with a short description of your scientific
interest and funding. In case of PhD students, please attach a letter
of support from the thesis supervisor. Decisions will be made on a
case-by-case basis by early May.
