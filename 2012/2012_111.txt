Announcement
------------

The UCAT Center for ALMA Science Advancement (tuCASA) of the University
Consortium of ALMA-Taiwan (UCAT) and the ALMA Regional Center (Taiwan-ARC)
of ASIAA are pleased to host jointly the ALMA User Workshop 2012 for potential
ALMA users in Taiwan.

The ALMA User Workshop 2012 is designed for the preparation of ALMA Cycle 1
proposals, and is aimed for graduate students, postdocs, faculty members and
people who have attended our previous ALMA Novice-User Workshop 2010 and have
some basic knowledge of radio astronomy and interferometer background. This
workshop will be an informative, slightly more advanced ALMA workshop covering,
in addition to the basics, new capabilities of ALMA and new features in
Observing Tool (OT). 

The program of the ALMA User Workshop 2012 includes:
    * Theory of Interferometry & Calibration of Visibilities
    * Tools for ALMA : CASA 
    * ALMA progress report and Cycle 1 capabilities
    * Atacama Compact Array (ACA)
    * Suggestions from ALMA science assessor
    * User portal and Help Desk
    * Correlator & Splatalogue
    * ALMA Observing Tool
    * SIMDATA Simulation
    * Hand-on Exercise on OT/correlator/SIMDATA
