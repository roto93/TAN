*** Colloquium
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:	Stephane Guilloteau (Laboratoire d'Astrophysique de Bordeaux (LAB), Floirac, France)
Topic:		Molecular and continuum surveys as tools to determine the structure of protoplanetary disks: part II
Time:		3/9 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:		 R1203
Abstract:
The study of protoplanetary disks is essential to understand
how planetary systems form. Because of the small apparent sizes
of these discs, and of their low temperatures, mm interferometry
is a key to unveil the physical conditions in which planets may form.

In the first part, we shall show what has been learned from the still
relatively rare high resolution molecular line observations in terms
of temperature and chemistry, and how this compares to our a priori concepts
of proto-planetary disks, in particular the layered structure that all
chemical models predict. The complete inventory of molecules
will be presented, and perspectives for ALMA discussed.

In the second part, the informations derived from molecules will be compared
to those derived from dust observations. Progress towards constraining the
disk mass, a fundamental yet largely unconstrained  parameter will be reported.
Beyond this simple number, we will explore how the dust to gas ratio can be
studied, in particular in view of the recent and on coming progress in 
observational facilities.
