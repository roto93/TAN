Dear Colleagues,

You are cordially invited to attend the Joint Colloquium
which will be held on November 06.
The Joint Colloquium Series is organized by
the NTU Physics Department, Center for Condensed Matter Science (CCMS),
Leung Center for Cosmology and Particle Astrophysics (LeCosPA),
Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA),
and the Institute of Atomic and Molecular Sciences (IAMS).
The idea is to have excellent speakers to give inspiring, informative,
but non-technical talks on the frontiers of Sciences.

Enclosed below is the information of the Joint Colloquium on November 06.

Best regards,

Pisin Chen (LeCosPA)
Ting-Wai Chiu (NTU-Phys)
Michitoshi Hayashi (CCMS)
Lain-Jong Li (IAMS)
Michihiro Takami (ASIAA)

ASIAA/CCMS/IAMS/LeCosPA/NTU-Physics Joint Colloquium
Speaker: Prof. Jean Turner(University of California, Los Angeles, USA)
Topic: Molecular Gas and Star Formation in Galaxies
Time: 11/06 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:10
Place: Room 104, CCMS-New Physics Building

Brief Bio. :
    Professor Turner is an extragalactic astrophysicist. She received  
her A.B. and Ph.D. degrees at Harvard University and UC Berkeley.  
Before joining UCLA as professor, she worked at the  
Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, and has been a Visiting  
Scientist at Caltech, Space Telescope, and the Joint ALMA Observatory.  
She has contributed to the development and commissioning of two  
millimeter and submillimeter telescopes. She is a fellow of the  
American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Abstract :
    The development of millimeter-wave array telescopes has made it  
possible to study gas and star formation in galaxies beyond the Milky  
Way. Dense gas is the fuel for star formation, and it can be mapped  
via its emission lines of molecules such as carbon monoxide. The  
dynamics, excitation and chemistry of the gas can be studied in a  
range of galactic environments, including galactic nuclei and  
starbursts. What facilitates and regulates star formation in galaxies?  
How does star formation shape galactic structure? I discuss recent  
results from the Submillimeter Array, and the potential for future  
discoveries with the Atacama Large Millimeter-Submillimeter Array  
(ALMA).
