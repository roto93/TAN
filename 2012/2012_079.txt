SECOND ANNOUNCEMENT: BLACK HOLE UNIVERSE 2012
*********************************************

Bamberg, Germany, 18-22 June 2012

Dear colleagues,

This is the final reminder that the registration and abstract deadline
for the conference "Black Hole Universe 2012" is on 30 April 2012. We
apologize if you are not interested in the conference - if you have
not registered, you will receive no further emails from us.

This conference is the final conference of the European Union Initial
Training Network "Black Hole Universe". It follows a series of two
summer schools and the 2011 Winchester workshop on Black Hole
Astrophysics. Please see http://www.black-hole.eu/bhu2012 for further
information.

*TOPICS*

The aim of the conference (http://www.black-hole.eu/bhu2012) is to
provide an overview of the most important subjects in black hole
astrophysics through a series of 40 minute long review talks and 20
minute long scientific talks. The conference is aimed towards both
graduate students and young researchers, as well as astrophysicists
working in the field. In line with the theme of the network, the
conference will cover all types of accreting astrophysical black holes
in all wavebands, from X-ray binary systems through ULXs to AGN, with
a particular emphasis on making connections across the mass and
luminosity scales based on the common physics between them and with
other compact objects such as neutron stars.

*VENUE AND ACCOMMODATION*

The conference will be held in the historic "Spiegelsaal" in the
center of Bamberg, Germany. Because of several large touristic events
during the time of the conference, we urge participants to reserve
their accommodation as quickly as possible. The deadline for hotel
reservations from the contingent available for the conference is 30
April.
