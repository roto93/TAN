Dear all,

Here you are a announcement for those of you interested in Data Intensive
Astronomy, Virtual Observatory and Astroinformatics.

Next week there is an international conference on Computer Science and
Big Data organized in Taipei on the Academia Sinica, Nangang campus:
CODATA 23 "Open data and information for a changing planet"
(http://www.codata2012.com), starting on Sunday 28 and ending on
Wednesday 31.

I am chairing a Session on "Data Intensive Astronomy in East Asia" on:
*==* Wednesday 31st from 9:00am to 10:30am *==*

For this I have invited three specialists on this topic from Japan (Masatoshi
Ohishi, NAOJ; Prof. Ken Ebisawa JAXA/ISAS; Dr. Masumi Shomojo NAOJ)
and one from China (Dr. Chenzhou Cui, NAOC ). We will also have the
contribution from Kuei-Sheng Lee (NCU) and myself (Seb Foucaud, NTNU).

The detailed program is available on the following webpage:
http://www.codata.org/Taipei/official-program.html

This is a unique opportunity to learn more about the latest status of
this crucial topic in our countries.

Please circulate this to your collaborators/students who may be interested.

Hope to see you next week at AS-Nangang.
If you need more information please consult the conference webpage

Best regards,
