> From: Ciska Kemper <ciska@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw>

Dear all,

Recently, ASIAA/Taiwan has joined the SPICA consortium, and will
contribute to the Mid-Infrared Spectrograph and Camera.

The SPICA mission has been reviewed by an international panel. The
panel issued a report on the various mission components, and a
response is expected. Thus, the SPICA MCS team will meet here at IAA
to obtain input on the response from the Taiwanese collaborators.

So, you are invited to a 2-day workshop on the SPICA MCS instrument at
IAA. A rough agenda is:

1 August 2012:
morning: presentations on SPICA MCS instrument, science cases,
Taiwanese contribution and the panel report
afternoon: discussion on how to address the panel report

2 August 2012:
morning: further discussion on how to address the panel report
afternoon: technical/instrumentation session

A more detailed agenda will be published as it becomes available.

For now, registration is opened for the meeting, with a deadline of 26
July. Please register at:

Best,
Ciska Kemper
