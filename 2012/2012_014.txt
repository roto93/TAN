*** Colloquium
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Prof. Yasushi Suto (The University of Tokyo)
Topic:        Colors of a second Earth
Time:        2/3 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
We develop a simple method to estimate the fractional areas of
different surface types on earth-like exoplanets from multi-band
photometry. Our attempt is to reproduce the scattered light curves as
a sum of the 5 surface types, i.e., ocean, soil, vegetation, snow and
cloud. We would like to answer an ambitious, but well-defined,
scientific question: "If we discover an exoplanet identical to the
Earth in the near future, can we infer the presence of vegetation
observationally ?''. This is why we intentionally and specifically
adopt the major surface types of the Earth, including vegetation, into
the analysis even though our method is thus inevitably
model-dependent. We apply our method to mock scattered light curves of
the Earth and to the real data from the Earth observing satellite. In
an idealized situation where the photometric errors are only photon
shot noise, we are able to reproduce the fractional areas of those
components fairly well. We may be even able to detect a signature of
vegetation from the distinct feature of photosynthesis on the Earth,
known as the red edge. In our reconstruction method, Rayleigh
scattering due to the atmosphere has an important effect, and for
terrestrial exoplanets with atmosphere similar to our Earth, it is
possible to estimate the presence of oceans and an atmosphere
simultaneously.
