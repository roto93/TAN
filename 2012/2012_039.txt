            Astronomical Society of the Republic of China 
                2012 Scientific Assembly (ASROC2012) 

          National Taitung University (Taitung Campus), Taitung 
                           May 25 - 27, 2012 

The Astronomical Society cordially invites you to participate in the 2012 
Scientific Assembly of the Astronomical Society of the Republic of China 
(ASROC2012) to be held at National Taitung University on May 25 - 27, 2012. 
This is the annual event for all astronomers and astrophysicists in Taiwan 
to demonstrate their most recent discoveries and observations, to report 
their latest research results and to exchange ideas as well as to organize 
collaborations. 

In this year's meeting, there will be the general assembly meeting, two 
plenary talks, scientific and educational sessions, as well as poster 
presentation. The plenary talks feature Dr. Michael Mumma, Director of the 
Goddard Center for Astrobiology at NASA Astrobiology Institute, on "Comet 
Taxonomy and Astrobiology", and Dr. Jesus Galindo Trejo, a senior research 
fellow at the Institute of Aesthetic Research at National Autonomous 
University of Mexico, on "Mayan Astronomy and 2012 Doomsday -- the Prophecy 
of Maya". All contributions in the meeting, including oral talks and poster 
presentations, will be published in the Journal of Taipei Astronomical 
Museum. Best poster awards will also be granted. 

In addition to the scientific agenda, the meeting will organize a group 
tour in the afternoon of May 26 (Sat). A conference banquet and a sky gazing 
event will later be held in the same evening. During the meeting, book and 
instrumentation exhibition are also expected. 

The ASROC2012 website is online from 2012 February 24; a tentative schedule 
of the meeting and the registration information will be available. Given 
the remote location of the meeting, the organizing committee will help 
making group reservations for the round-trip train tickets between Taipei 
and Taitung. For those who would like to enjoy our service, please do 
complete the registration before the early registration deadline (March 23). 
People who register after 2012 March 23 will need to make their own travel 
arrangements. Participants with contributions should submit their abstracts 
online by April 27. A registration fee of NTD500 should be paid on site. 
(Registration fee will be waived for ASROC members with 2012 annual 
membership fee paid.) Banquet charge of NTD50 per person shall also be paid 
on site.
