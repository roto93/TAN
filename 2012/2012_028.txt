Opportunities exist for undergraduate students who have completed not
less than 2 years of full time course work in Astronomy, Astrophysics,
Applied Physics, Engineering, Mathematics or related subjects to work
at the Australian Astronomical Observatory on research projects under
the individual supervision of AAO staff astronomers. In addition to
astronomical research, a major part of the Observatory's core business
is astronomical instrumentation for optical/infrared telescopes, and
studentships are available in this area as well.

Student Fellowships are available for 10 to 12 weeks in the period
mid-June to mid-September. The stipend for 2012 is A$686 per week.

The AAO headquarters is located in Epping, a suburb approximately
25 km from the centre of Sydney. A field trip is arranged to
visit the telescopes at Siding Spring Observatory.

Applications should be directed to A. Prof. Andrew Hopkins,
Head of AAT Science. For further details, including how to apply, see:

  *** Training Course on NCUcam-1 Operation and Data Reduction ***

This is an announcement for the training course on NCUcam-1 operation
and data reduction. NCUcam-1 is a new CCD imager that Institute of
Astronomy at National Central University has developed. NCUcam-1 is
equipeed with a thick fully depleted CCD and offers a superb
sensitivity at longer wavelength. It is now open for the astronomical
community in Taiwan as one of open-use instruments for Lulin One-meter
Telescope. The main purpose of the training course arranged this time
is to provide an opportunity for potential users actually to operate
the imager and obtain some data to deal with. For those who is
planning an observation using NCUcam-1 is highly encouraged to join
this program.

The training course consists of 3 parts: (1) 2-hr lecture at NCU main
campus, (2) training observation at Lulin Observatory, and (3)
hands-on lecture on data reduction at Tongpu. Participants are
expected to join all the 3 parts of this program.

Schedule:

  20/Feb/2012:    deadline of application submission
  25/Feb/2012:    announcement of participants selection
  02/Mar/2012:    2-hr lecture at NCU
  10-12/Mar/2012: 2-night observation at Lulin
  12-13/Mar/2012: hands-on lecture on data reduction

The lecture at NCU provides the basic concept and design of
NCUcam-1. After the lecture, participants form a group and start to
plan the observation. The observing time of Lulin One-meter Telescope
on 10 and 11 March 2012 is secured for this program. Participants
carry out the observations of photometric standard stars and a few
targets of their research topics. Calibration frames are obtained as
well. After the observation, participants will reduced the data at the
hands-on lecture. Basic CCD data reduction, astrometric calibration,
and simple aperture photometry are planned for this hands-on lecture.

For more information on NCUcam-1, please check following presentation
slide which was used for the Annual Meeting of Physics Society of
Taiwan in January 2012.

Brief description of your research topic:




Urgency of using NCUcam-1 for your research:




----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note:

- Due to the limited lodging space at Lulin Observatory, the number
  of participants is limited to 10 at the maximum.
- Participants need to find the financial support by themselves for
  their transportation, accommodation and other expenses for this
  program.
- Participants need to arrange their own transportation to/from Lulin
  Observatory. Participants also need to arrange their own
  accommodation at Tongpu for joining the hands-on lecture.
- Participants are expected to bring their own laptop computer with
  IRAF/SAOimage DS9/WCSTools/Source extractor installed.
- For the inquiry on the NCUcam-1 training course, please send a
  message to <ncucam1@s3b.astro.ncu.edu.tw>.

Dear all, upcoming Colloquium at IANCU (S4-Room 1013) are:

Title: Gamma-ray Burst Afterglows as Cosmic Probes
Speaker: Dr. Hsiao-Wen Chen (University of Chicago)
Date: 2012-02-10
Time: 14:00-15:00
Location: NCU, S4-1013
Abstract:

Gamma-ray bursts are among the most energetic events in the universe. Many bursts are
followed by extremely luminous optical afterglows that can serve as a sensitive probe of
"dark", intervening baryonic matter in space. I will review recent progress in our
understanding of interstellar medium and intergalactic matter in the distant universe,
through observations of long-duration gamma-ray bursts.

Dear all, below is the information for upcoming colloquium at IANCU:

Title: Lunar Internal Structure Estimated From Local Admittance Between Gravity and
Topography
Speaker:  Dr. Noriyuki Namiki (Deputy director of Planetary Exploration Research Center)
Date:  2012-02-24
Time: 14:00-15:00
Location: NCU, S4-1013
Abstract:

Gravity measurement by Kaguya main orbiter and subsatellite successfully achieved the
first direct observation of the gravity field over the farside of the Moon, and enabled
global gravity field modeling of the Moon. Three versions of the lunar global gravity
filed model have been publicized at web site of SELENE Data Archive and a new version
will be released soon. The new spherical harmonic model of the lunar gravity field,
complete to degree and order 100, reveals a general agreement with a previous lunar
gravity models on nearside. On farside, in contrast, the new gravity field model shows
several circular signatures that correspond to topographic structures such as
Moscoviense, Freundlich-Sharonov, Mendeleev, Hertzsprung, Korolev and Apollo basins.
Those basins used to be identified as linear signatures in previous models. On the basis
of new global gravity model, we classify lunar basins into Type I, Type II, and primary
mascon basins.
