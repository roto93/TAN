[Taiwan Proposal Announcement]

# FYI, original announcement from CFHT HQ is attached at the bottom  
of this mail.

############################################
  Proposals for CFHT Open for Semester 2013A
############################################

The 3.6 meter optical/infrared Canadian-France-Hawaii Telescope  
(CFHT) is
now open for proposals from all Taiwan-based researchers for semester  
2013A.
The deadline for proposal submission is:

2012 September 20 23:59 UT, which is 2012 September 21, 7:59 Taiwan time

We anticipate that a minimum of 5 nights, and possibly up to 8  
nights, will be available in semester 2013A,
depending on demand and quality of proposals. Please note that the  
instruments
available for 2013A are MegaCam,
WIRCam, ESPaDOnS, and PUEO with KIR.

Detailed information on the telescope, available instrumentation,  
proposal
format, and how to submit proposals is available from the CFHT web page:

http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/en/science/Proposals/

Note on WIRCAM:
For WIRCam, pay careful attention to the added note about narrow band
filters and their availability.

http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/en/science/QSO/ph1_WC.html


### Important Reminder ###

(1) If you have any problems with proposal submission and/or time
allocation for CFHT Taiwan Time, please contact the Taiwan TAC
(ohyama-at-asiaa.sinica.edu.tw) instead of contacting CFHT directly.

(2) Please fill in or update the status of all your previous projects on
the web page

https://oir.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/cfht/project [Authentication required]

You can and should provide more details on the progress of previous
(especially related) projects in the relevant section of your  
proposal. IF NO
INFORMATION IS FORTHCOMING, THE TAC WILL ASSUME THAT NO PROGRESS
HAS BEEN MADE AND WILL TAKE THIS INTO CONSIDERATION IN ALLOCATION
OF OBSERVING TIME.


### Exploratory Programs ###

To encourage innovative science, this semester we will continue  
considering
"exploratory" programs using MegaCam, WIRCam, or ESPaDOnS that require
no more than 1 hour of observing time. Such proposals will not be  
refereed, but
will be scrutinized by the TAC and allocated time based on scientific  
merit and
feasibility. When submitting such proposals, please state at the  
beginning of the
scientific justification that "This is an EXPLORATORY proposal".


### Queued Service Observations Snapshot Programs ###

In addition, we would like to bring to your attention the Queued  
Service Observation
(QSO) snapshot program. These are programs that can be executed with  
either
MegaCam or WIRCam in relatively poor seeing conditions when the  
seeing is <1.2".
Projects executed under the QSO snapshot program are not charged to the
available observing time for Taiwan. Proposals to the QSO snapshot  
program will not
be refereed, but will be scrutinized by the TAC for scientific value  
and feasibility.


### Resubmission due to Lost Time ###

If your scheduled project from previous semesters was not completed for
any reason (including bad weather), you will need to resubmit your  
proposal
explaining why you need more time. Your proposal will be stronger if  
the available data has
been analyzed, and you use this data to demonstrate that the stated  
science goals can be
achieved with allocation of the full requested time.


!!! New for 13A !!!
### Notes on Large Programs (LPs) ###

New large programs (LPs) will be launched from 2013A. Some of you may  
want to check possible duplication of your science targets with those  
programs.

For more information, please follow the links below:
http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/en/science/LargePrograms/index.php
http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/en/science/LP_13_16/index.php

For those who are participating those programs as one of co-Is,  
please note on the proposal that the program you are proposing is  
related to those LPs or not. When you propose new observing program 
(s) aside of your LP participation, please make sure and state  
somewhere in the proposal that you (and your co-Is) can execute both  
programs.


### Time Allocation Process ###

All new proposals, and where deemed necessary resubmitted proposals, are
refereed by researchers selected by the Taiwan-CFHT TAC based on  
their demonstrated
expertise in the relevant research fields.
Apart from the referees comments, who are asked to evaluate primarily  
the
scientific strength of the proposal, the Taiwan-CFHT TAC also takes  
into account
technical feasibility. For those who have previously been scheduled  
observing time
on the CFHT, the Taiwan-CFHT TAC will also take into account the  
status of previously
executed projects and publications.


### Status of Previous Proposals ###

Please fill in or update the status of all your previous projects on  
the web page
https://oir.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/cfht/ [Authentication required]

You can and should provide more details on the progress of previous
(especially related) projects in the relevant section of your  
proposal. If no information is
forthcoming, the TAC will assume that no progress has been made and  
will take this into
consideration in allocation of observing time.
