Dear LOT users and friends of Lulin,

Attn: TELESCOPE FEES ANNOUNCEMENT


I would like to take this opportunity to thank all our users of LOT (and others facilities at Lulin) for the approval of our services.
However, due to the financial difficulties, we are no longer able to support the facilities at Lulin Observatory by our institute alone.
Thus we would like call on our friends and users of Lulin to contribute and support the maintenance cost of the observatory.

After some considerations, we come up with a plan.
Starting from the semester 2013B, we are going to charge a fee for telescope use.
Lulin 1-m Telescope (LOT) will be charged for "Observing Time".
The rate will be "NTD 1000 per observing hour".
"Observing" is defined as when the dome and shutter are open for scientific data
(observation log will be taken as reference when necessary).

If you have applied or is going to apply for funding from NSC, please read on.
We have discussed with NSC about our intention. 
They agreed that "telescope using fees" can be included in NSC proposals.
If you are applying for a new NSC proposal (by the end of this year), please don't forget to put your request 
(e.g., how many hours observing time) into your new proposal.
If you are working on a multi-year NSC project, please add this item into the funding request next May 
(along with your mid-term report). 

Once again, thank you for using our facilities. 
Your continuous support is vital to the quality of the observatory.


best wishes,
Chung-Ming Ko (Director, Lulin Observatory).
