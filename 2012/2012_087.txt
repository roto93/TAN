SECOND ANNOUNCEMENT: BLACK HOLE UNIVERSE 2012
*********************************************

Bamberg, Germany, 18-22 June 2012

Dear colleagues,

This is the final reminder that the registration and abstract deadline
for the conference "Black Hole Universe 2012" is on 30 April 2012. We
apologize if you are not interested in the conference - if you have
not registered, you will receive no further emails from us.

This conference is the final conference of the European Union Initial
Training Network "Black Hole Universe". It follows a series of two
summer schools and the 2011 Winchester workshop on Black Hole
Astrophysics. Please see http://www.black-hole.eu/bhu2012 for further

*TOPICS*

The aim of the conference (http://www.black-hole.eu/bhu2012) is to
provide an overview of the most important subjects in black hole
astrophysics through a series of 40 minute long review talks and 20
minute long scientific talks. The conference is aimed towards both
graduate students and young researchers, as well as astrophysicists
working in the field. In line with the theme of the network, the
conference will cover all types of accreting astrophysical black holes
in all wavebands, from X-ray binary systems through ULXs to AGN, with
a particular emphasis on making connections across the mass and
luminosity scales based on the common physics between them and with
other compact objects such as neutron stars.

*VENUE AND ACCOMMODATION*

The conference will be held in the historic "Spiegelsaal" in the
center of Bamberg, Germany. Because of several large touristic events
during the time of the conference, we urge participants to reserve

Speaker: Chang C. Tsuei (=B1Z=B3=B9=B5X), IBM
Topic: Topological Nature of Superconducting =A3k-loops
Time: 05/08 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place: Chin-Pao Yang Lecture Hall (r104), CCM-New Physics Building

Abstract: The recent discovery of topological insulators and topological
superconductors has inspired numerous approaches to searching for the
elusive Majorana fermions in various condensed matter systems for potential
applications in topological quantum computing.
    In this talk, we will show that the time-reversed doubly degenerate
half flux quantum states in a d-wave superconductor-based =A3k-loop are
topologically protected by a parity effect arising from an odd number of
sign changes of the supercurrent circulating in the loop. The existence and
stability of Majorana zero modes bound to the half flux quantum vortex will
be discussed.

Speaker: Roger Blandford, SLAC
Topic: Higher Energy Astrophysics
Time: 05/08 (Tuesday) 15:30 - 16:30
Place: Chin-Pao Yang Lecture Hall (r104), CCM-New Physics Building

Abstract: Astronomical observations have demonstrated that cosmic sources
are capable of accelerating protons and electrons to unexpectedly large
energies with surprisingly high efficiency. Supernova remnants accelerate
protons and electrons to nearly a thousand times the energy produced by
terrestrial particle accelerators and unspecified, but cosmologically local
sources achieve proton energies nearly a million times greater than this.
Recent observations by the Auger, Chandra, Fermi, H.E.S.S., MAGIC and
VERITAS telescopes will be briefly summarized and it will be argued that
novel particle acceleration mechanisms are at work.

Brief Bio: Roger Blandford is a native of England and took his BA, MA and
PhD degrees at Cambridge University. Following postdoctoral research at
Cambridge, Princeton and Berkeley he took up a faculty position at Caltech
in 1976 where he was appointed as the Richard Chace Tolman Professor of
Theoretical Astrophysics. In 2003 He moved to Stanford University to become
the first Director of the Kavli Institute of Particle Astrophysics and
Cosmology and the Luke Blossom Chair in the School of Humanities and
Science. His research interests include black hole astrophysics, cosmology,
gravitational lensing, cosmic ray physics and compact stars. He is a Fellow
of the Royal Society and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and a
Member of the National Academy of Science.

Dear all, upcoming Colloquium at IANCU (S4-Room 1013) is:


Title: Current-Driven Kink Instability in Magnetically Dominated Relativistic Jet
Speaker: Dr. Yosuke Mizuno (NTHU Astronomy)
Date: 2012-05-11
Time: 14:00-15:00
Location: NCU, S4-1013
Abstract:

Relativistic jets have been observed or postulated in various astrophysical sources,
including active galactic nuclei (AGNs), microquasars in the galaxy and gamma-ray bursts
(GRBs). There are four major problems related to the relativistic jets: 1. formation
mechanism, 2. acceleration mechanism, 3. collimation mechanism, and 4.long-term
stability. The most promising mechanisms for producing and accelerating relativistic
jets, and maintaining collimated structure of relativistic jets involve
magnetohydrodynamical processes. We have investigated the temporal development of
current-driven (CD) kink instability in magnetically dominated relativistic jets via 3D
relativistic MHD simulations. In this investigation a static force-free equilibrium
helical magnetic configuration is considered in order to study the influence of the
initial configuration on the linear and nonlinear evolution of the instability. We found
that the initial configuration is strongly distorted but not disrupted by the CD kink
instability. The linear growth and nonlinear evolution of the CD kink instability
depends moderately on the radial density profile and strongly on the magnetic pitch
profile. We also present the influence of velocity shear surface on the temporal
development of the CD kink instability.

Dear All,

  I not only echo Wei-Shu's comments but just realized with surprise that
there will be two colloquiums back-to-back next Tuesday and Blandford's
talk is now scheduled at 15:30-16:30, for which I was never informed (as
the person in charge of the invitation). This schedule unfortunately would
not work for Blandford, for he needs to leave our campus at 16:00 to catch
the flight at 18:15. I have told him that his colloquium was at
14:20-15:30, our standard schedule and promised him that there would be
sufficient time for him to catch the flight. This conflict must be resolved
today.

  By the way, I understand that the 4-way Joint Colloquium has now formally
include LeCosPA as a co-organizer into a 5-way enterprise. Somehow this
announcement did not reflect that fact.

  Best regards,

Pisin

Dear all:

I'm sorry for the lack of communications.
We booked 5/8 for Dr. Tsuei before Blanford came in.  Raynien Kwo and I had
complained about the conflict months ago but got the response that Dr.
Tsuei's talk will be arranged in the first talk.

Since Dr. Tsuei will stay in NTU till Thursday, we will ask him to shift
his talk after Blanford's.

Speaker: Roger Blandford, SLAC
Topic: Higher Energy Astrophysics
Time: 05/08 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:30
Place: Chin-Pao Yang Lecture Hall (r104), CCMS-New Physics Building

Abstract: Astronomical observations have demonstrated that cosmic sources
are capable of accelerating protons and electrons to unexpectedly large
energies with surprisingly high efficiency. Supernova remnants accelerate
protons and electrons to nearly a thousand times the energy produced by
terrestrial particle accelerators and unspecified, but cosmologically local
sources achieve proton energies nearly a million times greater than this.
Recent observations by the Auger, Chandra, Fermi, H.E.S.S., MAGIC and
VERITAS telescopes will be briefly summarized and it will be argued that
novel particle acceleration mechanisms are at work.

Brief Bio: Roger Blandford is a native of England and took his BA, MA and
PhD degrees at Cambridge University. Following postdoctoral research at
Cambridge, Princeton and Berkeley he took up a faculty position at Caltech
in 1976 where he was appointed as the Richard Chace Tolman Professor of
Theoretical Astrophysics. In 2003 He moved to Stanford University to become
the first Director of the Kavli Institute of Particle Astrophysics and
Cosmology and the Luke Blossom Chair in the School of Humanities and
Science. His research interests include black hole astrophysics, cosmology,
gravitational lensing, cosmic ray physics and compact stars. He is a Fellow
of the Royal Society and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and a
Member of the National Academy of Science.

Speaker: Chang C. Tsuei (=B1Z=B3=B9=B5X), IBM
Topic: Topological Nature of Superconducting =A3k-loops
Time: 05/08 (Tuesday) 15:40 - 16:50
Place: Chin-Pao Yang Lecture Hall (r104), CCMS-New Physics Building

Abstract: The recent discovery of topological insulators and topological
superconductors has inspired numerous approaches to searching for the
elusive Majorana fermions in various condensed matter systems for potential
applications in topological quantum computing.
    In this talk, we will show that the time-reversed doubly degenerate
half flux quantum states in a d-wave superconductor-based =A3k-loop are
topologically protected by a parity effect arising from an odd number of
sign changes of the supercurrent circulating in the loop. The existence and
stability of Majorana zero modes bound to the half flux quantum vortex will
be discussed.
