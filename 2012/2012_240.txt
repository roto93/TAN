Announcement:

We are pleased to announce a 3-day workshop, the ALMA Imaging Workshop 2013
(AIW2013), to be held jointly by the UCAT Center for ALMA Science Advancement
(tuCASA) of the University Consortium of ALMA-Taiwan (UCAT) and the ALMA
Regional Center (Taiwan-ARC) of ASIAA for potential ALMA users in Taiwan.

    AIW2013 is designed for serious ALMA users who are committed to work on
ALMA data, have specific target sources and well-defined science goals in mind.
AIW2013 is aimed mainly for graduate students, postdocs and faculty members.
The data to be used for the workshop are Science Verification (SV) data and/or
the 1-year proprietary-period expired, open data of Cycle-0 high-priority
projects. Participants are required to have the self-selected datasets readily
downloaded prior to the time of the workshop; the available data can be found
at http://alma.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/twarc_tutorials_6th.php . The format of the
workshop will be lectures in the morning and hand-on exercise with the specific
participant-selected ALMA datasets in the afternoon basically. The AIW2013
program includes:

    * ALMA project progress, and Science using ALMA data
    * Imaging concepts (uv-coverage, weighting, cleaning [continuum/line])
    * Data Analysis (I): viewer, im/spec fittings, channel maps, pv diagrams
    * Data Analysis (II):  moment maps, FITS export/import
    * Hands-on exercise (I): data inspection (listobs, plotms)
    * Hands-on exercise (II): Imaging (continuum subtraction, clean, viewer)

The detailed program can be found at
