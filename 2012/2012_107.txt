Lulin One-meter Telescope (LOT) -- Call for Observing Proposals for 2012B

Proposal Deadline â€” 23:59 July 2 (Monday) 2012

The Lulin One-meter Telescope (LOT) solicits observing proposals for the 
semester of 2012B.  The new semester begins on 1 August 2012 and ends 
on 31 January 2013.

Those interested in applying for observing time can download the 
proposal LaTex package from the web page:

  http://www.astro.ncu.edu.tw/~wchen/lulinprop/lotprop.zip

The completed proposal should contain the filled and compiled version of the 
LaTex file (in PDF format), plus up to two PDF pages of scientific 
justification including figures, tables, and references.  The proposal 
(cover form and 2-page of scientific case) should be submitted to the 
following 
email address with subject title "LOT-2012B" :

  tac_lulin@astro.ncu.edu.tw

with a copy to me to avoid occasional erroneous delivery:

  wchen@astro.ncu.edu.tw

Please note that in addition to research proposals, we also accept 
educational 
programs for astronomical observation courses.  Time allocation will be 
announced 
by mid-July, 2012.

The Observatory management pays particular attention to the scientific 
products by 
our facilities.  So if you have used the LOT before, please fill in the 
status of 
the data, and any publications as results of any LOT data.

As usual, there will be three instruments available, the Lulin CCD Imager 
(LCI),  
the Lulin Compact Spectrograph (LCS), and TRIPOL, a simultaneous tricolor 
(g', r', i') imaging polarimeter.  At the time of this announcement, TRIPOL 
is being shaked down and characterized.  Those who are interested in the 
specs 
of any of these instrument should contact Lulin staff or me.  You can 
follow 
this url to get information regarding the telescope and instruments,

Feel free to direct inquiries about telescope/instrument/site to 
Mr Hung-Chin Lin (hclin@astro.ncu.edu.tw), Manager of the Lulin 
Observatory, or about time requests to me (wchen@astro.ncu.edu.tw)

Regards,

Wen Ping Chen
on behalf of the LOT Time Allocation Committee
