Dear all, upcoming Colloquium at IANCU (S4-Room 1013) is:


Title: Evidence for Radial Inflow in the Extended HI Disk of M83
Speaker:  Dr. Hsiang-Hsu Wang (ASIAA)
Date: 2012-06-01
Time: 14:00-15:00
Location: NCU,  S4-1013
Abstract:

Numerical simulations as well as indirect observational evidence suggest that typical
spiral galaxies are still accreting gas from the cosmic web even at present days.
However, the corresponding mass flow onto the outer disk and the subsequent inward
transport of material has not been observed directly. We combine interferometric data
from the VLA (obtained as part of the THINGS survey) as well as single dish data from
the 100m Effelsberg telescope to trace the distribution of atomic hydrogen (HI) far into
the outskirts of the nearby spiral galaxy M83. We use these data to search for evidence
of gas accretion of extragalactic origin onto the HI disk of M83. Using a novel Fourier
analysis approach we extract detailed information about the gas kinematics throughout
the HI disk of M83. We find a radial mass flow all the way from the extreme outer disk
to the inner parts of the galaxy where the gas is consumed by star formation. The amount
of material that is transported inwards is sufficient to form new stars at the observed
current rate of ~ 2.5 Msun/yr, allowing the galaxy to evolve in a quasi steady state.
For the first time, we can show that gas accretion and large-scale radial motions can
solve the problem of short gas depletion times in spiral galaxies.
