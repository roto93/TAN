*** Special Seminar
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Steven Charnley (NASA/GSFC)
Topic:        Theoretical Models of Astrochemical Processes
Time:        11/12 (Monday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
Interstellar chemistry provides a natural laboratory for studying exotic
species and processes at densities, temperatures, and reaction rates, that
are difficult or impractical to address in the laboratory. Thus, many
chemical reactions considered too slow by the standards of terrestrial
chemistry, can be `observed' and modeled. Various proposals concerning the
nature and chemistry of complex interstellar organic molecules will be
described. Catalytic reactions on grain surfaces can, in principle, lead to
a large variety of species and this has motivated many laboratory and
theoretical studies.  Gas phase processes may also build large species in
molecular clouds. Future laboratory data and computational tools needed to
construct accurate chemical models of various astronomical sources to be
observed by Herschel and ALMA will be outlined.
