Announcement:

We are pleased to announce a 3-day workshop, the ALMA Imaging Workshop 2013
(AIW2013), to be held jointly by the UCAT Center for ALMA Science Advancement
(tuCASA) of the University Consortium of ALMA-Taiwan (UCAT) and the ALMA
Regional Center (Taiwan-ARC) of ASIAA for potential ALMA users in Taiwan.

    AIW2013 is designed for serious ALMA users who are committed to work on
ALMA data, have specific target sources and well-defined science goals in mind.
AIW2013 is aimed mainly for graduate students, postdocs and faculty members.
The data to be used for the workshop are Science Verification (SV) data and/or
the 1-year proprietary-period expired, open data of Cycle-0 high-priority
projects. Participants are required to have the self-selected datasets readily
downloaded prior to the time of the workshop; the available data can be found
at http://alma.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/twarc_tutorials_6th.php . The format of the
workshop will be lectures in the morning and hand-on exercise with the specific
participant-selected ALMA datasets in the afternoon basically. The AIW2013
program includes:

    * ALMA project progress, and Science using ALMA data
    * Imaging concepts (uv-coverage, weighting, cleaning [continuum/line])
    * Data Analysis (I): viewer, im/spec fittings, channel maps, pv diagrams

*** Special Seminar
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Ryosuke Asano (Nagoya University)
Topic:        Evolution of grain size distribution in galaxies
Time:        12/17 (Monday) 15:30 - 16:30
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
Dust in galaxies affects the various evolutionary properties of
galaxies, like star
formation and spectral energy distribution (SED) of galaxies, etc.
Furthermore, these
effects depend strongly on the grain size distribution in galaxies as
well as the amount of dust.
Both the total dust mass and the grain size distribution in galaxies are
affected by various processes.
These processes occur in galaxies ubiquitously, and they depend strongly
on the metallicity,
the size distribution of grains. Hence, it is crucial to consider all
dust processes in a unified framework
to understand the evolution of the evolution of the total dust mass and
the grain size distribution in galaxies.
We construct a dust evolution model taking into account the grain size
distribution and investigate the evolution of the distribution in
galaxies. We consider three processes as follows: (1) dust destruction
by supernova (SN)
shocks, (2) metal accretion onto the grain surface in the interstellar
medium (ISM)
(3) grain-grain collisions in turbulence (shattering and coagulation).
In this talk, I will introduce our dust evolution model, show the
evolution of grain size distribution obtained by our model, and discuss
what process is the dominant source of the grain size distribution at
every stage of galaxy evolution.

Dear Colleagues,

You are cordially invited to attend the Joint Colloquium
which will be held on December 25.
The Joint Colloquium Series is organized by
the NTU Physics Department, Center for Condensed Matter Science (CCMS),
Leung Center for Cosmology and Particle Astrophysics (LeCosPA),
Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA),
and the Institute of Atomic and Molecular Sciences (IAMS).
The idea is to have excellent speakers to give inspiring, informative,
but non-technical talks on the frontiers of Sciences.

Enclosed below is the information of the Joint Colloquium on December 25.

Best regards,

Pisin Chen (LeCosPA)
Ting-Wai Chiu (NTU-Phys)
Michitoshi Hayashi (CCMS)
Lain-Jong Li (IAMS)
Michihiro Takami (ASIAA)

ASIAA/CCMS/IAMS/LeCosPA/NTU-Physics Joint Colloquium
Speaker: Prof. Martin L. Green
        ( Group Leader, Functional Properties Group, Materials  
Measurement Laboratory,
          National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), USA )
Topic: Materials for Sustainable Development.
Time : 12/25 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:10
Place: Room 104, CCMS-New Physics Building

Brief Bio. :
  Professor Martin L. Green is the leader of the Functional  
Properties Group of the Materials Measurement Laboratory at the  
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). His group  
incorporates experimental as well as computational approaches for  
understanding the fundamental properties of functional materials. He  
has B.S. and M.S. degrees in Metallurgy from the Polytechnic Institute  
of Brooklyn, and a Ph.D. in Materials Science from M.I.T. Dr. Green  
served as president of the Materials Research Society (MRS) in 2001,  
and is an MRS Fellow.


Abstract :
  Every human endeavor should be informed by sustainable development,  
because none of our material resources are infinite and only a few  
sources of energy are sustainable. The most common definition of  
sustainable development comes from the 1987 Brundtland report, “Our  
Common Future”, and states that “Sustainable development is  
development that meets the needs of the present without compromising  
the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.” However,  
this is not a scientific definition, and essentially refers to  
economic development.  Further, it requires that we know, or at least  
accurately estimate, what the needs of future generations will be. In  
this talk I will address the meaning and definition of sustainable  
development, and explore the space at its intersection with materials  
science. Materials have always served the role of technology enablers,  
and will continue to do so for sustainable development.  The immediate  
and direct connections between sustainable development and materials  
science include efficient use of materials (conservation,  
substitution, reuse, repurposing, recycling), materials life cycle  
assessment, replacement materials (scarcity, resource availability,  
materials flow analysis and economics), energy (materials to support  
alternative energy technologies, to mitigate problems with fossil-fuel  
technologies, and to increase energy efficiency), mitigation of  
undesirable impacts on environment and human health from technology  
and economic growth (corrosion, pollution, toxic waste), and water  
purification. I will also highlight a few examples of materials for  
sustainable development in research programs at NIST and elsewhere,  
such as materials for carbon capture, thermoelectric devices, and  
standards for bio-derived products.
