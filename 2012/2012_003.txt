Dear all, below is the information for upcoming colloquium at IANCU:

Title: Identification campaign of supernova remnant candidates in the Milky Way: Chandra
observation of G308.3-1.4
Speaker: Dr. Regina Huang (NTHU Astronomy)
Date: 2012-01-06
Time: 14:00-15:00
Location: NCU, S4-1013
Abstract:

ROSAT all-sky survey data have provided another window to search for supernova remnants
(SNRs). In reexamining this data archive, a list of unidentified extended X-ray objects
have been suggested as promising SNR candidate. However, most of these targets have not
yet been fully explored by the state-of-art X-ray observatories. For selecting a pilot
target for a long-term identification campaign, we have observed the brightest
candidate, G308.3-1.4, with Chandra X-ray observatory. An incomplete shell-like X-ray
structure which well-correlated with the radio shell emission at 843 MHz has been
revealed. The X-ray spectrum suggests the presence of a shock-heated plasma. The
brightest X-ray point source detected in this field-of-view is also the one locates
closest to the geometrical center of G308.3-1.4, which has a soft spectrum. The
intriguing temporal variability and the identification of optical/infrared counterpart
rule out the possibility of an isolated neutron star. Together with a putative
periodicity of ~1.4 hrs, the interesting excesses in the V-, B- bands, and H-alpha
suggest this source as a promising candidate of a compact binary survived in a supernova
explosion.
