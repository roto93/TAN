Dear Colleagues,

You are cordially invited to attend the Joint Colloquium
which will be held on December 18.
The Joint Colloquium Series is organized by
the NTU Physics Department, Center for Condensed Matter Science (CCMS),
Leung Center for Cosmology and Particle Astrophysics (LeCosPA),
Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA),
and the Institute of Atomic and Molecular Sciences (IAMS).
The idea is to have excellent speakers to give inspiring, informative,
but non-technical talks on the frontiers of Sciences.

Enclosed below is the information of the Joint Colloquium on December 18.

Best regards,

Pisin Chen (LeCosPA)
Ting-Wai Chiu (NTU-Phys)
Michitoshi Hayashi (CCMS)
Lain-Jong Li (IAMS)
Michihiro Takami (ASIAA)

ASIAA/CCMS/IAMS/LeCosPA/NTU-Physics Joint Colloquium
Speaker: Prof. Guido Tonelli
        ( Laureate of Special Fundamental Physics Prize (2012) )
        ( CMS Spokesperson (2010-2011) )
Topic: The discovery of a Higgs-like boson with the CMS detector:
        latest results and implications for the quest for new physics.
Time : 12/18 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:10
Place: Room 104, CCMS-New Physics Building

Abstract :
The most recent CMS results on the newly discovered boson will be  
described in detail with a particular attention to the study of the  
properties of the new particle. The implications of a 125 GeV boson on  
different scenario of new physics will be briefly discussed together  
with the prospects for further investigations in the next high-energy,  
high-luminosity runs of LHC.
