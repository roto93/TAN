 Subject: UK-Taiwan studentship funding opportunity

Dear Yi-Jehng, 

I am a Professor in the Department of Earth Science and Engineering at Imperial College London. I have just become aware of a funding opportunity for students from Taiwan to study at Imperial. The student should be nominated by a University in Taiwan and it could provide an opportunity to initiate collaboration between the UK and Taiwan. Details are below:

If you have any Masters students that would like to work in the field of extraterrestrial organic matter, Life detection space missions or mass extinction studies that I would be very happy to support an application. 

Please get in touch if you need any more information. 

Best regards 

Mark
