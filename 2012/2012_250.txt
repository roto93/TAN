1st Announcement of the International Francqui Symposium

Pre-Register <
https://fys.kuleuven.be/ster/meetings/francqui/pre-registration>


Symposium Scope and Objective:

Stellar astrophysics is the foundation of our understanding of the nature
of the Universe. The luminous energy emitted from the surfaces of stars has
given astrophysicists the clues to deduce the nature of stellar structure
and to map the physical changes stars undergo over their lifetimes, from
birth out of the interstellar medium to death as white dwarfs, neutron
stars or black holes. We have now reached the long-awaited stage where we
can test and improve our understanding of stellar structure and evolution
theory, with important implications for all research fields that build on
this foundation. For the first time we can peer into the interiors of stars
to see their structures using asteroseismology. This revolutionary new view
is the result of uninterrupted space photometry, precise to parts per
million, delivered for thousands of stars by the Kepler and CoRoT Space
Telescopes. The primary aim of these space missions is to detect exoplanet
systems, with an ultimate goal of finding Earth-like planets in the
habitable zone.  The ultra-high precision continuous observations obtained
have produced tremendous benefits for asteroseismology. Asteroseismic
inference of the exoplanet host star provides crucial input to characterise
the planetary system.  We can now peer into the interiors of stars in all
stages of evolution, including their red giant and compact stages - for
both binary and single stars - probing extreme physical conditions with
unprecedented confidence.  We can even perform asteroseismic galactic
studies of clusters and populations in the Milky Way.

The goal of this three-day symposium is to present recent progress in
asteroseismology to the broader astrophysics community and to discuss what
this field may offer to other research domains in astrophysics.  Keynote
invited speakers will cover broad areas of importance for astrophysics;
their review talks will be followed by dedicated talks on how
asteroseismology has brought, or will bring improvements in that topic. In
addition to these invited presentations, shorter contributed talks in this
same spirit will be solicited from the community. The list of invited
talks, as well as the programme, can be found here <
http://fys.kuleuven.be/ster/meetings/francqui/program> .


The Symposium is partly funded by and organised under the auspices of the
Francqui Foundation. It marks the end of the Advanced Grant: Probing
Stellar Physics and Testing Stellar Evolution through Asteroseismology
(PROSPERITY, http://www.ster.kuleuven.be/PROSPERITY) awarded to Conny Aerts
by the European Research Council.

The purpose of this 1st announcement is to make the community aware of the
symposium and to present the list of invited talks. A call for
participation, registration and abstract submission for a contributed talk
will be sent out in January 2013. Abstract submission closes on 31 March
2013 and contributed talks will be selected by 1 May 2013. The final
programme will be posted on the website by that date. Registration closes
on 1 July 2013.


Tutorial for junior post-docs

The symposium is followed by a one-day tutorial on 5 December 2013 at the
same venue for junior postdocs who will be provided with a training in the
theme of "How to survive from PhD to tenure-track" by several of the senior
invited speakers of the symposium. This tutorial is limited to 15
participants and constitutes of an intensive practical training in the
writing and defending of successful competitive peer-reviewed grant
applications.

*** Special Seminar

Speaker:    Katherine Lee (UIUC)
Topic:        Fragmentation and Kinematics of Starless Cores in Orion
Time:        12/24 (Monday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
We study the structure and kinematics of nine starless cores (0.1 pc) in Orion with the IRAM 30-m telescope and CARMA.  With the high angular resolution CARMA provides, fragmentation is observed in a majority of the cores.  By morphologically comparing the structures between the data from IRAM, CARMA and Herschel 500 micron images, it is shown that the starless cores and their fragments are formed along the ambient filamentary structures, implying the importance of filamentary structures in the star formation process.  In addition, we discovered large velocity gradients across the cores which are best interpreted as convergent flows.  All together, our study suggests that turbulent fragmentation occurs at the stagnation of the convergent flows. These cores may be seeds for future massive star formation through competitive accretion. However, as the number of fragments is less than the prediction from theories, magnetic fields and radiative feedback, which have the ability to!
  suppress fragmentation, may play a role in the core-forming process.

Speaker:    Jongsuk Hong (Seoul National University)
Topic:        N-body and Fokker-Planck simulations for rotating star clusters with
2-component models
Time:        12/25 (Tuesday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
To understand the effects of the initial rotation on the evolution of
the tidally limited clusters with mass spectrum, we have performed the N-body
simulations of the clusters with different initial rotations and compared the
results to those of the Fokker-Planck (FP) simulations. We confirmed that the cluster evolution is accelerated by not only the initial rotation but also the mass spectrum. For the slowly rotating models, the time evolutions of mass, energy and angular momentum show good agreements between N-body and FP simulations. On the other hand, for the rapidly rotating models, there are significant differences between these two approaches at the early stage of the evolution because of the bar instability in N-body simulations. shape of cluster for N-body simulations becomes tri-axial or even prolate, while the 2-dimensional FP simulation can treat only axisymmetric systems.
