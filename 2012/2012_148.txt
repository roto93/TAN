*** Special Seminar
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Kevin Walsh (Southwest Research Institute)
Topic:        The Grand Tack: Jupiter's migration to 1.5 AU, and how it shaped the inner solar system
Time:        8/23 (Thursday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
A persistent difficulty in terrestrial planet formation models is creating Mars analogs with the appropriate mass: Mars is typically an order of magnitude too large in simulations. A recent work found that a small Mars can be created if the planetesimal disk from which the planets form has an outermost edge at 1.0 AU. However, this work and no previous work, can explain such a truncation of the planetesimal disk and preserve the asteroid belt.  We show that gas-driven migration of Jupiter inward to 1.5 AU, before its subsequent outward migration, can truncate the disk and repopulate the asteroid belt. This dramatic migration history of Jupiter suggests that the dynamical behaviour of our giant planets was more similar to that inferred for extra-solar planets than previously thought, as both have been characterized by substantial radial migration.
