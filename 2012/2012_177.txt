Dear all,

Here is the 2nd circular of the HSC workshop. Now registration is  
open (Deadline is 25th Oct.). Hope many of us can contribute to this  
exciting workshop.

Regards,
  Youichi

Second Circular:
Workshop on SMBHs in the Universe: The Era of the HSC Surveys

-----------------------------------------------------
18--20 December 2012
Ehime University, Matsuyama, Japan
http://astro.edu.nagasaki-u.ac.jp/HSC-AGN2012/
-----------------------------------------------------

The formation and evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are
among the most exciting and challenging topics in astronomy and
astrophysics. New wide-field deep surveys are required to tackle
these issues, and Subaru's new wide-field camera (Hyper Suprime-Cam;
HSC) will bring promising opportunities to make breakthroughs in
this research field. Since the operation of HSC will start soon,
now it is a good time to have an intensive face-to-face discussion
among interested astronomers in the HSC collaboration (i.e., Japan,
Princeton, and Taiwan).

The main goals of this meeting are understanding the current status
of the HSC development and the strategy of the data analysis,
sharing scientific ideas on SMBH studies using the HSC data, and
promoting various collaborations on SMBH studies among the
researchers. We will focus on doing science and writing papers based
on the very early data of the coming HSC surveys. These discussions
in advance of the start of the HSC surveys will maximize the
scientific output in the theme of SMBH studies.

We will focus on the following topics, among others:
    -- Current status of the HSC hardware and software
    -- Survey plans and output photometric catalogs
    -- Quasar selection methods
    -- Statistics of quasars and SMBHs from the HSC data
    -- Co-evolution studies of SMBHs and galaxies with the HSC data
    -- Synergies of HSC and multi-wavelength data for SMBH studies
    -- Strategies for spectroscopic follow-up: Looking forward to PFS
    -- Theoretical preparations for HSC quasar surveys
    -- Action items for the HSC surveys

and we now call for oral and poster presentations that are related
to the topics given above. Please use the form attached at the end
of this circular for your registration and abstract submission (even
for people who would attend this meeting without any presentations),
and send it to the organization committee by email (send to:
agn2012@ioa.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp).
We may ask you to switch your presentation from oral to poster,
depending on the number of the presentation submissions.
The registration deadline is 25th October. The registration fee is
expected to be paid by cash at the registration desk during the
workshop. Though the price of the registration fee will be announced
in the next circular, we expect that it should be less than 5000 JPY.

This meeting will take place in Matsuyama, on Shikoku Island, about
a 2 hour flight from Tokyo. Matsuyama is famous for the Dogo-Onsen
hot spring, which is believed to be the oldest hot spring in Japan.
We have three days meetings (18-20 Dec.), and will close the meeting
around 3pm on 20 Dec.; then the participants can take an airplane to
Tokyo/Osaka in the evening on 20 Dec.
The travel info to Matsuyama is given in the workshop webpage
(http://astro.edu.nagasaki-u.ac.jp/HSC-AGN2012/). Please book your
hotel rooms by yourself; possible choices of convenient hotels are
also given in the workshop webpage. Please feel free to contact us
(agn2012@ioa.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp) if you have any problems in planning
your travel or finding your hotel rooms. Some cheep rooms in the
guesthouse of Ehime Univ. are also available (please see the workshop
webpage). We are looking forward to seeing you in Matsuyama!
