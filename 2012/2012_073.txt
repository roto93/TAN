> Subject: Third installment of Science Verification data of ALMA

Dear All,

The third installment of Science Verification data is now available. There 
are several new datasets in this release corresponding to targets 
suggested by the community and listed on the Science Verification web 
page.  We hope that you will find that the quality of these datasets is 
impressive, but please remember that ALMA is still in the construction 
phase, and we are continuously testing new observing modes.  These 
observations are made using new equipment and software and thus may 
contain more idiosyncrasies than data released to PIs in Early Science. 
There are data reduction suggestions for these datasets provided in the 
form of a script, as well as additional information about the dataset in a 
README file.

This installment of Science Verification data contains the following:

     BR1202-0725 at z=4.7: redshifted CII line in Band 7
     IRAS16293:  Band 6 observations centered on the CH3CN ladder and HNCO
     Centaurus A: a 48pt mosaic of the central parsecs in Band 6
     Orion KL: several tunings combined to provide a spectral survey in Band 6
