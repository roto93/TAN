 Subject: ALMA Cycle 0 status and SV data

Dear ALMA users,

There are two pieces of information in this message.

1. Cycle 0 status and the timeline for Cycle 1.

ALMA started scientific operations on 30 September 2011. While the quality
of the data being collected is excellent, the completion rate of projects is
lower than planned.  To increase the likelihood that most PIs of the highest
priority Cycle 0 projects will receive scientifically valuable data sets,
the Cycle 0 observing period will be extended until the end of 2012.  This
extension will not delay completion of the array.

The observatory plans to release information regarding the capabilities and
timeline for ALMA Early Science Cycle 1 in April 2012.  The proposal
deadline is expected to be in July 2012 with the start of Cycle 1
observations at the beginning of 2013.

2. Science Verification Data

The ALMA Observatory uses Science Verification (SV) to demonstrate
that ALMA data is valid, as compared to other existing similar data
taken by millimeter and submillimeter observatories, like the
Submillimeter Array (SMA).  ALMA has released SV data to the world
community already, and it will continue to do so.

Available released SV data and related information:
http://almascience.nao.ac.jp/alma-data/science-verification

Some of these data includes guidelines for the calibration and imaging parts.

The Taiwan ARC node reminds the Taiwanese community that is totally valid to
publish scientific results originated from the analysis of released SV data. 
The ARC strongly encourages the Taiwanese community to do so.

The following is an extract from the ALMA Observatory, please check the above 
link to get more information, as well as to download the data.

Using the data for publication

The following statement should be included in the acknowledgment of
papers using the datasets listed above: "The Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), an international astronomy
facility, is a partnership of Europe, North America and East Asia in
cooperation with the Republic of Chile. This paper makes use of the
following ALMA Science Verification data:
ADS/JAO.ALMA#2011.0.0000X.SV", where X=1 for the TW Hya dataset, X=2
for the NGC3256 dataset, X=3 for the Antennae mosaics, X=4 for M100
and X=5 for the SgrA* data.

Best Regards,
Chin-Fei
On behalf of the Taiwan ARC Node
