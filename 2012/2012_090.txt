First Circular EANAM 2012

The 5th East Asia Numerical Astrophysics Meeting
Oct. 29 -- Nov. 2, 2012, Yukawa Institute, Kyoto, Japan
http://www2.yukawa.kyoto-u.ac.jp/ws/2012/eanam5/index.html [2]

-----------------------------------------------------------

EANAM 2012 is the 5th meeting in the series of East Asia
Numerical Astrophysics (EANAM). EANAM has been held
bi-annually to stimulate numerical astrophysics in the
east Asia. Its scope encompasses research fields involving
numerical simulations of stars and planets on the small scale
to cosmological structures on the large scale. Topics will
include (but not limited to) the numerical astrophysics of
hydrodynamics, magnetohydrodynamics, radiative transfer,
particle acceleration, and numerical relativity. In addition,
there will also be a focus on computer science applications
directed toward astrophysics including numerical methods,
simulation data analysis, and high performance computing.
The program consists of tutorial lectures, invited talks,
contributed talks, and poster papers with brief oral
presentations. We welcome active postdocs and graduate students.

We call for contributed talks and posters. We encourage you to
register yourself at earliest convenience
through the conference web site,

  http://www2.yukawa.kyoto-u.ac.jp/ws/2012/eanam5/index.html [3]

We strongly recommend participants from outside Japan to
reserve a hotel room at earliest convenience. We have made
block reservation in several nearby hotels. However the
number of available rooms are limited. We will serve them
by the first come first served policy. Note that most
nearby hotels will be occupied by the end of summer since
the conference venue is close to many charming sight seeing
spots.

Financial Support:

A limited amount of financial support is available for those
who present either oral or poster papers. We give priority to
graduate students and young postdocs who do not have their
financial resources, according to the traditional policy in this
series of meetings. The financial support covers living expense
during the meeting not travel expense.

Accommodation:

Kyoto city has many hotels but most of them are fully occupied
during the meeting. We strongly recommend you to reserve your
rooms much in advance. Our web site gives you our recommendation
to you coming from abroad.

Important Dates:

Apr. 30 Opening of the registration
Aug. 31 Deadline for registration and visa application
Aug. 31 Deadline for abstract submission for contributed
  talks and poster papers
Sep. 30 Deadline for abstract submission for invited talks
Oct. 1 second circular (with science program)
Oct. 29 EANAM 2012

Registration Fee:
The registration fee is 10,000 JPN but 5,000 JPN for students.
This covers welcome reception (Oct. 29), conference dinner (Nov. 1),
and daily tea and coffee at breaks. We collect the registration
fee at the on site registration desk.

EANAM 2012 is sponsored by
Yukawa Institute for Theoretical Physics, Kyoto University
National Astronomical Observatory of Japan
HPCI Strategic Program Field 5

Further details are given at the conference web site.

We are looking forward to seeing you at Kyoto.
