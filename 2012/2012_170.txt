Dear Yi-Jehng, 

Could you please distribute this to TAN ? 
Thank you very much.

The Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics
(ASIAA<http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw>) in Taiwan, in cooperation with the
North American ALMA Science Center
(NAASC <https://safe.nrao.edu/wiki/bin/view/ALMA/NAASC>),
is pleased to announce the first ASIAA-NAASC joint ALMA workshop entitled:
"Transformational Science with ALMA: From Dust to Rocks to Planets - the
Formation and Evolution of Planetary Systems." This ASIAA-NAASC "2013
Rocks!" workshop will be held 8-12 April 2013 on the Big Island of Hawaii.
Pre-registration and abstract submission are now open.

Join your colleagues on the Big Island of Hawaii, April 8-12, 2013 to explore
the evolution of material in protostellar disks from formation to dissipation.
The Island of Hawai'i is home to the largest observatory in the Northern
Hemisphere, and is the site of extensive, collaborative, international research
efforts. A focus of the workshop will be the processing of the gas and dust
components, and the growth of planetesimals. We will also explore chemical
changes, and radiative signatures at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths.
We will showcase results from ALMA early science projects and feature synergies
with other telescopes that can help to advance this field, particularly those
sited on the island of Hawaii. This workshop will prepare us for the exciting
adventures ahead in the new era and will not only focus on the new opportunities
in astronomy but also foster new collaborations with geologists, chemists,
engineers and biologists to investigate the origins of cosmic material in the
universe. 

2013 Rocks! now begins accepting abstract submissions at 
https://science.nrao.edu/php/alma/rocks_abs.php. 

The deadline for submitting abstracts is November 15th. Make sure you visit the
meeting website at http://www.cv.nrao.edu/rocks/ for all relevant meeting 
information including links to the preregistration and abstract submission.
Also, remember to like us on Facebook <https://www.facebook.com/2013Rocks> in
order to get the most recent updates and announcements posted by the meeting
organizers and your colleagues. 

2013 Rocks! is committed to broadening participation by women and
