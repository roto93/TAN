Dear Colleagues,

The NTU Physics Department, Center for Condensed Matter Science, Institute
of Atomic and Molecular Sciences, and the Academia Sinica Institute of
Astronomy and Astrophysics invite everyone to our joint colloquium series.
The speakers are all famous international scholars and the colloquia are
aiming at a broad audience, including undergraduate students. Below is the
information of the talk on April 17(Tuesday). Please help to forward this
to the colleagues in your departments.

Speaker: Tai C. Chiang (=E6=B1=9F=E5=8F=B0=E7=AB=A0), UIUC
 Topic: From the Photoelectric Effect to Modern Photoemission Spectroscopy
Time: 04/17 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:10
Place: Chin-Pao Yang Lecture Hall (r104), CCM-New Physics Building

Abstract: The photoelectric effect was discovered in 1887 by Hertz. It was
explained in terms of photons in 1905 by Einstein, whose theory was
verified experimentally by Millikan in 1916. Einstein and Millikan each
received a Nobel prize in 1921 and 1923, respectively, for their work on
this effect. It was later realized that the photoelectric effect could be
used to probe the electronic structure of materials. Atoms in solids are
bound together by valence electrons, and the valence electronic structure
is key to materials properties. With the advent of ultrahigh vacuum
techniques and intense synchrotron radiation sources, photoemission has
become a powerful tool for condensed matter research. Today it is broadly
applied to essentially all materials and systems of interest, including
surfaces, thin films, nanoscale materials, complex oxides, superconductors,
strongly correlated systems, magnetic materials, graphene systems,
topological insulators, etc. This talk will include a brief historical
review of important milestones, selected examples of recent studies, and
some remarks about future prospects.

Brief Bio: Tai C. Chiang graduated from National Taiwan University in 1971,
obtained his PhD from Berkeley in 1978, and worked afterwards as a
postdoctoral associated at IBM for two years. Since 1980, he has been a
faculty member in the Department of Physics, University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign. He is currently serving as Scientific Director of the
Synchrotron Radiation Center, University of Wisconsin-Madison. His research
focuses on the electronic and atomic structures and growth behavior of
surfaces, thin films, multilayers, nanoscale systems, complex oxides,
graphene materials, and topological insulators, with an emphasis on quantum
size effects, electron-phonon coupling, spin-orbit coupling, electron
correlation, critical phenomena, and phase transitions. He is primarily an
experimentalist, employing tools such as angle-resolved photoemission, core
level spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction, thermal diffuse scattering, and
inelastic x-ray scattering, but he also performs model and first-principles
calculations in support of his experimental program.
