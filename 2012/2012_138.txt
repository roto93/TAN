Dear all,

Recently, ASIAA/Taiwan has joined the SPICA consortium, and will
contribute to the Mid-Infrared Spectrograph and Camera.

The SPICA mission has been reviewed by an international panel. The
panel issued a report on the various mission components, and a
response is expected. Thus, the SPICA MCS team will meet here at IAA
to obtain input on the response from the Taiwanese collaborators.

So, you are invited to a 2-day workshop on the SPICA MCS instrument at
IAA. A rough agenda is:

1 August 2012:
morning: presentations on SPICA MCS instrument, science cases,
Taiwanese contribution and the panel report
afternoon: discussion on how to address the panel report

2 August 2012:
morning: further discussion on how to address the panel report
afternoon: technical/instrumentation session

A more detailed agenda will be published as it becomes available.

For now, registration is opened for the meeting, with a deadline of 26
July. Please register at:

Best,
Ciska Kemper

The First Year of ALMA Science

The Joint ALMA Observatory announces that the international conference
"The First Year of ALMA science" will be held in Hotel Cumbres
Patagonicas, Puerto Varas, Chile on 12-15 December 2012.

ALMA Early Science operations started 30 September 2011. Over 100 high
science profile projects have been identified as high priority for
execution. The first exciting scientific results from Science
Verification datasets and Cycle 0 observations are coming out in
refereed journals since the beginning of 2012. At the end of the year,
the ALMA users community will be in a position to review the first
science results produced by this new and unique facility. The conference
will cover all the ALMA Science topics covered by Early Science
observations, from observations of the Solar System bodies to objects in
our own Galaxy, the local to high redshift Universe. While the
conference will obviously focused on ALMA observational results, we plan
to include presentations and discussions on related theoretical
implications and predictions as well as relevant complementary data from
other major facilities. The conference will also be an ideal venue to
discuss the scientific priorities for the ALMA development plan upgrades
in the context of the first results from Early Science.

To allow more ALMA users to propose contributions based on results from
their Cycle 0 projects we selected a late deadline for abstract
contributions on 27 Oct 2012.

Important deadlines (all 2012)

Registration opens: 1 June
Abstracts deadline: 27 Oct
Contributed talks selection: 16 Nov
Conference dates: 12 â€“ 15 Dec
Conference website: http://www.almasc.org/2012
Conference email: asc2012@almanospam.example.cl (remove nospam.example)

This conference is co-sponsored by the Joint ALMA Observatory and the
ALMA partners (ESO, NAOJ and NRAO) with additional support provided by
the EC-FP7 Radionet3 project.

Dear Yi-Jehng,

    I guess you have received the same announcement, too. Could you =
help putting it on TAN for circulation? The abstract submission deadline =
is next week (July 31). Thanks!
