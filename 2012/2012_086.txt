Dear Colleagues,

The NTU Physics Department, Center for Condensed Matter Science, Institute
of Atomic and Molecular Sciences, the Academia Sinica Institute of
Astronomy and Astrophysics, and Leung Center for Cosmology and Particle
Astrophysics invite everyone to our joint colloquium series. The speakers
are all famous international scholars and the colloquia are aiming at a
broad audience, including undergraduate students. Below is the information
of the talk on May 8(Tuesday). Please help to forward this to the
colleagues in your departments.

Best Regards,
Chih-Wei Chang (CCMS)
Pisin Chen (LeCosPA)
Yee Hsiung (NTU Physics)
Yu-Ju Lin (IAMS)
Michihiro Takami (ASIAA)

Speaker: Roger Blandford, SLAC
Topic: Higher Energy Astrophysics
Time: 05/08 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:30
Place: Chin-Pao Yang Lecture Hall (r104), CCMS-New Physics Building

Abstract: Astronomical observations have demonstrated that cosmic sources
are capable of accelerating protons and electrons to unexpectedly large
energies with surprisingly high efficiency. Supernova remnants accelerate
protons and electrons to nearly a thousand times the energy produced by
terrestrial particle accelerators and unspecified, but cosmologically local
sources achieve proton energies nearly a million times greater than this.
Recent observations by the Auger, Chandra, Fermi, H.E.S.S., MAGIC and
VERITAS telescopes will be briefly summarized and it will be argued that
novel particle acceleration mechanisms are at work.

Brief Bio: Roger Blandford is a native of England and took his BA, MA and
PhD degrees at Cambridge University. Following postdoctoral research at
Cambridge, Princeton and Berkeley he took up a faculty position at Caltech
in 1976 where he was appointed as the Richard Chace Tolman Professor of
Theoretical Astrophysics. In 2003 He moved to Stanford University to become
the first Director of the Kavli Institute of Particle Astrophysics and
Cosmology and the Luke Blossom Chair in the School of Humanities and
Science. His research interests include black hole astrophysics, cosmology,
gravitational lensing, cosmic ray physics and compact stars. He is a Fellow
of the Royal Society and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and a
Member of the National Academy of Science.

Speaker: Chang C. Tsuei (=B1Z=B3=B9=B5X), IBM
Topic: Topological Nature of Superconducting =A3k-loops
Time: 05/08 (Tuesday) 15:40 - 16:50
Place: Chin-Pao Yang Lecture Hall (r104), CCMS-New Physics Building

Abstract: The recent discovery of topological insulators and topological
superconductors has inspired numerous approaches to searching for the
elusive Majorana fermions in various condensed matter systems for potential
applications in topological quantum computing.
    In this talk, we will show that the time-reversed doubly degenerate
half flux quantum states in a d-wave superconductor-based =A3k-loop are
topologically protected by a parity effect arising from an odd number of
sign changes of the supercurrent circulating in the loop. The existence and
stability of Majorana zero modes bound to the half flux quantum vortex will
be discussed.
