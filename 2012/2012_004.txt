Dear all, below is the information for upcoming special colloquium at IANCU;

Title: Optical and NIR polarimetric studies towards star-forming regions
Speaker: Dr. Chakali Eswaraiah (ARIES, Nainial, INDIA.)
Date: 2012-01-03
Time: 15:00-16:00
Location: NCU, S4-1013
Abstract:

Linear polariemetric observations in optical and near-infrared wavelengths are useful
tools to study the dust grain properties as well as to map the magnetic field
orientation towards various Galactic environments especially towards the star-forming
and molecular cloud regions. We have demonstrated that the Stokes plane in combination
with optical color-color diagram can efficiently be used to identify the probable
members of star clusters. Since young-stellar-objects (YSOs) with circumstellar material
exhibit either intrinsic polarization or rotation in their polarization angles,
consequently show scattered distribution in the stokes plane. The stokes plane can also
be used to identify the YSOs. In this talk, I will present our recent results based on
optical polarimetric observations of three star-forming regions NGC1893, Berkeley 59,
NGC1931 and one isolated molecular cloud core B227. I will also present preliminary
results for Carina Nebula and RCW57 based on NIR polarimetric observations.

*** Colloquium

Speaker:	Tony Wong (University of Illinois)
Topic:		Molecular Clouds in the Large Magellanic Cloud
Time:		1/6 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:		 R1203
Abstract:
With the Magellanic Mopra Assessment (MAGMA), we have recently 
completed a CO imaging survey of the most luminous giant molecular 
clouds (GMCs) in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) with the Mopra 
mm-wave telescope.  In this talk I will describe recent progress in 
deepening our understanding of GMC evolution using CO surveys of the 
LMC.  Molecular gas is found in regions with high gas columns, but 
high gas columns do not guarantee CO detection.  The inferred 
properties of the GMCs depend a great deal on the analysis technique, 
and the expected size-linewidth correlation only becomes apparent on 
large scales. The velocity gradients across GMCs are similar to those 
found in the surrounding atomic gas and do not appear indicative of 
rotation.  Examining the CO detection statistics towards candidate 
young stellar objects (YSOs), we find that more luminous YSOs are more 
likely to show detectable CO emission.  Conversely, more luminous GMCs 
are more likely to contain YSOs.  On the other hand, the virial 
parameter of a GMC has little influence on whether it is likely to 
exhibit massive star formation.  Our results support a tight linkage 
between molecular gas and star formation but call into question the 
assumption that GMCs are gravitationally bound (and thus long-lived) 
entities.

Dear all, below is the information for upcoming colloquium at IANCU:

Title: Identification campaign of supernova remnant candidates in the Milky Way: Chandra
observation of G308.3-1.4
Speaker: Dr. Regina Huang (NTHU Astronomy)
Date: 2012-01-06
Time: 14:00-15:00
Location: NCU, S4-1013
Abstract:

ROSAT all-sky survey data have provided another window to search for supernova remnants
(SNRs). In reexamining this data archive, a list of unidentified extended X-ray objects
have been suggested as promising SNR candidate. However, most of these targets have not
yet been fully explored by the state-of-art X-ray observatories. For selecting a pilot
target for a long-term identification campaign, we have observed the brightest
candidate, G308.3-1.4, with Chandra X-ray observatory. An incomplete shell-like X-ray
structure which well-correlated with the radio shell emission at 843 MHz has been
revealed. The X-ray spectrum suggests the presence of a shock-heated plasma. The
brightest X-ray point source detected in this field-of-view is also the one locates
closest to the geometrical center of G308.3-1.4, which has a soft spectrum. The
intriguing temporal variability and the identification of optical/infrared counterpart
rule out the possibility of an isolated neutron star. Together with a putative
periodicity of ~1.4 hrs, the interesting excesses in the V-, B- bands, and H-alpha
suggest this source as a promising candidate of a compact binary survived in a supernova
explosion.
