Dear Colleagues,

You are cordially invited to attend the Joint Colloquium
which will be held on November 13.
The Joint Colloquium Series is organized by
the NTU Physics Department, Center for Condensed Matter Science (CCMS),
Leung Center for Cosmology and Particle Astrophysics (LeCosPA),
Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA),
and the Institute of Atomic and Molecular Sciences (IAMS).
The idea is to have excellent speakers to give inspiring, informative,
but non-technical talks on the frontiers of Sciences.

Enclosed below is the information of the Joint Colloquium on November 13.

Best regards,

Pisin Chen (LeCosPA)
Ting-Wai Chiu (NTU-Phys)
Michitoshi Hayashi (CCMS)
Lain-Jong Li (IAMS)
Michihiro Takami (ASIAA)

Abstract :
    In your mobile phones, there are two kinds of important devices,  
billions of transistors and a battery. The transistor controls  
electron flow in a semiconductor to enable processing and storage of  
information, while the latter stores electrochemical energy for  
driving the former. In the latest decade, devices with combined  
concepts of transistors and batteries, electrochemical transistors,  
are receiving increasing interests, because they can offer new  
opportunities beyond conventional current switching functions of all  
solid transistors.
    One of surprises comes from a simple replacement of solid gate  
dielectrics in field effect transistors (FETs) with electrolytes,  
which produces an innovative concept of field effect phase control in  
a variety of materials, including superconductors, ferromagnets, Mott  
insulators, and even metals. Current status of emergent “iontronics”,  
electronics based on ionic functions, will be reviewed.
