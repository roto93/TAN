Dear all, upcoming Colloquium at IANCU (S4-Room 1013) is:


Title: Current-Driven Kink Instability in Magnetically Dominated Relativistic Jet
Speaker: Dr. Yosuke Mizuno (NTHU Astronomy)

Time: 14:00-15:00
Location: NCU, S4-1013
Abstract:

Relativistic jets have been observed or postulated in various astrophysical sources,
including active galactic nuclei (AGNs), microquasars in the galaxy and gamma-ray bursts
(GRBs). There are four major problems related to the relativistic jets: 1. formation
mechanism, 2. acceleration mechanism, 3. collimation mechanism, and 4.long-term
stability. The most promising mechanisms for producing and accelerating relativistic
jets, and maintaining collimated structure of relativistic jets involve
magnetohydrodynamical processes. We have investigated the temporal development of
current-driven (CD) kink instability in magnetically dominated relativistic jets via 3D
relativistic MHD simulations. In this investigation a static force-free equilibrium
helical magnetic configuration is considered in order to study the influence of the
initial configuration on the linear and nonlinear evolution of the instability. We found
that the initial configuration is strongly distorted but not disrupted by the CD kink
instability. The linear growth and nonlinear evolution of the CD kink instability
depends moderately on the radial density profile and strongly on the magnetic pitch
profile. We also present the influence of velocity shear surface on the temporal
development of the CD kink instability.
