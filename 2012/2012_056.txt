Dear Yi-Jehng,

	Please find below the reminder about early registration deadline for ASROC2012 in both English and Chinese. Please pass it to the ASROC members and/or distribute it through TAN, if appropriate.
	Thanks!

best,
sheng-yuan

----------
Dear colleagues,

	This is to remind you that the early registration deadline for ASROC2012 is approaching in three days!

	The ASROC2012 (2012 Scientific Assembly of the Astronomical Society of the Republic of China) is to be held at National Taitung University on May 25-27, 2012, and you are cordially invited to participate.

	Given the remote location of the meeting, the organizing committee will help making group reservations for the round-trip train tickets between Taipei and Taitung. The Taiwan Railways requires group reservations to be made two months prior to the trip. Thus, if you would like to take advantage of our service, your cooperation to register before March 23 (Friday) is very important.

	Information about the lodging and half-day tour is available now on the meeting website, and the abstract submission interface will be online in a day or two. The abstract submission deadline is April 27, about another month from now.

	For the 2nd circular and more detailed information, please visit the ASROC2012 meeting website at
       http://www.asroc.org.tw/asroc2012/index.php

	Thank you for your attention, and we look forward to seeing you at the meeting!

Sheng-Yuan Liu, on behalf of the ASROC2012 LOC

Dear all, below is the information for upcoming colloquium at IANCU:

Title: Superluminous Supernovae
Speaker: Dr. Robert Quimby (IPMU)
Date: 2012-03-23
Time: 14:00-15:00
Location: NCU, S4-1013
Abstract

Not long ago the sample of well studied supernovae, which were gathered mostly through
targeted surveys, was populated exclusively by events with absolute peak magnitudes
fainter than about -20. Modern searches that select supernovae not just from massive
hosts but from dwarfs as well have produced a new census with a surprising difference: a
significant percentage of supernovae found in these flux limited surveys peak at -21
magnitude or brighter. The energy emitted by these superluminous supernovae in optical
light alone rivals the total explosion energy available to typical core collapse
supernovae (>10^51 ergs). This makes superluminous supernovae difficult to explain
through standard models. Adding further complexity to this picture are the distinct
observational properties of various superluminous supernovae. Some may be powered in
part by interactions with a hydrogen-rich, circumstellar material but others appear to
lack hydrogen altogether. Some appear to be powered by large stores of radioactive
material, while others fade quickly and have stringent limits on 56-Ni production. In
this talk I will discuss the current observational constrains on superluminous supernova
and the prospects for revealing their origins.

Applications are invited for two postdoctoral fellowships in the area of
philosophy of
cosmology, one to be held at Cambridge University and one to be held at
Oxford
University, starting 1 Jan 2013 to run until 31 Aug 2014. The two
positions have similar job-descriptions and the deadline for applications
is the same: 18 April 2012.

For more details, see, for the Cambridge fellowship:
http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/vacancy/
and for the Oxford fellowship:
https://www.recruit.ox.ac.uk/pls/hrisliverecruit/erq_jobspec_version_4.jobspec?p_id=102536

Applicants are encouraged to apply for both positions. The Oxford group is
led by Joe
Silk, Simon Saunders and David Wallace, and that at Cambridge by John
Barrow and Jeremy Butterfield.

These appointments are part of the initiative 'establishing the philosophy
of
cosmology', involving a consortium of universities in the UK and USA,
funded by the John
Templeton Foundation. Its aim is to identify, define and explore new
foundational
questions in cosmology. Key questions already identified concern:

*       The issue of measure, including potential uses of anthropic
reasoning
*       Space-time structure, both at very large and very small scales
*       The cosmological constant problem
*       Entropy, time and complexity, in understanding the various arrows
of time
*       Symmetries and invariants, and the nature of the description of
the universe as
a whole

Applicants with philosophical interests in cosmology outside these areas
will also be
considered.
