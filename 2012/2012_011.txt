Topic:        The Initial Conditions for Gravitational Collapse of Star-Forming Molecular Cloud Core
Time:        1/19 (Thursday) 16:00 - 17:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
Without accurate knowledge of the initial conditions of gravitational collapsing process 
of a molecular cloud core, one cannot understand how a low-mass protostar forms. 
One of the major limiting factors is that the initial conditions of core collapse are not 
necessarily revealed by observations in detail. In this context, we performed a study of 
the natal molecular cloud core and its environment. The core is believed to harbor an 
extremely young low-mass protostar that has not generated an extensive molecular outflow, 
yielding a rare opportunity to investigate core-collapsing process free from the disturbance 
by the outflow. Our observations suggest that the gas in the molecular cloud core is infalling
onto the protostar, and that the non-thermal velocity dispersions, tracing the ambient 
turbulent velocity fields, in the medium-density gas are clearly smaller than those in 
the low-density gas. We discuss these results with comparisons of theoretical models 
and the implications for initial conditions of star formation in general.
