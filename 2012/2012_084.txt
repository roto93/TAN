Dear All,

  I not only echo Wei-Shu's comments but just realized with surprise that
there will be two colloquiums back-to-back next Tuesday and Blandford's
talk is now scheduled at 15:30-16:30, for which I was never informed (as
the person in charge of the invitation). This schedule unfortunately would
not work for Blandford, for he needs to leave our campus at 16:00 to catch
the flight at 18:15. I have told him that his colloquium was at
14:20-15:30, our standard schedule and promised him that there would be
sufficient time for him to catch the flight. This conflict must be resolved
today.

  By the way, I understand that the 4-way Joint Colloquium has now formally
include LeCosPA as a co-organizer into a 5-way enterprise. Somehow this
announcement did not reflect that fact.

  Best regards,

Pisin
