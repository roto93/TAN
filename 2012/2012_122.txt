> Subject: Specifics for ALMA users in Taiwan

Dear Potential ALMA users in Taiwan,

A PI in Taiwan has access to ALMA through both East Asia (EA) and North 
America (NA) regions. He/She can register in the ALMA Science Portal. 
After registration, the user can select freely (and also can change it) to 
which region the time should be charged to. Also for submitting Helpdesk 
tickets, both regions can be selected. Accordingly, and since as a rule, 
ALMA users should have only a single account. If you have two accounts, 
you should have received a email informing you that the two accounts would 
be merged. If they are not merged automatically, please remove one or 
submit a Helpdesk ticket. With the account, you should be able to see a 
drop-down menu in Observing Tool (OT) for you to select which region to 
submit your proposal. If you don't see the drop-down menu in OT, then you 
may need to reset/update your institution in your profile in the science 
portal.

In Cycle 1, a PI in Taiwan can also have a 50/50 split option for time 
charge. To facilitate the explanation, here we assume some one submits a 
proposal with this split option, and requests a total time of 10 hrs, 
i.e., 5 hrs in EA and 5 hrs in NA.

If one selects the split option, it depends on where the proposal stands 
in BOTH queues. For the proposal to be accepted, it needs to fit within 
BOTH queues; i.e., for the above proposal submitted for Cycle 1, the 5 hrs 
needs to fit within the NA 270 hr allotment and the other 5 hrs needs to 
fit within the EA 180 hr allotment. If it only fits within one queue and 
not the other, it will not be given a "High Priority" status.

Note that this is not necessarily a double jeopardy; it depends on the 
relative over-subscription between the two regions, and how close to the 
dividing line the proposal lies. Not obvious for the example of a 10 hrs 
proposal; more-so for larger proposals where e.g. fitting 20 hrs into two 
queues is easier than fitting 40hrs into one.

On the other hand, a Taiwanese PI can submit two 5hr proposals SEPARATELY, 
one with EA as the Executive, another with NA as the Executive. Then each 
part would be judged against the relevant queue, - they get all the time 
if they pass both Executives cutoff; they get 5 hrs if they only pass one 
Executives cutoff.

Note that this workflow would only work for projects that could be split 
by number of targets, not total integration time, since there is a 
prohibition against submitting the exact same proposal with different 
Executive affiliations.
