*** Colloquium

Speaker:    Anthony Gonzalez (University of Florida)
Topic:        Galaxy Clusters at z=1-2: An Infrared View
Time:        10/5 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
While the galaxy cluster population at z<1 has long been accessible, only in recent years has it become possible to identify and study statistical cluster samples in the redshift regime z=1-2. This era is of particular interest because it is expected to be the formation epoch for the first massive galaxy clusters and also provides a direct view of the cluster galaxy population during a period of significant star formation and mass assembly. In this talk I will describe a series of surveys based upon Spitzer and WISE data that are designed to identify large samples of clusters at these redshifts, complementing the new generation of Sunyaev-Zel'dovich surveys. I will also present recent results, including a few surprises, from detailed follow-up studies of a subset of these clusters with HST, Spitzer, and ground-based facilities.
