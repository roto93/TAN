Topic:        The Stony Brook/SMARTS Atlas of (mostly) Southern Novae: New Clues to the Physics of Exploding Stars
Time:        8/3 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
The Stony Brook/SMARTS Atlas of (mostly) Southern Novae now consists of
spectroscopic and photometric observations of 57 novae in our galaxy and
4 in the LMC, amassed since the fall of 2003. The reason for collecting all
these data, the largest specto-photometric survey of galactic novae, is to
facilitate study of their evolution on both long and short terms.
Novae are among the most complex phenomena in the universe: a detailed
synoptic study of a large number of novae is needed to to make
sense of the broad range of observed characteristics.

After a brief review of the characteristics of novae (thermonuclear
explosions on the surfaces of accreting white dwarfs), I will present an
overview of the atlas.
The bulk of the talk will concentrate on three science questions that
have arisen based on examination of these data:

1). In novae that eventually develop strong supersoft X-ray emission, there
is a spectral progression wherein first the N III 4640A lines grow, followed
by the growth of He II 4686, which the fades as the X-rays turn on. The N III
lines are pumped by the Bowen Fluorescence mechanism, which is active in
planetary nebulae, cataclysmic variables, and low mass X-ray binaries.
Whereas these oresent more-or-less steady state situations, in the novae these
lines are formed in a dynamic expanding envelope. I will discuss some
premininary thoughts about the time-dependent problem.

2). The emission line profiles of the recurrent novae and the He-N novae
are unlike those of the classical (Fe II) novae, and instead resemble
what one might expect from an optically-thin disk in Keplerian rotation
around the white dwarf. I shall present and discuss the evolution of
these line profiles, and will show that the spectral evolution is
consistent with the rapid re-establishment of the accretion disk after
(or survival through) the nova explosion.

3). The star V Sge has been enigmatic for decades. It shows broad eclipses,
and high excitation (C IV, N V, O VI) optical lines atop a blue continuum.
It has been variously explained as a nova-like variable (i.e., a hot
accretion disk), a massive white dwarf undergoing steady surface nuclear
burning, a Wolf-rayet system, or two non-degenerate stars in a contact
configuration. After 4 years, one of our novae has taken on the
appearance of a V Sge star, with broad eclipses and hot permitted line
emission, while another show a similar spectrum. Knowing where they came from
will give clues to the real nature of the V Sge stars.

Speaker:    Patrice Theule (University of Provence)
Topic:        chemistry in interstellar ices
Time:        7/30 (Monday) 15:30 - 16:30
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
I would like to present my research activities and recent results on interstellar ice chemistry. I will present laboratory studies of chemical reaction in ice analogues, and will show how laboratory studies enable to build a chemical reactions network that can be transposed to interstellar grain chemistry.
