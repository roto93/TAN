Dear All,


Here we are sending you the 3rd announcement of the 2013 ASIAA-NAASC ALMA workshop, which will be held
in Kona, Hawaii, on 8 - 12 April, 2013. The deadline of the abstract submission is coming very soon, Dec. 31, 2012.
We urge you to submit abstracts.


Sincerely,
Shigehisa Takakuwa, on behalf of LOC

The Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics
(ASIAA<http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw>) in Taiwan and the North American ALMA
Science Center (NAASC <https://safe.nrao.edu/wiki/bin/view/ALMA/NAASC>) are
pleased to announce the first ASIAA-NAASC joint ALMA workshop entitled:
¡§Transformational Science with ALMA: From Dust to Rocks to Planets
¡V the Formation and Evolution of Planetary Systems." This ASIAA-NAASC
"2013 Rocks!" workshop will be held 8-12 April 2013 on the Big Island of Hawaii.
The deadline for submitting abstracts is coming very soon, December 31. For
those who are interested in this workshop, please visit our website at
http://www.cv.nrao.edu/rocks/ now, and complete the preregistration and
abstract submission by the deadline. Also, remember to like us on Facebook
<https://www.facebook.com/2013Rocks> in order to get the most recent updates
and announcements posted by the meeting organizers and your colleagues.

Join your colleagues on the Big Island of Hawaii, April 8-12, 2013 to explore
the evolution of material in protostellar disks from formation to dissipation.
The Island of Hawai'i is home to the largest observatory in the Northern
Hemisphere, and is the site of extensive, collaborative, international
research efforts. A focus of the workshop will be the processing of the gas and
dust components, and the growth of planetesimals. We will also explore chemical
changes, and radiative signatures at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths.
We will showcase results from ALMA early science projects and feature synergies
with other telescopes that can help to advance this field, particularly those
sited on the island of Hawaii. This workshop will prepare us for the exciting
adventures ahead in the new era and will not only focus on the new opportunities
in astronomy but also foster new collaborations with geologists, chemists,
engineers and biologists to investigate the origins of cosmic material in the
universe.

2013 Rocks! is committed to broadening participation by women and
under-represented minorities.

*The 4th APCosPA Winter School/Workshop on Cosmology and Particle
Astrophysics*

*21 January 2013 - 1 February 2013*
*Department of Physics, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan*
          The pace of the advancement in the area of Cosmology and Particle
Astrophysics (CosPA) is amazedly fast since the new century. The
researchers in the Asia Pacific region, including Australia, China, Hawaii,
Japan, Korea, New Zealand, and Taiwan, have played their due roles in
making the progresses. To make our marks more noticeable, we have formed
the Asia Pacific Organization for Cosmology and Particle Astrophysics
(APCosPA Organization) on 1 January 2011.

          One beginning was to hold the First APCosPA Winter School in
January 2010, at National Taiwan University, Taipei. We intend to cover the
various topics in Cosmology and Particle Astrophysics but mainly toward the
graduate students and young researchers.

          Each lecturer would give two to three lectures, with a couple of
hard problems. And the registered students or young postdocs could enter
the competitions with the awards given to the first few “students ”.
          In 2013, we invite, as special APCosPA visitors, Nobel laureate
George Smoot to visit us while, in 2014, another Nobel Laureate Brian
Schmidt. Although there may be no overlap with the school period, it is
interesting to keep that in mind.

President, APCosPA Org.
