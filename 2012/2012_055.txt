Applications are invited for two postdoctoral fellowships in the area of
philosophy of
cosmology, one to be held at Cambridge University and one to be held at
Oxford
University, starting 1 Jan 2013 to run until 31 Aug 2014. The two
positions have similar job-descriptions and the deadline for applications
is the same: 18 April 2012.

For more details, see, for the Cambridge fellowship:
http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/vacancy/
and for the Oxford fellowship:
https://www.recruit.ox.ac.uk/pls/hrisliverecruit/erq_jobspec_version_4.jobspec?p_id=102536

Applicants are encouraged to apply for both positions. The Oxford group is
led by Joe
Silk, Simon Saunders and David Wallace, and that at Cambridge by John
Barrow and Jeremy Butterfield.

These appointments are part of the initiative 'establishing the philosophy
of
cosmology', involving a consortium of universities in the UK and USA,
funded by the John
Templeton Foundation. Its aim is to identify, define and explore new
foundational
questions in cosmology. Key questions already identified concern:

*       The issue of measure, including potential uses of anthropic
reasoning
*       Space-time structure, both at very large and very small scales
*       The cosmological constant problem
*       Entropy, time and complexity, in understanding the various arrows
of time
*       Symmetries and invariants, and the nature of the description of
the universe as
a whole

Applicants with philosophical interests in cosmology outside these areas
will also be
considered.
