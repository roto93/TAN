> Subject: Reminders and Notes for ALMA Cycle 1 Proposal Call

Dear Potential ALMA users,

Here are some reminders and notes.

1. The deadline for ALMA Cycle 1 proposal call is July 12.

2. Once the proposal is validated within the OT, it can be submitted to the
ALMA Archive.  Note that the proposal can be resubmitted by the Principal
Investigator as many times as needed before the proposal deadline.

3. The English Editor, Lucy, will come to IAA from 1pm to 5pm on July 5 (RM
1023) and July 12 (RM 1108).  Please talk to her if you need any help
polishing your proposals.

4. On the ALMA-T website, we posted a trouble shooting page about the issues
of helpdesk, executive in OT, and incorrect time estimation in CASA 3.4 in
bands 9 and 10:

We will update the page for any issues that you need to know for writing
your proposals

Best Wishes,
Chin-Fei
On behalf of T-ARC node
