*** Special Seminar

Speaker:    Ryosuke Asano (Nagoya University)
Topic:        Evolution of grain size distribution in galaxies
Time:        12/17 (Monday) 15:30 - 16:30
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
Dust in galaxies affects the various evolutionary properties of
galaxies, like star
formation and spectral energy distribution (SED) of galaxies, etc.
Furthermore, these
effects depend strongly on the grain size distribution in galaxies as
well as the amount of dust.
Both the total dust mass and the grain size distribution in galaxies are
affected by various processes.
These processes occur in galaxies ubiquitously, and they depend strongly
on the metallicity,
the size distribution of grains. Hence, it is crucial to consider all
dust processes in a unified framework
to understand the evolution of the evolution of the total dust mass and
the grain size distribution in galaxies.
We construct a dust evolution model taking into account the grain size
distribution and investigate the evolution of the distribution in
galaxies. We consider three processes as follows: (1) dust destruction
by supernova (SN)
shocks, (2) metal accretion onto the grain surface in the interstellar
medium (ISM)
(3) grain-grain collisions in turbulence (shattering and coagulation).
In this talk, I will introduce our dust evolution model, show the
evolution of grain size distribution obtained by our model, and discuss
what process is the dominant source of the grain size distribution at
every stage of galaxy evolution.
