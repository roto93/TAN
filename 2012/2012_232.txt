  Title: Modeling Magnetic Fields in Protostellar Cores
        from Interferometeric Polarization Measurements

      Tea/Discussion Time is followed in the same room.
                  All Welcome !!

Abstract:
We compare high-angular resolution observations of submillimeter
dust polarization of NGC1333 IRAS 4A with empirical density and
magnetic field models in protostellar cores. With the assumptions of
constant dust property and small dust alignment efficiency, we compute
the Stokes I,Q, and U maps of the empirical models and convolve them with 
interferometer responses to generate polarization maps. The best-fit
density model is obtained with comparisons of modeled and observed Stokes 
I visibilities, and the goodness of magnetic field models is evaluated by 
the residuals between the polarization angles on the modeled and
observed maps. The effects of viewing angle are also tested in our 
simulations. Our results show that hourglass structures alone
cannot reproduce the depolarization effect in NGC1333 IRAS 4A if the 
inclination angle is indeed as small as what have been inferred
from the outflow line-of-sight velocity and proper motions. Our analysis 
suggests that the magnetic fields of NGC1333 IRAS 4A might have
an hourglass structure at scales of few hundred AU along with a smaller 
toroidal component around the protostars. The modified field geometry is 
in agreement with the theoretical expectation of rotating magnetized
collapsing cores.
