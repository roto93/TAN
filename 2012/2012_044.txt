Dear colleagues,

     First Announcement of the 3rd Fermi Asian Network (FAN) Workshop

     http://heastro.cnu.ac.kr/fan3.htm

    On behalf of the SOC, I am pleased to announce that the 3rd Fermi
Asian Network (FAN) Workshop
will be held in Chungnam National University, Daejeon, South Korea in
the period of 20-24 June 2012.

    FAN was established in 2012 to promote the collaborations among
the high energy astrophysicists
in Asia, with particular focus on using the data obtained by Fermi
Gamma-ray Space Telescope for
observational and theoretical investigations. The FAN collaboration
currently consists of astrophysicists
mainly from Taiwan, Hong Kong and Korea. Over the last two years, we
have published a series of papers
on various topics related to compact objects and their environment.

This workshop will be focused on the following topics:

* Rotation-powered pulsars & their wind nebulae
* Magnetars
* Gamma-ray binaries
* Supernova remnants
* Galactic center
* AGN
* Gamma-ray transients
* Unidentified Fermi objects

Apart from the formal presentations, this workshop will also emphasize
on the round-table discussion so as
to facilitate further collaborations. We will also hold a mini
hands-on training course to help student and postdocs
to analyze Fermi data.

However, such format cannot accommodate a large group. Thus the total
number of participants will be limited to about 30.

Invited Speakers:
Alice Harding (NASA Goddard Space Flight Center)
Paul Ray (Navy Research Laboratory)
Jun Kataoka (Waseda University)
Wim Hermsen (SRON-Netherlands Institute for Space Research)

Registration:
There is no registration fee and everyone is invited to participate in
this workshop.
Accommodation support (on sharing basis) for overseas students will be
provided. Participants are
encourage to make contributed talks related to the workshop.
Coffee/tea break will be provided throughout
the workshop. We will also arrange an excursion+conference dinner on 22 June.

Please visit http://heastro.cnu.ac.kr/fan3.htm for registration. The
deadline is on 30 April.

Accommodation:
Block-booked accommodation will be provided in Hotel Interciti
http://www.hotelinterciti.com/
which locates at a ~20 min walking distance from CNU campus. Shuttle
bus will be arranged to take the participants
from the hotel to the workshop venue in the morning and and back to
the hotel in the evening.
Accommodation support can be provided for the nights from 19 June to 24 June.

The workshop is sponsored by the National Research Foundation of Korea
and Chungnam National University.

I am looking forward to meeting you in Daejeon.

With best regards,
David Hui
