Dear Colleagues,

You are cordially invited to attend the Joint Colloquium
which will be held on November 20.
The Joint Colloquium Series is organized by
the NTU Physics Department, Center for Condensed Matter Science (CCMS),
Leung Center for Cosmology and Particle Astrophysics (LeCosPA),
Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA),
and the Institute of Atomic and Molecular Sciences (IAMS).
The idea is to have excellent speakers to give inspiring, informative,
but non-technical talks on the frontiers of Sciences.

Enclosed below is the information of the Joint Colloquium on November 20.

Best regards,

Pisin Chen (LeCosPA)
Ting-Wai Chiu (NTU-Phys)
Michitoshi Hayashi (CCMS)
Lain-Jong Li (IAMS)
Michihiro Takami (ASIAA)

ASIAA/CCMS/IAMS/LeCosPA/NTU-Physics Joint Colloquium
Speaker: Prof. Xiao Gang He(何小剛 教授)
        (Physics Department, NTU)
        (Head of NCTS Physics Division)
Topic: The HMW Topological Phase
Time: 11/20 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:10
Place: Room 104, CCMS-New Physics Building

Brief Bio. :
    Professor He is currently on leave from NTU, serving as the head  
of the NCTS Physics Division. He has been a distinguished professor at  
NTU since 2008. In 1982, He graduated from University of Science and  
Technology in China, and earned a CUSPEA fellowship to further his  
graduate studies in the University of Hawaii and graduated in 1987  
with a Ph.D degree. After working at various institutions, he joined  
NTU in 1998 and became a full professor in 1999.
    Professor He has been conducting researches in particle physics,  
quantum mechanics and cosmology, and has published more than 160 SCI  
research papers. His major achievements include: Systematic studies of  
new physics the neutron electric dipole moment in the standard model  
and beyond (1987, 1989); first proposed the Type III seesaw model  
(1989); first discovered the He-McKellar-Wilkens phase (1992); first  
discovered the importance of electroweak penguin in the studies of B  
decays and CP violation; and independently proposed the trib-maximal  
mixing and associated modifications (2003, 2006). In recent years, he  
has been studying the dark matter, and Higgs physics related to LHC.

Abstract :
    Quantum mechanics predicts the existence of topological phase in  
interference phenomena. One of the most famous examples is the AB  
phase predicted by Aharonov and Bohm in 1959. It has been shown that  
there are several classes of topological phases involving  
electromagnetic interactions. In 1993, He and McKellar predicted the  
existence of a topological phase due to a particle with an electric  
dipole moment moving in a closed path which encloses a finite magnetic  
monopole density. A year later Wilkens also obtained the same result.  
This phase is called the HMW phase. This phase does not depend on how  
the path encloses the monopole density and therefore a topological  
one. Recently, it has been claimed that this phase has been observed  
in atom interferometry experiment. In this talk I will discuss in  
details the HMW phase and the experimental efforts to measure it.
