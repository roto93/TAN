*** Colloquium
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:	Dr. Takaya Nozawa (IPMU)
Topic:		Dust Production by Various Types of Supernovae
Time:		12/2 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:		 R1203
Abstract:
Supernovae (SNe) have been thought to be major sources of interstellar
dust. I will introduce a series of our works on dust formation in the ejecta
of SNe and dust destruction by the shocks penetrating into SN remnants.
I demonstrate how the mass of dust ejected from SNe to the interstellar
medium depend on the types of SNe, showing that envelope-stripped
SNe such as Type IIb/Ib/Ia are likely to be minor sources of dust.. I also
mention the difference in estimates of dust mass formed in SNe between
theory and observation, and describe that this difference is now getting
resolved by the recent far-infrared observations of nearby SN remnants.
