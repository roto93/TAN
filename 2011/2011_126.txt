In this issue (Aug 18 - 25, 2011)

1. IAU Individual Membership application (September 30, 2011)
2. ASIAA Colloquium (Aug 26): Shinji Koide (Kumamoto Univ)
3. Telescope and Instrument Conference (Nov 24-29)

==============================================================================

Dear Colleagues,

The XXVIII General Assembly of IAU will be held on August 20-31, 2012
in Beijing, China. As usual, it is time for professional astronomers
and astrophysicists, if you are not already an IAU Individual Member,
to file your IAU Individual Membership applications. An Individual
Member can be admitted to the IAU by the Executive Committee at the
General Assembly on the basis of a proposal for nomination from the
National Committee for Astronomy (NCA) in their home country or in their
long-term residence country. In Taiwan, the NCA is the Astronomical
Society of the Republic of China (ASROC).

Basically, the individual membership in the IAU is open to astronomers and
astrophysicists with a PhD or equivalent. Individuals applying for
nomination for IAU Individual Membership should contact ASROC before
September 30, 2011. An application for nomination of Individual Membership
should include the full name (in both Chinese and English if applicable),
date and place of birth, and nationality of the candidate; postal and email
addresses; the University, year, and subject of the M.Sc./Ph.D. or
equivalent degree; the current affiliation and occupation, the position
title, and the IAU Division(s) and/or IAU Commission(s) (please see
http://www.iau.org/science/scientific_bodies/ ) which the candidate wishes
to join. More details on the qualification for membership and application
procedure can be found at:
http://www.iau.org/administration/membership/individual/qualification/

If interested, please send your application to Ms. Emily Wei at
<emilywei@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw> and cc it to Ms. P-J Liu at
<peijuliu@ntnu.edu.tw> by September 30, 2011.


Regards,
Yi-Jehng Kuan
on behalf of the ASROC

Abstract: http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/activity/colloquium.php

*** Colloquium
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:	Prof. Shinji Koide (Kumamoto University)
Topic:		A basis of resistive GRMHD simulation
Time:		8/26 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:		 R1203
Abstract:
Ideal general relativistic MHD (GRMHD) simulations had revealed that
magnetic reconnection is caused around rapidly rotating black hole
spontaneously. To perform numerical simulations of such magnetic
reconnection self-consistently, we use resistive GRMHD equations
as the simplest approximation. I will talk about the basis for
the simulation and some examples.
