Speaker:	Prof. Aeree Chung (Yonsei University)
Topic:		Redshift Search Receiver and Extragalactic Molecular Gas Studies
Time:		7/15 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:		ASMAB R1203
Abstract:
Redshift Search Receiver (RSR) is a ultra-wideband spectrometer that covers the entire 3mm atmospheric window (75~111 GHz) simultaneously. It has been developed at the University of Massachusetts as the facility instrument for the Large Millimeter Telescope (LMT), a 50 meter radio telescope which has been being built in Mexico. While the LMT was under construction, the RSR had been commissioned on the Five College Radio Astronomy Observatory (FCRAO) 14 meter, carrying out several science programs. In this talk, I will present the highlights of the early extragalactic studies using the RSR, and give some updates on the current status of the instrument and the LMT.
