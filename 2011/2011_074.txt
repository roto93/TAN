Abstract:
The current accelerating expansion of the Universehas been connoted consistently by a wide scope of cosmological data. It has been known that the geometrical tests like standard candles (in the form of SNIa) and standard rulers (in CMB and BAO) consistent with the so called LambdaCDM(LCDM) model. Also the perturbational tests including the linear growth factor (so called EG test) and clusters (cluster numbers, WL, and SZe)  are claimed to be compatible with LCDM. We demonstrate the challenges and pitfalls in these statements. It is too early to make any conclusion for the origin of the present accelerating universe with the current observables.
