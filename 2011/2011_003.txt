Subject: [Nrao-announcements] ALMA Early Science Pre-Announcement 

Dear Colleagues, 

The National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO), in concert with our 
international partners at the European Southern Observatory (ESO), the 
National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ), and the Joint ALMA 
Observatory (JAO), is pleased to release the following pre-announcement regarding 
Early Science with ALMA. 

(1)  PLAN for ALMA EARLY SCIENCE CYCLE 0 

The Joint ALMA Observatory (JAO) expects to start Early Science 
observations (Cycle 0) on a best effort basis late in 2011 and a call for 
proposals will be issued at the end of the first quarter of 2011. The 
purpose of Early Science will be to deliver scientifically useful results 
to the astronomy community and to facilitate the ongoing characterization 
of ALMA systems and instrumentation as the capability of the array 
continues to grow. Early Science will not be allowed to delay unduly the 
construction of the full 66-antenna array, but nonetheless provides an 
important opportunity for first science from this cutting edge facility. 
Early Science will continue through Cycle 1 and until construction of the 
ALMA array is complete. 

The first release of ALMA test data to the astronomy community will be 
through the Science Verification program 
(http://science.nrao.edu/alma/SV.shtml). Science Verification will involve 
observations of objects designed to test ALMA systems and confirm their 
performance.  The first data from these tests will be available by the 
time of the ALMA Early Science Cycle 0 Call for Proposals. 

The complete ALMA Early Science Cycle 0 Pre-Announcement from the JAO is at http://science.nrao.edu/alma/preannounce-full.shtml 

(2) EARLY SCIENCE SUPPORT in NORTH AMERICA 

As the exciting opportunities for Early Science begin with ALMA in 2011, 
the NRAO North American ALMA Science Center (NAASC, see 
http://science.nrao.edu/alma/intro-naasc.shtml) will be the 
observer interface to ALMA for the US and Canadian user community. The 
primary goal of the NAASC is to maximize the community's understanding of 
and access to ALMA Early Science. To this end, the NAASC will support the 
community in the preparation of ALMA observing proposals, provide 
up-to-date information on ALMA observing modes and capabilities, and 
provide ready access to the tools required to conduct science with ALMA. 
As science observations are acquired, the NAASC will offer a wide range of 
post-observation and data processing support for observers. 

Key Early Science proposal preparation support includes: 

(a) Community Outreach and Training Events 
(http://science.nrao.edu/alma/community1.shtml), to be held each month 
leading up to the Cycle 0 proposal deadline; and 

(b) "Observing with ALMA: A Primer for Early Science" 
(http://almatelescope.ca/ALMA-ESPrimer.pdf), a recommended download for 
all prospective ALMA Early Science proposers. 

(3) ALMA SESSIONS at the AAS MEETING in SEATTLE 

If you are attending the AAS meeting in Seattle, please join us for the NRAO Town Hall on Tuesday, 11 January, from 6:30-8:30 pm PST in Ballroom 6E to hear the latest about ALMA Early 
Science and other NRAO science opportunities. 
See http://science.nrao.edu/events/aas217townhall.shtml 

Additional information about ALMA Early Science will be provided in a 
AAS Special Session titled "Observing with ALMA" on Wednesday, 12 January, 
2-3:30 pm PST in Ballroom 6A. See http://science.nrao.edu/events/aas217alma.shtml. 

An ALMA Early Science Proposal Preparation tutorial will be held on Wednesday, 12 January, 5:30 - 6:45 pm PST in Room 304. This session will include the latest information on ALMA Early Science 
observing modes and capabilities, and describe how to create and submit an observing 
proposal using the ALMA Observing Tool and Simulator. 

We also invite AAS attendees to visit the NRAO booth (near the Job Center) in 
the AAS Exhibit Hall.

Subject: Re: The Second APCosPA Winter School/workshop

Dear Colleagues:

    It might be a good reminder. Our Winter School will have more than 20 
foreign "students" (graduate students and young postdocs) from mainland 
China (9), S. Korea (9), Japan (2+), and Australia (2). This is on top of 
the "domestic" "students" - which was limited to about 30. Again, we will 
have the "competitions" - last year, no. 1 to a student from Japan, no. 2 
from Beida, and no. 3 from New Zealand. This competition substantially 
upgraded the level of the school; students made their choice of whether to 
join the competition. The finalists would be excellent candidates for 
future employments. Thus, I urge you to encourage the outstanding students 
to attend the School/Workshop and the competitions.

    The web side is www.cospa.ntu.tw/2011winterschool. The deadline will 
be slightly postponed to a few dates after this message.            
    Sincerely yours, W-Y. Pauchy Hwang

Dear Colleagues:

    I apologize that the pace for the organization of the 2nd APcosPA 
Winter School/Workshop is somewhat slow - but in a good progress. At this 
point, we again anticipate that there are about 10 "students" (senoir 
graduate students, young postdocs, etc.) from China (Beida, Jao-Tung, 
etc.), more than 6 from South Korea, a few from Japan, and so on. The 
domestic participation is limited to about 40. We would like to choose, at 
the end of the program, a few "students" for awards. This message is 
intended so that you would encourage your best "students" to participate 
this competition, with the deadline to register as 7 January 2011.

    Merry Christmas and Happy New Year !!     

    Best wishes, W-Y. Pauchy Hwang
                 President, APCosPA Org

Dear Colleagues:

      The pace of the advancement in the area of Cosmology and Particle 
 Astrophysics (CosPA) is amazedly fast since the new century. The 
 researchers in the Asia Pacific region, including Australia, China, 
 Japan, Korea, Taiwan, etc., have played their due roles in making the 
 progresses. To make our marks more noticeable, we are forming the Asia 
 Pacific Organization for Cosmology and Particle Astrophysics (APCosPA 
 Org), starting from nothing but hopefully growing eventually into 
 something fairly visible.

      One beginning is to hold the First APCosPA Winter School, 18-29 
 January 2010, at National Taiwan University, Taipei, and now the Second 
 APCosPA Winter School/Workshop, January 17-28, also at NTU, Taipei. We 
 will try to cover the various topics in Cosmology and Particle 
 Astrophysics but mainly toward the graduate students and young 
 researchers. The anticipated lecturers (except the workshop period) 
 include:

      Chia-Hung Vincent Chang (NTNU, Taiwan)
      Pisin Chen (NTU, Taiwan)
      Kiwoon Choi (KAIST, Korea)
      Bruce Dawson (Adelaide, Australia)
      Xiao-Gang He (NTU, Taiwan) 
      Stephen D.H. Hsu (Oregon, USA)
      Sang Pyo Kim (Kunsan, Korea)
      Hyun Kyu Lee (Hanyang Univ, Korea)
      Miao Li (ITP, Beijing)
      Bo-Qiang Ma (Beida, Beijing)
      Jen-Chieh Peng (UIUC, USA)
      Alexei Starobinsky (Laudau Inst, Russia)
      Bin Wang (SJTU, China)
      David Wiltshire (Canterbury Univ, NZ)
      Anthony Zee (UCSB, USA) 

 Each will give two or three lectures, with a couple of hard problems. 
 The registered students or young postdocs could enter the competitions 
 with the awards given to the first few "students". 

                                  Sincerely yours, W-Y. Pauchy Hwang
