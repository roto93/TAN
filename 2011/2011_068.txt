Dear Yi-Jehng,

    Could you please circulate the following annoucement? Thanks!
Best,
Chin-Fei

Dear All,

   This coming Friday afternoon, we will host an 1-hour event to promote our 
ALMA project (see the attached flyer). Recently, a Japanese rock band
named Acidman has released an album with a title of ALMA. Here is the link to 
that album,

This band is coming to Taipei this week and will visit us on this Friday, 
chatting with us about our ALMA science and their ALMA songs.

Venue: 1F Auditorium in the Astronomy-Mathematics Building, NTU
Time: April 22th, 1:00pm-2:00pm.

Please join and invite your colleagues and friends. Let's see what will come 
out when Science meets Music.

Dear Prospective Proposers,

Here are two reminders for you:

(1) A PI in Taiwan has access to ALMA through both East Asia (EA) and North
America (NA) regions. He/She can select which region the time should be
charged to. He/She can register with the ALMA Science Portal in both regions
using different User Names and E-mail addresses.

(2) Notice of Intent: To help ensure that the Cycle 0 review process is set
up in a way that allows proper handling of the set of proposals to be
assessed, and to assist the JAO to schedule the two configurations offered,
prospective Principle Investigators are strongly encouraged to submit a
notice of intent by April 29 using a simple web form on the science portal.

Thanks,
Chin-Fei
