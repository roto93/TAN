Speaker:	Prof. Shinji Koide (Kumamoto University)
Topic:		A basis of resistive GRMHD simulation
Time:		8/26 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:		 R1203
Abstract:
Ideal general relativistic MHD (GRMHD) simulations had revealed that
magnetic reconnection is caused around rapidly rotating black hole
spontaneously. To perform numerical simulations of such magnetic
reconnection self-consistently, we use resistive GRMHD equations
as the simplest approximation. I will talk about the basis for
the simulation and some examples.
