> Objective and Scope:
> The objective of the school/seminar is to promote education and  
> research
> in planetary sciences for highly motivated graduate students and young
> researchers by providing them with an opportunity to interact with  
> leading
> scientists in a specific field. Note that the term “Planetary  
> Sciences” is used
> in a broader sense to include astronomy, astrophysics, astrochemistry,
> astrobiology, astromineralogy, geosciences, space science, cosmology,
> and other related fields.
> The eighth school is jointly held with the Asian Academic Seminar  
> hosted
> by JSPS, Japan, and DST, India, for providing Asian young researchers
> with intensive training in areas of Astronomy and Space Science. The
> seminars comprise lectures by experts in the subject fields,  
> discussions,
> practical training, study visits and other components.
>
> Topic of the coming school:
> Challenges in Astronomy: Observational Advances
>
> The main part of the school will be a series of lectures on 'Recent  
> and
> Future Advances in Observational Astronomy.' The observational part of
> astronomy has revealed various, important phenomena in the Universe
> collaborating with theoretical works, and advancing fronts in
> well-established parts, e.g., optical-infrared, radio, high-energy  
> radiations.
> Furthermore, the gravitational wave is expected to be detected in near
> future, and the advancement of “virtual observatory”  
> would enable
> astronomers to conduct multi-wavelength data-incentive research, as  
> the
> 4th paradigm in astronomy. Young astronomers are expected to learn
> about world-wide trend for constructing a wider and concrete base of
> their own research.
>
> Lectures:
> Internationally well-established experts in various fields will  
> review recent
> progress in our understandings of those fields. The lecturers and  
> their
> topics (tentative) are listed below:
>
> 1. David Bennett (Univ. Notre Dame, France), Exoplanet Detection by
>   Gravitational Microlensing
