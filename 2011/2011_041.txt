Subject: Re: CFHT Call for Proposal (11B)

Dear those who may apply for CFHT time,

I found my mistake on the deadline described in our announcement.

> 23 March 2011 - 8:00 am Taiwan time 


The correct date and time are 25 March 2011 - 8:00 am Taiwan time.

best regards,

Hiro Takami, Chair of CFHT Taiwan TAC
