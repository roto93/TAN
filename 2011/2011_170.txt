Dear Yi-Jehng, please distribute the following message to TAN. Thanks a lot.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear all, our up-coming colloquiums include:

10/14 (Fri) 14:00 - 15:00
Speaker: Dr. Chiang-Mei Chen (NCU Physics)
Title: Two-fold description of back hole 
Abstract: 
In this talk, I will firstly introduce essential properties of black hole which inspire
a new conceptual idea: holographic principle. This idea gives a complete different
viewpoint of black hole leading a connection with field theory. I will briefly review
the recent progress in this subject. 

10/21 (Fri) 16:00 - 17:00
Speaker: Dr. Alian Omont (IAP)
Title: Strongly lensed high redshift galaxies identified in Herschel wide surveys.
Prospects for ALMA observations.
Abstract:
The very few early known, strongly lensed high-z sub-mm sources (FIRAS10214, Cloverleaf,
APM08279), played a very important role in the development of high-z submm/mm astronomy
through pioneer detections of 0.85-1.2mm continuum and CO lines, and various high
sensitivity studies allowed by their strong magnification. Herschel wide surveys, which
will hopefully observe ~1000 deg?, are discovering hundreds of similarly strongly lensed
submm galaxies (e.g. Negrello et al. 2010). I will first review the current state of
mm/submm follow-up of such Herschel lensed galaxies with IRAM and other facilities, for
CO redshift determination, mapping mm continuum and CO lines with interferometers,
measuring 1.2mm continuum flux density, etc. I will specially stress the case of the
recent detection of H2O at IRAM/PdBI in two such sources at z=2.3 and 3.3 (Omont et
al.2011). These examples give an idea of the numerous studies allowed by strong lensing
magnification and the enhanced capabilities of ALMA and IRAM/NOEMA, using this unique
sample of hundreds of Herschel high-z lensed galaxies.

All talks take place in Room 1013, Science Building 4, National Central University.

Dear Yi-Jehng, can you circulate the following IANCU Colloquium announcement? Thanks a lot.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear all, upcoming Colloquium at IANCU (S4-Room 1013) are:


Title: Strongly lensed high redshift galaxies identified in Herschel wide surveys.
Prospects for ALMA observations.
Speaker: Dr. Alian Omont (IAP)
Date: 2011-10-21
Time: 16:00-17:00
Abstract: The very few early known, strongly lensed high-z sub-mm sources (FIRAS10214,
Cloverleaf, APM08279), played a very important role in the development of high-z
submm/mm astronomy through pioneer detections of 0.85-1.2mm continuum and CO lines, and

Title: Nuclear Activity in Low Luminosity Spiral Galaxies
Speaker: Dr. Mousumi Das (Indian Institute of Astrophysics)
Date: 2011-11-01
Time: 14:00-15:00
Abstract: Low Luminosity spiral galaxies are generally dark matter dominated systems
that that have extended gas disks but show little star formation. They are thus poorly
evolved galaxies and do not show much nuclear activity. However, in our recent studies
of these galaxies we find that a significant fraction do have active galactic nuclei
(AGN) that are associated with low mass nuclear black holes. Most of these galaxies
either have large bulges or are in the process of forming a bulge. In some cases radio
lobes or jets are also seen with the AGN activity. This presentation will focus on
multi-frequency studies of this nuclear activity and its implications for studies of
galaxy evolution.

Title: The Mid-Infrared View of Galaxies: from Nearby Dwarfs to High-Redshift QSOs
Speaker: Dr. Chao-Wei Tsai (IPAC/Caltech)
Date: 2011-11-01
Time: 11:00-12:00
Abstract: The NASA Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) has mapped the entire sky
in 4 infrared bands centered at 3.4, 4.6, 12 and 22 microns, and has identified hundreds
of millions of IR sources. These bands are ideal for studying the extreme AGNs and
starburst galaxies. In the past one and half years, the WISE extragalactic science team
has discovered hyper luminous infrared galaxies (HyLIRGs), dust-obscured galaxies, red
AGNs, and very red blue compact dwarf galaxies (BCDs) with low metallicity. I will give
an overview of these results, and then focus on the projects of searching for HyLIRGs
and metal deficient BCDs, as well as on their multi-wavelength followup in details. At
the end, I will discuss the important impacts and applications of these discoveries to
our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution.

Title: PAndromeda - First Results from the High-cadence Monitoing of M31 with Pan-STARRS1
Speaker: Dr. Chien-Hsiu Lee (INACU)
Date: 2011-11-04
Time:14:00-15:00
Abstract: The Pan-STARRS 1 (PS1) survey of M31 (PAndromeda) is designed to identify
gravitational
microlensing events, caused by bulge and disk stars (self-lensing) and by compact matter
in the halos of M31 and the Milky Way (halo lensing, or lensing by MACHOs). With the 7
deg2 FOV of PS1, the entire disk of M31 can be imaged with one single pointing. Our aim
is to monitor M31 with this wide FOV with daily sampling (20 mins/day). In the 2010
season we acquired in total 91 nights towards M31, with 90 nights in the rP1 and 66
nights in the iP1. The total integration time in rP1 and iP1 are 70740s and 36180s,
respectively. As a preliminary analysis, we study a 40' X 40' sub-field in the central
region of M31, a 20' X 20' sub-field in the disk of M31 and a 20' X 20' sub-field for
the investigation of astrometric precision. We demonstrate that the PSF is good enough
to detect microlensing events. We present light curves for 6 candidate microlensing
events. This is a competitive rate compared to previous M31 microlensing surveys. We
finally also present one example light curve for Cepheids, novae and eclipsing binaries
in these sub-fields.

Dear Yi-Jehng, can you circulate the following IANCU Colloquium announcement? Thanks a lot.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear all, upcoming Colloquium at IANCU (S4-Room 1013) are:

Title: Waves and Their Instabilities in Astrophysical Disks
Speaker: Prof. Uri (Evgeny) Griv (Dept. of Physics, Ben-Gurion University)
Date: 2011-10-18
Time: 15:00-16:00
Abstract: The theory of disk spiral structure and thickening has a long history, but, as
we emphasize in this talk, is not yet complete. The classical criterion for a disk to be
unstable to substructure formation by self-gravitation is that the Toomre parameter, Q,
be less than unity. Combined with the Lin-Shu dispersion relation for self-gravitating
spiral waves in a disk, this is a venerable suggestion as to why disk galaxies,
protostellar and protoplanetary disks, and Saturn's rings always exhibit spiral
structure. In this talk, we consider the properties of both Lin-Shu-type compression
density waves and bending transverse-type waves. Such unstable waves can propagate in
astrophysical disks under consideration and lead to both spiral structures and disk
thickening. This could have consequences for all observations that pertain to the
present distribution of old collisionless components of the Galactic mass, the gas
component of protoplanetary disks, or the distribution of ice particles of Saturn's rings.

Speaker:	David Koo (UCO/LICK, UC Santa Cruz)
Topic:		DEEP, AEGIS, & CANDELS: New Panchromatic Vistas of Distant Galaxies and AGN's
Time:		10/21 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:		 R1203
Abstract:
I will give an overview of the Keck intermediate-redshift DEEP spectroscopic survey programs and the AEGIS multiwavelength surveys and reasons why they are particularly well suited for high-quality studies of distant galaxies and AGN's. After a brief summary of our major science findings, more details will be given 1) about a new measure of kinematics to track disk evolution, 2) about a rare class of very low metallicity, but very luminous, galaxies, and 3) about our discovery that galactic winds appear to be common at z ~1.4. I will close with an advertisement for a new 900+ orbit "public" imaging/grism survey  with HST (CANDELS) that is beginning to  open new doors for understanding very distant galaxies, AGN's, and supernovae.
