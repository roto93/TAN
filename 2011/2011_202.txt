*** Colloquium
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:	Dr. Takaya Nozawa (IPMU)
Topic:		Dust Production by Various Types of Supernovae
Time:		12/2 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:		 R1203
Abstract:
Supernovae (SNe) have been thought to be major sources of interstellar
dust. I will introduce a series of our works on dust formation in the ejecta
of SNe and dust destruction by the shocks penetrating into SN remnants.
I demonstrate how the mass of dust ejected from SNe to the interstellar
medium depend on the types of SNe, showing that envelope-stripped
SNe such as Type IIb/Ib/Ia are likely to be minor sources of dust.. I also
mention the difference in estimates of dust mass formed in SNe between
theory and observation, and describe that this difference is now getting
resolved by the recent far-infrared observations of nearby SN remnants.

Dear all, below is the information for upcoming colloquium at IANCU;

Title: Multiwavelength studies of clusters associated with H II regions
Speaker: Dr. Anil Pandey (ARIES, Manora Peak, Nainital, India)
Date: 2011-12-09
Time: 14:00-15:00
Location: NCU  S4-1013
Abstract:

Since last few years we are pursuing multiwavelength studies of star-forming regions to
understand the star formation scenario and the initial mass function (IMF) in these
regions. The pre-main-sequence objects associated with the regions are identified on the
basis of near/ mid infrared colour excess, H_alpha emission and X-ray emission. The ages
of the young stellar sources have been estimated using the optical colour-magnitude
diagram, which indicate a non-coeval star formation in the clusters. On the basis of
recent observations we have found evidence for triggered star formation at the periphery
of cluster regions.

Dear Colleagues,

The NTU Physics Department, Center for Condensed Matter Science, Institute
of Atomic and Molecular Sciences, and the Academia Sinica Institute of
Astronomy and Astrophysics invite everyone to our joint colloquium series.
The speakers are all famous international scholars and the colloquia are
aiming at a broad audience, including undergraduate students. Below is the
information of the talk on December 6(Tuesday). Please help to forward this
to the colleagues in your departments.

Best Regards,
Chih-Wei Chang (CCMS)
Jiunn-Wei Chen (NTU Physics)
Jer-Lai Kuo (IAMS)
Wei-Hao Wang (ASIAA)

Speaker: Che-Ting Chan
 Topic: Invisibility: fact or fiction?
Time: 12/06 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:10
Place: Room 104, CCM-New Physics Building

Abstract: Can we make objects invisible? Invisibility has obsessed
humankind for centuries and it is only very recently that researchers have
shown that cloaking is not just fiction: it can be realized in principle
through the development of new artificial materials called metamaterials
and a new mathematical method called transformation optics. In this talk, I
will review a few different strategies to realize invisibility and related
notions. I will show that invisibility can be realized by (i) a special
type of coating which can guide waves around an object, (ii) metamaterials
that can cancel the scattering of other objects, (iii) resonance effect
that can suppress optical excitation, (iv) a zero-refractive index medium
if special boundary conditions are satisfied, and (v) using active sources
to create a quiet zone. The limitations of these each of these approaches
will be discussed.

Brief Bio: C.T. Chan received his B. Sc. degree from the University of Hong
Kong in 1980 and his PhD degree from the University of California at
Berkeley in 1985.  He is currently a Chair Professor of Physics at HKUST,
and the director of William Mong Institute of Nano Science and Technology.
He has been elected a Fellow of the American Physical Society since 1996.
His primary research interest is the simulation and understanding of
material properties. He is now working on the theory a variety of advanced
materials, including photonic crystals, metamaterials and nano-materials.
He has over 200 publications and ~14,000 citations.
