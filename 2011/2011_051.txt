The sixth NAIC/NRAO school on single-dish radio astronomy will be held 10-16 July 2011 at the NRAO facilities in Green Bank, West Virginia. The objective of the school is to provide graduate students, post-docs, and experts in other fields of astronomy with knowledge and practical experience in the techniques and applications of single-dish radio astronomy. The school includes an intensive series of lectures and a hands-on radio astronomy project in which participants will acquire observations with the Arecibo 305-m telescope or the Green Bank 100-m (GBT) telescope, analyze the data, and interpret the results. The Single-Dish Radio Astronomy School is sponsored by the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO), the National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center (NAIC), and the National Science Foundation.
