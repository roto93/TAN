Dear colleagues,

A group of us here in Europe have been lucky enough to be given the
opportunity to host a one-day workshop in December on "Cosmology
Meets Machine Learning"  at the biggest computer science conference
there is: NIPS.  Several well-known cosmologists will summarise some
data science problems in cosmology, and we hope to attract quite a few
statisticians and data scientists to join the discussion.

This year the meeting is in Spain, in the mountains 1 hour drive from
Granada, and the 1 day cosmology workshop will likely be on Friday Dec
16th (although possibly it might instead be on Saturday Dec 17th,
tbc).

This workshop is a good opportunity to get new ideas on the day, and
start collaborations, with the best computer scientists from around
the world. From our experience at computer science meetings when
advertising GREAT08, there are a surprising number of cosmology
enthusiasts in their midst. They especially like self-contained
problems involving large amounts of data - especially real data.

If you are interested in submitting an abstract for a poster and
associated spotlight (short) talk, please see the call below. The
deadline is coming up fast... And of course, please do advertise this
opportunity further if you like!

All the best,

Phil Marshall
(on behalf of the Organising Committee)

About the Conference
--------------------

NIPS is one of the leading and most important international
conferences in the field of Machine Learning, Computational Statistics
and Artificial Intelligence and enjoys a long tradition and strong
reputation. For more information please visit the meeting webpage.


Description
-----------

Cosmology aims at the understanding of the universe and its evolution
through scientific observation and experiment and hence addresses one
of the most profound questions of human mankind. With the
establishment of robotic telescopes and wide sky surveys cosmology
already now faces the challenge of evaluating vast amount of data.

Multiple projects will image large fractions of the sky in the next
decade, for example the Dark Energy Survey will culminate in a
catalogue of 300 million objects extracted from peta-bytes of
observational data. The importance of automatic data evaluation and
analysis tools for the success of these surveys is undisputed.

Many problems in modern cosmological data analysis are tightly related
to fundamental problems in machine learning, such as classifying stars
and galaxies and cluster finding of dense galaxy populations.  Other
typical problems include data reduction, probability density
estimation, how to deal with missing data and how to combine data from
different surveys.

An increasing part of modern cosmology aims at the development of new
statistical data analysis tools and the study of their behaviour and
systematics often not aware of recent developments in machine learning
and computational statistics.

Therefore, the objectives of this workshop are two-fold:

(i) The workshop aims to bring together experts from the Machine
Learning and Computational Statistics community with experts in the
field of cosmology to promote, discuss and explore the use of machine
learning techniques in data analysis problems in cosmology and to
advance the state of the art.

(ii) By presenting current approaches, their possible limitations, and
open data analysis problems in cosmology, this workshop aims to
encourage scientific exchange and to foster collaborations among the
workshop participants.


Submission Instructions
-----------------------

We invite submission of abstracts on topics in the following areas:

* challenging problems in cosmology data analysis
* applications of machine learning methods in cosmological data
analysis problems

Submissions should not exceed 200 words and will be judged on
technical merit, the potential to generate discussion, and their
ability to foster collaboration within the workshop participants.
Accepted papers will be presented at the poster session with an
additional poster spotlight presentation. One author of every accepted
paper has to attend the workshop to present poster and spotlight talk.

Submissions should be sent to cmml.nips2011@gmail.com

Dear Colleagues,

The NTU Physics Department, Center for Condensed Matter Science, Institute
of Atomic and Molecular Sciences, and the Academia Sinica Institute of
Astronomy and Astrophysics invite everyone to our joint colloquium series.
The speakers are all famous international scholars and the colloquia are
aiming at a broad audience, including undergraduate students. Below is the
information of the talk on November 1(Tuesday). Please help to forward this
to the colleagues in your departments.

Best Regards,
Chih-Wei Chang (CCMS)
Jiunn-Wei Chen (NTU Physics)
Jer-Lai Kuo (IAMS)
Wei-Hao Wang (ASIAA)

Speaker: Pisin Chen, NTU
 Topic: Our Runaway Universe -- The discovery and implication of the 2011
Nobel Prize in Physics
Time: 11/1 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:10
Place: Room 104, CCM-New Physics Building

Abstract: This year=92s Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Saul Perlmutt=
er,
Brian Schmidt, and Adam Reiss for their 1998 discovery that the expansion o=
f
our universe is accelerating. This dramatic discovery was soon confirmed by
various independent observations. What causes such an accelerating
expansion? No one really knows. There have been numerous theoretical
proposals for the origin of this unexpected phenomenon, where the substance
responsible for it has been generally referred to as =91dark energy=92. Dar=
k
energy is a profound mystery as it touches upon many fundamental issues in
physics and astrophysics. In 2005, the Science Magazine surveyed more than =
a
thousand scientists from all disciplines to compile the top 150 science
questions for the 21st century, and =93the nature of dark energy=94 was vot=
ed as
the number one question among all sciences. In this colloquium we will
review the history of the 1998 discovery and the ensuing experiments that
have strengthened this finding. We will then review the different
theoretical proposals that attempt to explain this fact, with attention to =
a
few selected models. We will end the talk with a historical and
philosophical perspective: would this Nobel-winning discovery trigger the
final resolution to bridge the gulf between quantum mechanics and general
relativity?

Brief Bio: Prof. Pisin Chen obtained his PhD from UCLA in theoretical
particle physics under J.J. Sakurai. He was elected APS Fellow in 1994 for
his discoveries of the plasma wakefield acceleration mechanism, the beam
self-focusing effect in plasmas and the beamstrahlung coherent pair
production process in linear colliders. In 2001 he demonstrated the
existence of the black hole remnant at Planck mass and size, which solved
the longstanding end-life problem of Hawking evaporation. He is two-time
recipient of the Gravity Research Foundation Essay Competition Awards (1995=
,
2001). He has published numerous papers on the nature of dark energy and
dark matter. In 2000 he initiated the Chen Institute, later renamed Kavli
Institute, for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology at Stanford University.
He joined NTU in 2007 and has since been the CC Leung Chair Professor of
Cosmology and the director of the Leung Center for Cosmology and Particle
Astrophysics (LeCosPA). In addition to theoretical work, he is also active
in experimentation. He currently leads the Taiwan team in ANITA and ARA
projects that search for ultra-high energy cosmic neutrinos in Antarctica,
and the UFFO satellite telescope to detect GRB prompt signals. He is the
International Co-Spokesperson for the ARA Observatory at South Pole.
