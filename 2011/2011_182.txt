Colloquium at IANCU


Title: The gamma-ray binary that surprises both astronomers and the general public
Speaker: Dr. Thomas P.H. Tam (NTHU Astronomy)
Date: 2011-11-18
Time: 14:00-15:00
Location: NCU Science Building 4, Room 1013
Abstract:

Among various gamma-ray sources in the Milky Way, high-mass X-ray binaries have
increasingly become a significant class of objects that emit characteristic, variable
non-thermal emission from radio waves to gamma-rays. In one (and only one) case, the
boardband radiation is nearly certainly known to be the result of the interaction
between the pulsar wind and the stellar wind. The binary system PSR B1259-63/LS 2883
consists of a 47.8 ms radio pulsar that orbits the companion Be star with a period of
3.4 years in a highly eccentric orbit. The recent discovery of >100 MeV gamma-rays from
PSR B1259-63/LS 2883 through the 2010 periastron passage has surprised not only
astronomers but also the general public in Taiwan through the reports in main-stream
media in July 2011. I will highlight the most fascinating results including major flares
that occur after the periastron passage and the road to this discovery.
