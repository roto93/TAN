Lulin One-meter Telescope (LOT) =97 Call for Observing Proposals for 2011B

Proposal Deadline =97 23:59 June 30, Thursday, 2011

The Lulin One-meter Telescope (LOT) solicits observing proposals for the
semester of 2011B.  The new semester begins on August 1st, 2011 and ends
on January 31st ,2012.

Those interested in applying for observing time can download the
proposal LaTex package from the web page:

  http://www.astro.ncu.edu.tw/~wchen/lulinprop/lotprop.zip

The completed proposal should contain the filled, compiled version of the
LaTex file, plus up to two more pages of figures, tables, and references,
as a single PDF file, and be submitted to the following email address:

  tac_lulin@astro.ncu.edu.tw

with a copy to me to avoid occasional erroneous delivery:

  wchen@astro.ncu.edu.tw

In addition to research proposals, we will also consider educational
projects for
advanced astronomical observation courses.  Time allocation will be
announced by
mid-July, 2011.

There are two instruments available, the Lulin CCD Imager (LCI) and the
Lulin
Compact Spectrograph (LCS).   In 2011B an optical tri-color simultaneous
imaging polarimeter
may become online on a share-risk basis.  Those who would like to know more
about
the polarimeter should contact me.   You can follow this url to get
information regarding
the telescope and instruments,

  http://www.lulin.ncu.edu.tw/lot/

Feel free to direct inquiries about telescope/instrument/site to
Mr Hung-Chin Lin, Manager of the Lulin Observatory, or about time requests
to me (wchen@astro.ncu.edu.tw)

Regards,
Wen Ping Chen
on behalf of the LOT Time Allocation Committee

Dear Colleagues,

The Joint ALMA Observatory (JAO) has announced that the ALMA Science 
Archive is now open for the submission of Cycle 0 Early Science observing 
proposals until the submission deadline at 15h UT/11h EDT/08h PDT on 
Thursday, June 30, 2011.

Proposers are reminded that all proposals must be submitted to the Science 
Archive using the ALMA Observing Tool, and that all PIs and co-Is must be 
registered at the ALMA Science Portal.

Additional information regarding ALMA Early Science proposals, the 
Observing Tool, and the proposal submission process is available via the 
ALMA Science Portal at http://www.almascience.org

The JAO has also announced the availability of the first 2 ALMA Science 
Verification datasets:

(1) The protoplanetary disk source TW Hya at Band 7 (0.87 mm), with high 
spectral resolution; and

(2) The galaxy merger NGC 3256 at Band 3 (3 mm), with low spectral 
resolution.

These datasets demonstrate the very early capabilities of ALMA. They were 
observed before 10 ALMA antennas were available and while many of the 
subsystems were still being tested, so they should not be construed to 
represent the data quality for Early Science. These datasets are provided 
now to enable the user community to become acquainted with the ALMA data 
structure, observing strategies, and data reduction techniques.

Additional information regarding the Science Verification Data is 
available via the "ALMA Data" tab at the ALMA Science Portal.

> Subject: Taiwan Mock ALMA Proposal Review - Deadline: June 10th

Dear Colleagues,

With the ALMA proposal deadline on 06/30 fast approaching, prospective users
should get their proposals prepared now. As noted at the recent ALMA user
workshop on 05/21, the ARC Taiwan node will hold a mock ALMA proposal
review.

Recent SMA proposal statistics have shown alarming messages about the
quality of proposals from on-island investigators, and as noted in
the user workshop, the competition of ALMA early science cycle 0 will
be extremely high (with a oversubscription rate possibly exceeding
10!). Thus, only very well-prepared proposals will succeed.

Proposals fail sometimes due to 1) unclear science questions or goals and/or
poorly designed experimenting methods/approaches, but also often due to 2)
poor writing or last minute compilation. The purpose of this review is to
improve the quality of ALMA-T proposals for better success rate by enforcing
potential users to prepare the proposals early, thus, to at least eliminate
the last minute writing and to further sharpen the science ideas.

This mock review is open to all Taiwanese users including the ones outside
of ASIAA. The proposal submission deadline is 2011.06.10. Full proposal,
including scientific and technical justification, figures and tables, is
required to submit to arc@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw in pdf format. Technical
assessment will be carried out by the Taiwan ARC staff. Scientific review
will be conducted through paper by a review panel, including Naomi Hirano,
Shih-Ping Lai, Wei-Hao Wang, Kazushi Sakamoto, and Ciska Kemper.

Technical and scientific review comments will feedback to the PIs through
email a week afterwards on 2011.06.17. Face-to-face discussion with the ARC
staff or review panel members may be considered and arranged. PIs can
incorporate these comments into proposal revision before "true" submission.

Here is the link to the webpage of that annoucement:
http://alma.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/tw_mock.php

and any update will be posted there.

Best Regards,
Chin-Fei
On behalf of TW ARC Node.

Speaker:  Hitoshi Murayama, IPMU and UC Berkeley
Topic: Quantum Universe
Time: 6/7 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:10
Place: Room 104, CCM-New Physics Building

Abstract: What is the Universe made of? How did it come to be? Why do we
exist? This kind of fundamental questions about the Universe used to be jus=
t
philosophy, but are now coming into the realm of quantitative science. The
key is in quantum physics of elementary particles that determined the
evolution of the Universe when it was very young. I will discuss this
amazing connection between the large (the Universe) and the tiny (elementar=
y
particles), in the context of current and forthcoming experiments.

Abstract: http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/activity/colloquium.php

*** Colloquium
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:	Dr. Jack Sayers (Caltech)
Topic:		Extra-galactic science from the Caltech Submm Observatory: massive galaxy clusters and high-redshift galaxies
Time:		6/10 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:		ASMAB R1203
Abstract:
As the largest gravitationally bound objects in the universe, clusters are
ideally suited for astrophysical and cosmological studies. I will present
results from our ongoing program which has imaged the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich
(SZ) effect in ~40 massive galaxy clusters with Bolocam. The SZ effect is
sensitive to the integrated pressure in the intra-cluster medium (ICM),
which contains ~90% of the baryonic mass of the cluster. Our data are able
to constrain the morphology of the ICM, and to measure the pressure beyond
the cluster virial radius. These clusters all have deep ancillary data
(X-ray, lensing, etc.), and will allow us to probe for non-gravitational
physics and to calibrate mass-observable scaling relations for use in
cosmological studies. Bolocam's successor, MUSIC, will be deployed in late
2011 and will allow us to image clusters 10 times faster compared to
Bolocam. MUSIC will also survey 10s of square degrees for dusty
star-forming galaxies at high redshift, and will discover 100s of galaxies
at z>3.
