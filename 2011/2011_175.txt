Dear Colleagues,

The NTU Physics Department, Center for Condensed Matter Science, Institute
of Atomic and Molecular Sciences, and the Academia Sinica Institute of
Astronomy and Astrophysics invite everyone to our joint colloquium series.
The speakers are all famous international scholars and the colloquia are
aiming at a broad audience, including undergraduate students. Below is the
information of the talk on November 1(Tuesday). Please help to forward this
to the colleagues in your departments.

Best Regards,
Chih-Wei Chang (CCMS)
Jiunn-Wei Chen (NTU Physics)
Jer-Lai Kuo (IAMS)
Wei-Hao Wang (ASIAA)

 Topic: Our Runaway Universe -- The discovery and implication of the 2011
Nobel Prize in Physics
Time: 11/1 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:10
Place: Room 104, CCM-New Physics Building

Abstract: This year=92s Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Saul Perlmutt=
er,
Brian Schmidt, and Adam Reiss for their 1998 discovery that the expansion o=
f
our universe is accelerating. This dramatic discovery was soon confirmed by
various independent observations. What causes such an accelerating
expansion? No one really knows. There have been numerous theoretical
proposals for the origin of this unexpected phenomenon, where the substance
responsible for it has been generally referred to as =91dark energy=92. Dar=
k
energy is a profound mystery as it touches upon many fundamental issues in
physics and astrophysics. In 2005, the Science Magazine surveyed more than =
a
thousand scientists from all disciplines to compile the top 150 science
questions for the 21st century, and =93the nature of dark energy=94 was vot=
ed as
the number one question among all sciences. In this colloquium we will
review the history of the 1998 discovery and the ensuing experiments that
have strengthened this finding. We will then review the different
theoretical proposals that attempt to explain this fact, with attention to =
a
few selected models. We will end the talk with a historical and
philosophical perspective: would this Nobel-winning discovery trigger the
final resolution to bridge the gulf between quantum mechanics and general
relativity?

Brief Bio: Prof. Pisin Chen obtained his PhD from UCLA in theoretical
particle physics under J.J. Sakurai. He was elected APS Fellow in 1994 for
his discoveries of the plasma wakefield acceleration mechanism, the beam
self-focusing effect in plasmas and the beamstrahlung coherent pair
production process in linear colliders. In 2001 he demonstrated the
existence of the black hole remnant at Planck mass and size, which solved
the longstanding end-life problem of Hawking evaporation. He is two-time
recipient of the Gravity Research Foundation Essay Competition Awards (1995=
,
2001). He has published numerous papers on the nature of dark energy and
dark matter. In 2000 he initiated the Chen Institute, later renamed Kavli
Institute, for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology at Stanford University.
He joined NTU in 2007 and has since been the CC Leung Chair Professor of
Cosmology and the director of the Leung Center for Cosmology and Particle
Astrophysics (LeCosPA). In addition to theoretical work, he is also active
in experimentation. He currently leads the Taiwan team in ANITA and ARA
projects that search for ultra-high energy cosmic neutrinos in Antarctica,
and the UFFO satellite telescope to detect GRB prompt signals. He is the
International Co-Spokesperson for the ARA Observatory at South Pole.
