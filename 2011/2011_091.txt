Dear Colleagues,

The Joint ALMA Observatory (JAO) has announced that the ALMA Science 
Archive is now open for the submission of Cycle 0 Early Science observing 
proposals until the submission deadline at 15h UT/11h EDT/08h PDT on 
Thursday, June 30, 2011.

Proposers are reminded that all proposals must be submitted to the Science 
Archive using the ALMA Observing Tool, and that all PIs and co-Is must be 
registered at the ALMA Science Portal.

Additional information regarding ALMA Early Science proposals, the 
Observing Tool, and the proposal submission process is available via the 
ALMA Science Portal at http://www.almascience.org

The JAO has also announced the availability of the first 2 ALMA Science 
Verification datasets:

(1) The protoplanetary disk source TW Hya at Band 7 (0.87 mm), with high 
spectral resolution; and

(2) The galaxy merger NGC 3256 at Band 3 (3 mm), with low spectral 
resolution.

These datasets demonstrate the very early capabilities of ALMA. They were 
observed before 10 ALMA antennas were available and while many of the 
subsystems were still being tested, so they should not be construed to 
represent the data quality for Early Science. These datasets are provided 
now to enable the user community to become acquainted with the ALMA data 
structure, observing strategies, and data reduction techniques.

Additional information regarding the Science Verification Data is 
available via the "ALMA Data" tab at the ALMA Science Portal.
