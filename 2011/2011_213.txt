We, the local organizing committee of 9th International School, are
glad to announce that CPS 9th International School
of Planetary Sciences is schedule to be held from 24 June 2012.

Please find the details in the first circular attached.
We would very appreciate if you could forward this circular to those who
may have an interest in our school, and if possible, to the mailing lists

First Circular

       CPS 9th International School of Planetary Sciences

Date: 24-29 June 2012
Venue: Seapal Suma, a casual seaside resort located in the west part
of Kobe, Japan
Address: 1-1-1 Sumaura-dori, Suma, Kobe 654-0055 Japan
Phone: +81 78 731 6815 / Fax: +81 78 734 1896
Japanese site:

English site: http://web.travel.rakuten.co.jp/portal/my/info_page_e.Eng?f_no=13907&f_ptn1=&f_teikei=

Objective and Scope:
The objective of the school/seminar is to promote education and
research in planetary sciences for highly motivated
graduate students and young researchers by providing them with an
opportunity to interact with leading scientists in a
specific field. Note that the term “Planetary Sciences” is used in a
broader sense to include astronomy, astrophysics,
astrochemistry, astrobiology, astromineralogy, geosciences, space
science, cosmology, and other related fields.

Topic of the coming school:
Across the Earth into Exoplanets

Recent wonderful discovery of exoplanets requires us to rethink the
earth and generalize our understandings of the
planet. For the sake of doing so, we should first absorb up-to-date
knowledge about the structure of the earth from the
deep interior to the surface and dynamics producing various geological
and geophysical phenomena. We could then apply
the knowledge to various conditions of planets such as the early
earth, the other planets in the solar system, and
exoplanets. This application enables us to better understand the
coevolution of a solid planet’s interior and its
surface in terms of a search for a habitable exoplanet.

Lectures:
Internationally well-established experts in various fields will review
recent progress in our understandings of those
fields. The lecturers and their topics (tentative) are listed below:

* David J. Stevenson: Theoretical overview of structure and dynamics
of the Earth:
       its particularity and universality
* Shun-ichiro Karato: Earth mantle dynamics from planetary perspective
* Francis Nimmo: Evolution of rocky and icy planets in the solar system
* Philippe Lognonne: Planetary seismology and geophysics
* Taku Tsuchiya: High pressure physics of the Earth and beyond
* Diana Valencia: Earth-like exoplanets: predictions and observations
* TBD: Coupled evolution of the interior and surface environment of
the Earth and planets
* TBD: Earth and planetary magnetism

All the lectures are to be video-recorded and to be available to the
public through the CPS website. Lecture materials
are to be uploaded by each lecturer in PDF format to the CPS server by
30 June 2012 so that they could be viewed on the
same website.
