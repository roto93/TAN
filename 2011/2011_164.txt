Dear Yi-Jehng, please distribute the following message to TAN. Thanks a lot.

Dear all, our up-coming colloquiums include:

10/14 (Fri) 14:00 - 15:00
Speaker: Dr. Chiang-Mei Chen (NCU Physics)
Title: Two-fold description of back hole 
Abstract: 
In this talk, I will firstly introduce essential properties of black hole which inspire
a new conceptual idea: holographic principle. This idea gives a complete different
viewpoint of black hole leading a connection with field theory. I will briefly review
the recent progress in this subject. 

10/21 (Fri) 16:00 - 17:00
Speaker: Dr. Alian Omont (IAP)
Title: Strongly lensed high redshift galaxies identified in Herschel wide surveys.
Prospects for ALMA observations.
Abstract:
The very few early known, strongly lensed high-z sub-mm sources (FIRAS10214, Cloverleaf,
APM08279), played a very important role in the development of high-z submm/mm astronomy
through pioneer detections of 0.85-1.2mm continuum and CO lines, and various high
sensitivity studies allowed by their strong magnification. Herschel wide surveys, which
will hopefully observe ~1000 deg?, are discovering hundreds of similarly strongly lensed
submm galaxies (e.g. Negrello et al. 2010). I will first review the current state of
mm/submm follow-up of such Herschel lensed galaxies with IRAM and other facilities, for
CO redshift determination, mapping mm continuum and CO lines with interferometers,
measuring 1.2mm continuum flux density, etc. I will specially stress the case of the
recent detection of H2O at IRAM/PdBI in two such sources at z=2.3 and 3.3 (Omont et
al.2011). These examples give an idea of the numerous studies allowed by strong lensing
magnification and the enhanced capabilities of ALMA and IRAM/NOEMA, using this unique
sample of hundreds of Herschel high-z lensed galaxies.

All talks take place in Room 1013, Science Building 4, National Central University.
