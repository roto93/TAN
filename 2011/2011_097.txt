Dear Colleagues,

The NTU Physics Department, NTU Center for Condensed Matter Science, and the Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics invite everyone to our joint colloquium series. The speakers are all famous international scholars and the colloquia are aiming at a broad audience, including undergraduate students. Below is the information of the talk on June 14 (Tuesday). Please help to forward this to the colleagues in your departments.

Best Regards,
Jiunn-Wei Chen (NTU Physics)
Chih-Wei Chang (NTU CCMS)
Wei-Hao Wang (ASIAA)

Topic: Engineered Quantum Systems
Time: 6/14 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:10
Place: Room 104, CCM-New Physics Building


Abstract: Driven by advances in technology and experimental capability, it is now possible to engineer complex, multi-component systems that merge the once distinct fields of quantum optics and condensed matter physics. These systems find applications in quantum metrology, quantum information and provide a path to explore the shady world at the quantum-classical boundary. Two key experimental platforms for engineered quantum systems are superconducting quantum circuits and nanomechanical systems. I will review recent developments in each of these platforms and describe new schemes for quantum metrology, quantum sensing and quantum simulations.

Brief Bio: Gerard Milburn obtained a PhD in theoretical Physics from the University of Waikato in 1982. He is currently an Australian Research Council Federation Fellow at the University of Queensland and Director of the new Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence in Engineered Quantum Systems. Gerard Milburn is a Fellow of the Australian Academy of Science and The American Physical Society. He has worked in the fields of quantum optics, quantum chaos, mesoscopicelectronics, quantum information and quantum computation, and most recently in quantum nanomechanicsand superconducting circuit QED.
