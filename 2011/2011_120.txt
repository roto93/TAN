    Date: 2011 Sep 8 9:00-
    Location: Dai Seminar room in Subaru Building in NAOJ Mitaka Campus

    * Purpose
    The first call for proposal was successfully completed in gathering many
    proposals from all over the world. We thank all the users and make up
    our mind again in keeping up good work on science operation.

    ALMA is a growing instrument in the sense that ALMA capability keeps on
    being upgraded in the future with technological innovation and progress.
    We explain the development policy how ALMA will proceed with future
    development and upgrades in the operation phase in order to continue
    cutting edge science with ALMA.

    The aim of the meeting is to discuss what new capability and what
    upgrades maximizes ALMA science and is to hear from engineers what will
    be within reach to upgrade important items in development. The goal of
    the meeting is to share scientific demand and important items in the
    future ALMA development plan.

    * Application Deadline
    - General  2011 Sep. 5th (Wed) 17:00

    * Presentation
    Fill the form below and prepare presentation taking the following items
    into account.
    - Better angular resolution
    - Sensitivity in continuum and line
    - Sideband separation or DSB to SSB (single side band) at band 9 and 10
    - Simultaneous observations at more than one band
    - New frequency window
