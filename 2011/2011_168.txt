Topic:		DEEP, AEGIS, & CANDELS: New Panchromatic Vistas of Distant Galaxies and AGN's
Time:		10/21 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:		 R1203
Abstract:
I will give an overview of the Keck intermediate-redshift DEEP spectroscopic survey programs and the AEGIS multiwavelength surveys and reasons why they are particularly well suited for high-quality studies of distant galaxies and AGN's. After a brief summary of our major science findings, more details will be given 1) about a new measure of kinematics to track disk evolution, 2) about a rare class of very low metallicity, but very luminous, galaxies, and 3) about our discovery that galactic winds appear to be common at z ~1.4. I will close with an advertisement for a new 900+ orbit "public" imaging/grism survey  with HST (CANDELS) that is beginning to  open new doors for understanding very distant galaxies, AGN's, and supernovae.
