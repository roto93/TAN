Announcement:

The Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics at Academia Sinica (ASIAA)
announces its third workshop for Taiwanese ALMA users. The workshop is
oriented for all astronomers, regardless of specialty.

The first call for proposals has been issued on March 30, 2011 for the ALMA
Early Science (ES). This ALMA workshop is designed to provide information on
the ES capabilities, ARC user support, Proposal Review Process, and to help
users in preparing and submitting their proposals with the ALMA tools. There
will be an open Q&A session for users to consult our ARC members with their
questions. Also, there will be a proposal assessment session, in which users
will present their proposals with scientific and technical justifications,
each for about 20-30 mins, for the assessment. Users are encouraged to sign
up for this session for sharpening their proposals! Additional workshops
will be organized later to help users to prepare their observing programs
(i.e., scheduling blocks) and to reduce their data.


The organizing committee encourages all the Taiwanese astronomers and
scholars interested in observing with ALMA to take part in this workshop.
Students coming from outside Taipei City/County can apply for travel support
from ASIAA for the transportation and accommodation, and this support is
sponsored by tuCASA. Due to limited space and the hands-on nature of this
workshop, participation will be limited to 50 people.

Action items before coming to the workshop:

    1. browse through all the presentation files in our 2nd ALMA user workshop
    2. read through the ALMA ES Primer and the Science Web pages
    3. work through a OT example and a SIMDATA example
    4. register in the ALMA Science Portal and browse the helpdesk
    5. have their own favorite proposals ready for assessment

Sixth NAIC/NRAO School on Single-Dish Radio Astronomy 
10 ?V 16 July 2011 
Green Bank, West Virginia 

The sixth NAIC/NRAO school on single-dish radio astronomy will be held 10-16 July 2011 at the NRAO facilities in Green Bank, West Virginia. The objective of the school is to provide graduate students, post-docs, and experts in other fields of astronomy with knowledge and practical experience in the techniques and applications of single-dish radio astronomy. The school includes an intensive series of lectures and a hands-on radio astronomy project in which participants will acquire observations with the Arecibo 305-m telescope or the Green Bank 100-m (GBT) telescope, analyze the data, and interpret the results. The Single-Dish Radio Astronomy School is sponsored by the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO), the National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center (NAIC), and the National Science Foundation.
