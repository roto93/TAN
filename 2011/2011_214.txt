Dear Colleagues,

    We will have the 3rd APCosPA Winter School / Workshop on Cosmology and
Particle
Astrophysics at Department of Physics, National Taiwan University during
13-20 January 2012.
    The pace of the advancement in the area of Cosmology and Particle
Astrophysics (CosPA)
is amazedly fast since the new century. The researchers in the Asia Pacific
region, including
Australia, China, Hawaii, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, and Taiwan, have
played their due roles
in making the progresses. To make our marks more noticeable, we are forming
the Asia Pacific
Organization for Cosmology and Particle Astrophysics (APCosPA
Organization), starting from
nothing but hopefully growing eventually into something fairly visible.
    One beginning is to hold the First APCosPA Winter School, 18-29 January
2010, at National
Taiwan University, Taipei. We intend to cover the various topics in
Cosmology and Particle
Astrophysics but mainly toward the graduate students and young researchers.
    Each lecturer would give three or four lectures, with a couple of hard
problems. And the registered
students or young postdocs could enter the competitions with the awards
given to the first few "students ".

     W-Y. Pauchy Hwang

President, APCosPA Org.
