ASIAA Call for SMA proposals for 2011A

Dear Colleagues,

The ASIAA SMA Time Allocation Committee solicits 
proposals for
the ASIAA time of the Submillimeter Array (SMA) for the 
period
from 2011 May 16th to 2011 November 15 (2011A 
semester).
The ASIAA SMA time is open to those who are affiliated 
to
a Taiwanese university or a Taiwanese research 
institute.

The deadline for proposal submission for the ASIAA SMA 
time
for the 2011A semester is 2011 March 18 (Friday), 4AM 
in the
morning (Taiwan time).  [The deadline corresponds to 
March 17
(Thursday) 10AM in Hawaii, USA, and 4PM EST in 
Cambridge, USA.]

All Taiwanese SMA proposals must be submitted through 
the SMA
submission facility 
(http://sma1.sma.hawaii.edu/proposing.html).
New proposers in particular need to get registered 
(through
the submission web site) before submitting a proposal.
Taiwanese proposers should select "ASIAA" as their 
destination
TAC in the submission web page.  Please direct your 
inquiries
(in particular PI eligibility) to TATSUHIKO HASEGAWA
(hasegawa AT asiaa.sinica.edu.tw).

For technical information on the SMA, please visit
       http://sma1.sma.hawaii.edu/proposing.html   .
The SAO SMA information page will be updated for 2011A.
For Taiwan and ASIAA specific aspects (including the PI
eligibility, the ASIAA proposal selection process, and 
the
amount of available observing time), please visit
        http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/~SMART/  .

A few cautions about proposal format and writing merit 
reiterating.
- In addition to the page limit, there are limits to 
the font size
       (11 point or larger) and layout (two pages for
       text only and two
       pages for figures, tables, and references).
- A request for a good weather without a compelling 
reason tends to
       get a lower rating from reviewers.

Additional messages from the ASIAA SMA TAC :

A PI (Principal Investigator) should lead the proposed 
project, and
is expected to be the first author of the resulting 
papers.  If a PI
will not be able to do these, the PI should provide the 
reason in the
proposal.  For example, in a multi-wavelength, 
international campaign,
the PI for an SMA proposal may not be leading the 
entire project or
going to be the first author.  In such a case, the PI 
should provide
the background or circumstance in the proposal.

Should a PI become unable to do the work, Co-Is 
(Co-Investigators)
are expected to follow up the analysis and publication 
of already
executed or allocated projects under the PI. 
Co-investigators should
be aware of their responsibilities or obligations.  PIs 
should make
best efforts to obtain a consent before putting 
someone's name on a
proposal as a Co-I.

The PI of a successful proposal will be encouraged to 
provide an
observer at the summit of Mauna Kea.  For more details, 
please
consult the ASIAA web page listed above.

In order to encourage PhD students to use the SMA, the 
ASIAA SMA TAC
will make some considerations to proposals for PhD 
thesis projects.
Please visit the ASIAA web site for details.

The SMA is a complex instrument.  Consultation or 
collaboration
with those who are familiar with the SMA is 
recommended.  Contact
points for consultation are also found in the ASIAA web 
page
listed above.

Sincerely,

Tatsuhiko Hasegawa
on behalf of ASIAA SMA TAC
