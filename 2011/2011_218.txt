------ 2nd Announcement ------

Second Announcement of the 1st LeCosPA Symposium (December 20, 2011)

    As the time for the 1st LeCosPA Symposium is gradually approaching, 
we are pleased to update with you its development. So far most of the 
invited Plenary Speaker have made their commitments to attend this 
meeting. In addition we are very pleased to have rapidly filled up the 
slots for invited and contributed speakers in the Parallel Sessions. As 
for the social events, everything has been organized swiftly. We expect 
this meeting to be very exciting indeed.

    In order to further the bases of the participation, we have decided 
to extend the deadline of registration until December 31, 2011. There 
are still rooms for contributed talks in the Parallel Sessions and we 
strongly encourage you to volunteer yourself to share with us your 
latest findings in cosmology and particle astrophysics. In addition, we 
have decided to create a Poster Session to encourage presentations from 
post-docs and students. We have set aside a limited amount of our 
resource to provide financial support for students. Please send us 
message to inquire.

    Please do feel free to ask for our assistance with regard to your 
booking for the hotel accommodation and other logistic issues.

    Sincerely,

LeCosPA2012 Organizing Committee and Staff

Dear Colleagues,

The NTU Physics Department, Center for Condensed Matter Science, Institute
of Atomic and Molecular Sciences, and the Academia Sinica Institute of
Astronomy and Astrophysics invite everyone to our joint colloquium series.
The speakers are all famous international scholars and the colloquia are
aiming at a broad audience, including undergraduate students. Below is the
information of the talk on December 27(Tuesday). Please help to forward
this to the colleagues in your departments.

Best Regards,
Chih-Wei Chang (CCMS)
Jiunn-Wei Chen (NTU Physics)
Jer-Lai Kuo (IAMS)
Wei-Hao Wang (ASIAA)

Speaker: Naoki Kawashima, University of Tokyo
 Topic: Quantum Monte Carlo and Non-Ginzburg-Landau Type Phase Transition
Time: 12/27 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:10
Place: Room 104, CCM-New Physics Building

Abstract: Quantum Monte Carlo is one of powerful tools for clarifying
quantum state of matter. Its applications ranges from quantum magnets to
optical lattices. Here I summarize recent developments in the method and
how it can be implemented in the world fastest computer. I then focus on
how a class of peculiar quantum phase transitions have been discovered by
this method. The transition is realized in the familiar antiferromagnetic
Heisenberg model extended to the SU(N) symmetry.

Brief Bio: Prof. Dr. Kawashima is a professor at Institute for Solid State
Physics, University of Tokyo. He obtained his PhD in physics at Tokyo
University in 1992. After working as a postdoc at Los Alamos National
Laboratory, USA, for 1993-1995, he moved to Toho University (1995-1998) and
Tokyo Metropolitan University (1998-2004). Then he came back to Tokyo
University and has been working there since 2004. He received Ryogo Kubo
Medal in 2002 for his work in quantum Monte Carlo method.
