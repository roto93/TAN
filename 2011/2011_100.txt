Subject: ALMA Tutorial Talk on Splatalogue (Jun 22, 12:30pm)


Dear ALMA Potential Proposers,

   We will have a tutorial talk on Splatalogue, which is the ALMA Spectral
Line Catalogue, given on this Wednesday noon by Anthony Remijan from NRAO.
See below for the details. Please join!

   Thank you very much!

Title: Splatalogue as a tool for diagnosing the physical and chemical
       environments

Speaker: Anthony Remijan, North American ALMA Science Center (NAASC)/NRAO

Date: Wednesday (6/22)
Time: 12:30pm to 1:15pm
Place: ASIAA Room 1203

The next generation of powerful radio and millimeter/submillimeter
observatories (e.g. EVLA, GBT, ALMA, SOFIA, Herschel, etc...) require
extensive resources to help identify spectral line transitions. We
describe
the compilation of the most complete spectral line database currently
assembled for this purpose. The Splatalogue is an attempt to collate,
rationalize and extend existing spectroscopic resources for use by the
astronomical community. Splatalogue is a transition-resolved compilation
of
the publically available spectral line catalogs as well as individual
contributions from spectroscopists worldwide. To these databases we have
run
diagnostics for overlaps on transitions, frequencies, formulae and
chemical
names and have come up with a common way to display and designate each
individual species. Splatalogue also contains atomic and recombination
lines, template spectra, and is completely VO-compliant, queryable under
the
IVOA SLAP standard. It also recommends one frequency for use by the
astronomical community for each observed transition of known astronomical
molecules. The question that remains is how this database, or any other
spectral line catalog, can be utilized to determine the fundamental
questions still unanswered in star formation and galaxy evolution? In
addition to describing the details of the database and how users can get
access to the database, this presentation will also highlight some recent
observations that may violate the standards of identifying molecular
species
in astronomical environments and what lies ahead for determining the
overall
molecular complexity of the universe.
