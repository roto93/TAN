*** Colloquium
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:	Prof. Feng Yuan (SHAO)
Topic:		AGNs feedback at pc scale
Time:		7/29 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:		ASMAB R1203
Abstract:
In a hot accretion flow, the radiation from the innermost region of
the flow propagates outward and heats the electrons at large radii
via Compton scattering. It has been shown in previous works that if
the radiation is strong enough, $Lga 2%L_{rm Edd}$, the electrons
at the Bondi radius ($r_Bsim 10^5 r_s$) will be heated to be above
the virial temperature thus the accretion will be stopped. The
accretion will recover after the gas cools down. This results in the
oscillation of the black hole activity. In this paper we show that
this mechanism is the origin of the intermittent activity of some
compact young radio sources. Such intermittency is required to
explain the population of these sources. We calculate the timescales
of the black hole oscillation and find that the durations of active
and inactive phases are $3times 10^4 (0.1/alpha)(M/10^8msun)
(L/2%L_{rm Edd})^{-1/2}~{rm yr}$ and
$10^5(alpha/0.1)(M/10^8msun)~{rm yr}$, respectively, consistent
with those required to explain observations. Such kind of feedback
occurring at parsec scale should be common in low-luminosity AGNs
and should be considered when we consider their matter and energy
output.

First Announcement for Symposium on Cosmology and Particle Astrophysics 2011 (CosPA2011)

There have been many achievements in the area of Cosmology and Particle Astrophysics (CosPA) in the past few years. For researchers dedicated to Cosmology and Particle Astrophysics from the Asia-Pacific region, the Symposium on Cosmology and Particle Astrophysics (CosPA Symposium) provides a platform and opportunity to discuss new issues, exchange new ideas and learn about new techniques from both theoretical and experimental aspects. Starting from 2002, CosPA Symposiums have been successfully held in Taiwan, Korea, Australia, and Japan for seven times, during which improvements of communication and collaboration among researchers are achieved. Right now, CosPA Symposium has grown into a meeting with wide international influence.

CosPA2011 will be held in the campus of Peking University, Beijing, Mainland China, during October 28-31, 2011. The symposium will cover issues in many frontiers of Cosmology and Particle Astrophysics. CosPA2011 is now open to registration for participants.
