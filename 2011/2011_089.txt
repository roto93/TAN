Dear APCosPA colleagues:

     As I announced before, we are planning to organize a summer school
on dark energy in Kyushu island.  I would like to record it as one of the
activities of APCosPA Organization.  Please forward the school website
http://www.resceu.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/workshops/resceu11s/index_e.php
to your students or postdocs who may be interested in it.
     We have some fund to support local expenses.  Registration will be 
closed as soon as the number of participants has reached the capacity of 
the venue. So please tell possible participants from your group to contact 
me as soon as possible.

     Best wishes,

     Jun'ichi Yokoyama
