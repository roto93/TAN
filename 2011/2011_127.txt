*** Colloquium
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:	Prof. Richard de Grijs (KIAA, Peking University)
Topic:		Achievements and challenges in star formation
Time:		9/2 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:		 R1203
Abstract:
What has been the most profound discovery, progress or idea that has
emerged in astronomy over the last decade? And what will be the most
important challenge in astronomical research in the next decade? These
questions are at the heart of our discipline, but we rarely venture
outside of our own niche areas. I will attempt to focus on the broad
picture underlying the field of star formation and discuss the
requisite conditions for sustained progress in this field, aided by
recent achievements in the context of my group's star cluster
research.
