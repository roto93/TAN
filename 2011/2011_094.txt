Speaker:	Dr. Jack Sayers (Caltech)
Topic:		Extra-galactic science from the Caltech Submm Observatory: massive galaxy clusters and high-redshift galaxies
Time:		6/10 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:		ASMAB R1203
Abstract:
As the largest gravitationally bound objects in the universe, clusters are
ideally suited for astrophysical and cosmological studies. I will present
results from our ongoing program which has imaged the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich
(SZ) effect in ~40 massive galaxy clusters with Bolocam. The SZ effect is
sensitive to the integrated pressure in the intra-cluster medium (ICM),
which contains ~90% of the baryonic mass of the cluster. Our data are able
to constrain the morphology of the ICM, and to measure the pressure beyond
the cluster virial radius. These clusters all have deep ancillary data
(X-ray, lensing, etc.), and will allow us to probe for non-gravitational
physics and to calibrate mass-observable scaling relations for use in
cosmological studies. Bolocam's successor, MUSIC, will be deployed in late
2011 and will allow us to image clusters 10 times faster compared to
Bolocam. MUSIC will also survey 10s of square degrees for dusty
star-forming galaxies at high redshift, and will discover 100s of galaxies
at z>3.
