Dear Potential ALMA Proposers,

   Science Portal (SP) site has been updated last Tuesday. Here is a summary
of major updates in SP forwarded by Okumura-san of EA-ARC:

- Capabilities: We have added a link to the antenna configuration files,
   text regarding this. In addition, we have added text regarding the
   preliminary antenna reconfiguration time schedule. The Proposers
   Guide (both html text and pdf doc) has been updated accordingly.
   (see http://almascience.nao.ac.jp/call-for-proposals/capabilities)

  - ALMA Technical Hand book has newly been released. OT Ref Manual
   and ALMA Sensitivity Calculator Guide have been updated. EA Users
   Guide has also been updated.
   (see http://almascience.nao.ac.jp/document-and-tools)

  - A countdown clock has been added to the SP
    (see the right side of http://almascience.nao.ac.jp/)

  - A weather page with statistics and an atmosphere model tool has been
    added to 'About ALMA'
    (http://almascience.nao.ac.jp/about-alma/weather/overview)

  - The statistics on "Notice of Intent" has been added. (see
    http://almascience.nao.ac.jp/call-for-proposals/notice-of-intent)

  - Science Verification page.
    (http://almascience.nao.ac.jp/alma-data/science-verification)
    User can propose to observe the source that is already or will be used
    for the Science Verification.

Best Regards,

Dear Colleagues,

The NTU Physics Department, NTU Center for Condensed Matter Science, and th=
e
Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics invite everyone to
our joint colloquium series. The speakers are all famous international
scholars and the colloquia are aiming at a broad audience, including
undergraduate students. Below is the information of the talk on May 31
(Tuesday). Please help to forward this to the colleagues in your
departments.

Best Regards,
Jiunn-Wei Chen (NTU Physics)

Speaker:  Frank Hsu (=AE}=B9I=A5=CD), Academia Sinica
Topic: Nuclear Energy after Fukushima
Time: 5/31 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:10
Place: Room 104, CCM-New Physics Building

Abstract: After the tragic events in Japan, nuclear power is much in the
news, and re-evaluations are occurring on both sides of the nuclear debate.
Pragmatic scientists and engineers who have studied the problem agree that
of the available energy technologies, only nuclear power has the potential
to alleviate our current overwhelming dependence on fossil fuels. In Taiwan=
,
the choice is even clearer. As a commentator on National Public Radio in th=
e
United States has put it: if you are anti-CO2 and anti-nuclear, then you ar=
e
pro-blackouts. Phrased in terms of either energy self-sufficiency or an
antidote to climate change, the challenge before us must be how to make
nuclear power safer, cheaper, and more proliferation resistant, with a
tenable method for disposing the radioactive waste. A solution may exist in
molten salt reactors that operate on the thorium cycle, but mobilizing
public support for such an approach must increase the perceived benefits of
nuclear power while reducing its risks.
