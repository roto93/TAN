IANCU Colloquium

Title: EPOXI mission and ground-based observations of comet 103P/Hartley 2
Speaker: Dr. Lin Zhong-Yi (INACU)
Date: 2011-11-11
Time: 14:00-15:00
Location: NCU S4-1013

Abstract:

Ground-based observations provide synergistic information for space mission encounters
by providing data over longer timescales, at different wavelengths and using techniques
that are impossible with an in situ flyby. Here, we will summarize the results of EPOXI
mission and report our observations in support of the EPOXI spacecraft flyby of comet
103P/Hartley 2.

Dear Colleagues,

The NTU Physics Department, Center for Condensed Matter Science, Institute
of Atomic and Molecular Sciences, and the Academia Sinica Institute of
Astronomy and Astrophysics invite everyone to our joint colloquium series.
The speakers are all famous international scholars and the colloquia are
aiming at a broad audience, including undergraduate students. Below is the
information of the talk on November 8(Tuesday). Please help to forward this
to the colleagues in your departments.

Best Regards,
Chih-Wei Chang (CCMS)

Speaker: Thomas Henning, Max Planck Institute for Astronomy
 Topic: Physics of Star Formation
Time: 11/8 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place: Room 104, CCM-New Physics Building

Abstract: Star formation is a fundamental process in the universe, shaping
the structure of our and other galaxies. The talk will summarize the
general principles of the star formation process. It will discuss global
properties such as the star formation efficiency and the initial mass
function. In addition, it will also demonstrate the power of adaptive
optics in revealing the structure of star-forming regions.

Speaker: Leszek Roszkowski, University of Sheffield
 Topic: Dark Matter
Time: 11/8 (Tuesday) 15:20 - 16:20
Place: Room 104, CCM-New Physics Building

Abstract: After reviewing evidence for the existence of the dark matter
problem in the Universe, I will list and discuss some most promising
particle physics candidates for its explanation. I will provide an update
on prospects for the detection of dark matter and discuss the role that the
Large Hadron Collider may play in elucidating its particle physics nature.

Brief Bio: Prof. Roszkowski received his Master=A1=A6s degree from Warsaw
University, Poland in 1981, and his PhD degree from the University of
California at Davis in 1987. After postdoctoral positions at Texas A&M,
CERN, Michigan and Minnesota, in 1996 he joined Lancaster University as a
faculty member. In 2003 he was appointed a Full Professor and the leader of
the Astroparticle Physics and Cosmology Group at the University of
Sheffield. Since 2009 he has also been employed at the National Centre for
Nuclear Research in Warsaw, where he is currently setting up a new particle
theory group. Prof. Roszkowski has worked in the areas of particle aspects
of collider physics, astrophysics and early Universe cosmology. His main
areas of expertise are search for signatures of physics beyond the Standard
Model, especially supersymmetry and dark matter in the Universe.

Colloquium at IANCU


Title: The gamma-ray binary that surprises both astronomers and the general public
Speaker: Dr. Thomas P.H. Tam (NTHU Astronomy)
Date: 2011-11-18
Time: 14:00-15:00
Location: NCU Science Building 4, Room 1013
Abstract:

Among various gamma-ray sources in the Milky Way, high-mass X-ray binaries have
increasingly become a significant class of objects that emit characteristic, variable
non-thermal emission from radio waves to gamma-rays. In one (and only one) case, the
boardband radiation is nearly certainly known to be the result of the interaction
between the pulsar wind and the stellar wind. The binary system PSR B1259-63/LS 2883
consists of a 47.8 ms radio pulsar that orbits the companion Be star with a period of
3.4 years in a highly eccentric orbit. The recent discovery of >100 MeV gamma-rays from
PSR B1259-63/LS 2883 through the 2010 periastron passage has surprised not only
astronomers but also the general public in Taiwan through the reports in main-stream
media in July 2011. I will highlight the most fascinating results including major flares
that occur after the periastron passage and the road to this discovery.
