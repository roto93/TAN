Subject: Challenges in Astronomy: Observational Advances / CPS 8th planetary school

Dear Prof. Kuan,

Would you please announce the info of the CPS school via TAN?
I was a postdoc at ASIAA before and this is the second circular of
CPS 8th planetary school.  The first circular was forwarded by Naomi.

Thank you in advance,

Takayuki Tanigawa

Second Circular - REGISTRATION IS NOW OPEN-

---A Message from the Seminar/School Chair, Prof. Hiroshi Shibai---
The disaster caused by the huge earthquake and tsunami of 11 March is now
being overcome with extraordinary efforts by Japanese people as well as
through international cooperation initiated by many countries. The problem of
the six nuclear reactors is being addressed, though not quickly but through a
step-by-step approach. The reactors are cooled with plenty of water in order
to restrain nuclear reactions. The emanation of radioactive materials is still a
severe problem. The Japanese government and the owner of the crippled
nuclear power plants, the Tokyo Electric Power Company, are devoting their
efforts to stop these leaks.

Fortunately, our Seminar/School has not been affected at all by these
problems. The conference place in Awaji Island and KAMIOKANDE as well as
Osaka University and CPS are located in the western part of Japan, while the
nuclear reactors hit by the earthquake and tsunami are located in the
north-eastern part. The distance between the conference location and the
nuclear reactors is approximately 800 km, which is too great to be affected by
radioactive material. The electric power of our area has remained stable, since
we have a different electrical system in the western part of Japan. Therefore,
we have had neither damage nor other adverse effects due to this disaster.

Given these circumstances, we hope that many foreign and Japanese
participants will come to join this seminar/school with no apprehension. If we
do have any changes in the environment that may affect the program, then we
will inform all of you immediately.

English site: http://www-sk.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp/index-e.html

OBJECTIVE AND SCOPE:
The objective of the school/seminar is to promote education and research in
planetary sciences for highly motivated graduate students and young
researchers by providing them with an opportunity to interact with leading
scientists in a specific field. Note that the term “Planetary
Sciences” is used in
a broader sense to include astronomy, astrophysics, astrochemistry,
astrobiology, astromineralogy, geosciences, space science, cosmology, and
other related fields.
The eighth school is jointly held with the Asian Academic Seminar hosted by
JSPS, Japan, and DST, India, for providing Asian young researchers with
intensive training in areas of Astronomy and Space Science. The seminars
comprise lectures by experts in the subject fields, discussions,
practical training,
study visits and other components.

Topic of the coming school:
Challenges in Astronomy: Observational Advances

The main part of the school will be a series of lectures on 'Recent and Future
Advances in Observational Astronomy.' The observational part of astronomy
has revealed various, important phenomena in the Universe collaborating with
theoretical works, and advancing fronts in well-established parts, e.g.,
optical-infrared, radio, high-energy radiations. Furthermore, the gravitational
wave is expected to be detected in near future, and the advancement of “virtual
observatory” would enable astronomers to conduct multi-wavelength
data-incentive research, as the 4th paradigm in astronomy. Young astronomers
are expected to learn about world-wide trend for constructing a wider and
concrete base of their own research.
