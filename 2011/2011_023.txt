> Wide area surveys in nearby molecular clouds are currently ongoing with
> Herschel in the far infrared and APEX in the submillimeter, these will
> soon be complemented and extended with SCUBA2 at the JCMT. They will
> add to the enormous amount of data that will be collected by
> ground-based wide-area surveys with telescopes like VISTA and VST, and
> those already available from other surveys, most notably those carried
> out with Spitzer. These surveys will offer complete samples of objects
> in nearby star forming regions from cores to protostars and young stars
> with unprecedented sensitivity, allowing to probe the physical
> conditions of the sites where the lowest mass isolated objects form.
> Together, these facilities will provide a multi-wavelength view of the
> origin of the full stellar and substellar mass function. In parallel
> detailed studies of individual objects and small samples are already
> ongoing with VLT/I existing and new (e.g. XShooter) instruments and
> with current millimeter interferometers, and shortly will begin with
> ALMA. At the same time, increasingly realistic computations of the
> collapse and fragmentation processes, the early evolution of the
> resulting objects, their inner structure, and the dynamics and
> chemistry of their atmospheres and of their surrounding medium are
> producing a sound framework for the interpretation of observations.
>
> This workshop will review the current progress in our understanding of
> low mass star and brown dwarf formation in nearby molecular clouds, and
> will bring together observers and theoreticians to promote an
> energizing discussion.

> Main topics include

> - Collapse, protostars/protobinaries: theory and observations
> - Early evolutionary stages of VLM stars and BDs: disk mediated accretion

Reminder for ALMA user workshop! Registration deadline extended to Feb 18!

----------------------------------------------------------------
                     ALMA User Workshop

                       Feb 26-27, 2011

    Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Academia Sinica

       http://events.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/workshop/20110226/

            Registration Deadline: Feb 18, 2011

----------------------------------------------------------------
Announcement:

The Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics at Academia Sinica (ASIAA)
announces its second workshop for Taiwanese ALMA users. The workshop is
oriented for all astronomers, regardless of specialty.

The ALMA observatory is in construction at the present, with 9 antennas already 
at the Array Operations Site (AOS). The first call for proposals will be issued 
on March 31, 2011 for the Early Science (ES). This ALMA workshop is designed to 
provide users with the update of ALMA project and the capabilities in the phase 
of ES, and to familiarize users with the (updated) tools for preparing and 
submitting their proposals, along with hands-on exercises, right before the 
call for proposals. An additional workshop will be organized later (likely in 
May) after the call for proposals when the capabilities in the ES phase are 
finalized, and the users are preparing or finishing up their proposals. Note 
that, more workshops will be organized later for observing preparation and data 
reduction, once the users are required to provide the detailed information for 
the execution of the observations.

The organizing committee encourages all the Taiwanese astronomers and
scholars interested in observing with ALMA to take part in this workshop.
Students coming from outside Taipei City/County can apply for travel support
from ASIAA for the transportation and accommodation, and this support is
sponsored by tuCASA. Due to limited space and the hands-on nature of this
workshop, participation will be limited to 80 people.

The program of the workshop will include:

    1. ALMA capabilities in Early Science and Full Operation phases
    2. Observing with ALMA and user supports from ARCs, Taiwan-ARC node, & 
tuCASA
    3. ALMA softwares for preparing, submitting, and tracking proposals: User 
Portal, Help-Desk, Observing Tool, Splatalogue
    4. CASA SIMDATA imaging simulation for observation planning
    5. Hands-on exercise on proposal preparation and submission

Actions

    1. For the participants with less experience in Radio Interferometry,
please attend the ALMA Novice-User Workshop 2010 in advance.
    2. Each participant should have browsed through the presentation files in 
our first ALMA user workshop.
    3. Each participant should have read the ALMA Primer and looked through the 
Science Web pages.
    4. Everyone who is coming to the workshop should try preparing their own 
favorite proposal BEFORE coming to the workshop.
    5. Each participant is encouraged to have worked through a ES SIMDATA 
example (to be provided later).

ASIAA Call for SMA proposals for 2011A

Dear Colleagues,

The ASIAA SMA Time Allocation Committee solicits proposals for
the ASIAA time of the Submillimeter Array (SMA) for the period
from 2011 May 16th to 2011 November 15 (2011A semester).
The ASIAA SMA time is open to those who are affiliated to
a Taiwanese university or a Taiwanese research institute.

The deadline for proposal submission for the ASIAA SMA time
for the 2011A semester is 2011 March 18 (Friday), 4AM in the
morning (Taiwan time).  [The deadline corresponds to March 17
(Thursday) 10AM in Hawaii, USA, and 4PM EST in Cambridge, USA.]

All Taiwanese SMA proposals must be submitted through the SMA
submission facility (http://sma1.sma.hawaii.edu/proposing.html).
New proposers in particular need to get registered (through
the submission web site) before submitting a proposal.
Taiwanese proposers should select "ASIAA" as their destination
TAC in the submission web page.  Please direct your inquiries
(in particular PI eligibility) to TATSUHIKO HASEGAWA
(hasegawa AT asiaa.sinica.edu.tw).

For technical information on the SMA, please visit
       http://sma1.sma.hawaii.edu/proposing.html   .
The SAO SMA information page will be updated for 2011A.
For Taiwan and ASIAA specific aspects (including the PI
eligibility, the ASIAA proposal selection process, and the
amount of available observing time), please visit
        http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/~SMART/  .

A few cautions about proposal format and writing merit reiterating.
- In addition to the page limit, there are limits to the font size
       (11 point or larger) and layout (two pages for text only and two
       pages for figures, tables, and references).
- A request for a good weather without a compelling reason tends to
       get a lower rating from reviewers.

Additional messages from the ASIAA SMA TAC :

A PI (Principal Investigator) should lead the proposed project, and
is expected to be the first author of the resulting papers.  If a PI
will not be able to do these, the PI should provide the reason in the
proposal.  For example, in a multi-wavelength, international campaign,
the PI for an SMA proposal may not be leading the entire project or
going to be the first author.  In such a case, the PI should provide
the background or circumstance in the proposal.

Should a PI become unable to do the work, Co-Is (Co-Investigators)
are expected to follow up the analysis and publication of already
executed or allocated projects under the PI. Co-investigators should
be aware of their responsibilities or obligations.  PIs should make
best efforts to obtain a consent before putting someone's name on a
proposal as a Co-I.

The PI of a successful proposal will be encouraged to provide an
observer at the summit of Mauna Kea.  For more details, please
consult the ASIAA web page listed above.

In order to encourage PhD students to use the SMA, the ASIAA SMA TAC
will make some considerations to proposals for PhD thesis projects.
Please visit the ASIAA web site for details.

The SMA is a complex instrument.  Consultation or collaboration
with those who are familiar with the SMA is recommended.  Contact
points for consultation are also found in the ASIAA web page
listed above.

Sincerely,

Tatsuhiko Hasegawa
on behalf of ASIAA SMA TAC
