Subject: special seminar this Wed by Dr. Jason Rhodes

Dear all,
This Wednesday we will have a special seminar given by Dr. Jason Rhodes from
JPL.  

Jason has been working mainly in the field of weak lensing by large-scale
structure, or cosmic shear, especially from space.  He's pioneered weak lensing
measurements in the Groth Strip, reported the first weak lensing 3D density
field from COSMOS, and has been involved in proposed space missions.  As you may
know, on the day the Nobel prize in physics was announced this year, Euclid, a
dark energy experiment, was selected as the next ESA space mission planned to
fly by 2017-2019.  Jason has been involved in Euclid and is a lead from the US
side.  He is also on the science team of WFIRST, a US-based, supposedly more
powerful, yet unfunded version of Euclid.  A few incarnations back, it was the
SNAP satellite promoted by Dr. Saul Permutter himself.  (There's an interesting
article for the background:
 http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-15180497  )

Jason will tell us first-hand the development and prospects of these space
missions, which will no doubt have profound science impact besides understanding
dark energy.  He will visit us Nov 14-16 -- please let me know if you are
interested in talking with him, and please come to the talk on Wed at 2pm!

Best,
tzu-ching
