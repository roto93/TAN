Dear all, below is the upcoming colloquium at IANCU:


Title: Supenovae as Sources of Interstellar Dust
Speaker: Dr. Takaya Nozawa (IPMU)
Date: 2011-11-29
Time: 15:00-16:00
Location: National Central University, S4-1013

Abstract:
Supernovae (SNe) have been believed to be important producers of interstellar dust. I
present the overview of a series of our works on the calculations of dust formation in
the SN ejecta and dust destruction by the reverse shocks in the SN remnants (SNRs). I
show that the mass of dust injected from SNe into the interstellar medium heavily depend
on the types of SNe and that envelope-stripped SNe such as Type IIb/Ib/Ia are unlikely
to be dominant sources of dust. I also mention the difference in estimate of dust mass
formed in SNe between theory and observation, showing that this difference is getting
resolved by the recent far-infrared observations of nearby SNe and SNRs.
