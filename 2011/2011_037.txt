Dear friends who are interested in SPICA,

We will have the 3rd SPICA Science Meeting on March 17 Thursday,
10:30am-12:00pm, at R1108 in the ASMAB building, ASIAA.
Since the last meeting, we have talked to JAXA for detailed info
about the requirements for collaboration, and what we could get in turn,
and the paper work required for collaboration (Letter of Intent/Agreement, MOU)
and the timeline. We will explain these at the next meeting.

If  we would like scientific collaboration, we also have to contribute to
the other parts of the project, e.g., hardware, software, testing the telescope
and instruments, operation etc. After the above explanation, we will discuss
whether we could make contributions sufficient for a country-country collaboration.
We hope many of you who are interested in SPICA can join the meeting.

best regards,

Shiang-Yu Wang, Yoichi Ohyama, Hiro Takami (ASIAA)
