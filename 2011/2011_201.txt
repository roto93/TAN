Dear Colleagues,

The NTU Physics Department, Center for Condensed Matter Science, Institute
of Atomic and Molecular Sciences, and the Academia Sinica Institute of
Astronomy and Astrophysics invite everyone to our joint colloquium series.
The speakers are all famous international scholars and the colloquia are
aiming at a broad audience, including undergraduate students. Below is the
information of the talk on December 6(Tuesday). Please help to forward this
to the colleagues in your departments.

Best Regards,
Chih-Wei Chang (CCMS)
Jiunn-Wei Chen (NTU Physics)
Jer-Lai Kuo (IAMS)
Wei-Hao Wang (ASIAA)

Speaker: Che-Ting Chan
 Topic: Invisibility: fact or fiction?
Time: 12/06 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:10
Place: Room 104, CCM-New Physics Building

Abstract: Can we make objects invisible? Invisibility has obsessed
humankind for centuries and it is only very recently that researchers have
shown that cloaking is not just fiction: it can be realized in principle
through the development of new artificial materials called metamaterials
and a new mathematical method called transformation optics. In this talk, I
will review a few different strategies to realize invisibility and related
notions. I will show that invisibility can be realized by (i) a special
type of coating which can guide waves around an object, (ii) metamaterials
that can cancel the scattering of other objects, (iii) resonance effect
that can suppress optical excitation, (iv) a zero-refractive index medium
if special boundary conditions are satisfied, and (v) using active sources
to create a quiet zone. The limitations of these each of these approaches
will be discussed.

Brief Bio: C.T. Chan received his B. Sc. degree from the University of Hong
Kong in 1980 and his PhD degree from the University of California at
Berkeley in 1985.  He is currently a Chair Professor of Physics at HKUST,
and the director of William Mong Institute of Nano Science and Technology.
He has been elected a Fellow of the American Physical Society since 1996.
His primary research interest is the simulation and understanding of
material properties. He is now working on the theory a variety of advanced
materials, including photonic crystals, metamaterials and nano-materials.
He has over 200 publications and ~14,000 citations.
