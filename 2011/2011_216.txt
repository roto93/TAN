------ 2nd Announcement ------

Second Announcement of the 1st LeCosPA Symposium (December 20, 2011)

    As the time for the 1st LeCosPA Symposium is gradually approaching, 
we are pleased to update with you its development. So far most of the 
invited Plenary Speaker have made their commitments to attend this 
meeting. In addition we are very pleased to have rapidly filled up the 
slots for invited and contributed speakers in the Parallel Sessions. As 
for the social events, everything has been organized swiftly. We expect 
this meeting to be very exciting indeed.

    In order to further the bases of the participation, we have decided 
to extend the deadline of registration until December 31, 2011. There 
are still rooms for contributed talks in the Parallel Sessions and we 
strongly encourage you to volunteer yourself to share with us your 
latest findings in cosmology and particle astrophysics. In addition, we 
have decided to create a Poster Session to encourage presentations from 
post-docs and students. We have set aside a limited amount of our 
resource to provide financial support for students. Please send us 
message to inquire.

    Please do feel free to ask for our assistance with regard to your 
booking for the hotel accommodation and other logistic issues.

    Sincerely,

LeCosPA2012 Organizing Committee and Staff
