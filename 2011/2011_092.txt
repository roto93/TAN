Subject: Taiwan Mock ALMA Proposal Review - Deadline: June 10th

Dear Colleagues,

With the ALMA proposal deadline on 06/30 fast approaching, prospective users
should get their proposals prepared now. As noted at the recent ALMA user
workshop on 05/21, the ARC Taiwan node will hold a mock ALMA proposal
review.

Recent SMA proposal statistics have shown alarming messages about the
quality of proposals from on-island investigators, and as noted in
the user workshop, the competition of ALMA early science cycle 0 will
be extremely high (with a oversubscription rate possibly exceeding
10!). Thus, only very well-prepared proposals will succeed.

Proposals fail sometimes due to 1) unclear science questions or goals and/or
poorly designed experimenting methods/approaches, but also often due to 2)
poor writing or last minute compilation. The purpose of this review is to
improve the quality of ALMA-T proposals for better success rate by enforcing
potential users to prepare the proposals early, thus, to at least eliminate
the last minute writing and to further sharpen the science ideas.

This mock review is open to all Taiwanese users including the ones outside
of ASIAA. The proposal submission deadline is 2011.06.10. Full proposal,
including scientific and technical justification, figures and tables, is
required to submit to arc@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw in pdf format. Technical
assessment will be carried out by the Taiwan ARC staff. Scientific review
will be conducted through paper by a review panel, including Naomi Hirano,
Shih-Ping Lai, Wei-Hao Wang, Kazushi Sakamoto, and Ciska Kemper.

Technical and scientific review comments will feedback to the PIs through
email a week afterwards on 2011.06.17. Face-to-face discussion with the ARC
staff or review panel members may be considered and arranged. PIs can
incorporate these comments into proposal revision before "true" submission.

Here is the link to the webpage of that annoucement:

and any update will be posted there.

Best Regards,
Chin-Fei
On behalf of TW ARC Node.
