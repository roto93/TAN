First Announcement of the workshop:

Formation and early evolution of very low mass stars and brown dwarfs

Garching, October 11-14, 2011

email: vlms2011@eso.org


Wide area surveys in nearby molecular clouds are currently ongoing with
Herschel in the far infrared and APEX in the submillimeter, these will
soon be complemented and extended with SCUBA2 at the JCMT. They will
add to the enormous amount of data that will be collected by
ground-based wide-area surveys with telescopes like VISTA and VST, and
those already available from other surveys, most notably those carried
out with Spitzer. These surveys will offer complete samples of objects
in nearby star forming regions from cores to protostars and young stars
with unprecedented sensitivity, allowing to probe the physical
conditions of the sites where the lowest mass isolated objects form.
Together, these facilities will provide a multi-wavelength view of the
origin of the full stellar and substellar mass function. In parallel
detailed studies of individual objects and small samples are already
ongoing with VLT/I existing and new (e.g. XShooter) instruments and
with current millimeter interferometers, and shortly will begin with
ALMA. At the same time, increasingly realistic computations of the
collapse and fragmentation processes, the early evolution of the
resulting objects, their inner structure, and the dynamics and
chemistry of their atmospheres and of their surrounding medium are
producing a sound framework for the interpretation of observations.

This workshop will review the current progress in our understanding of
low mass star and brown dwarf formation in nearby molecular clouds, and
will bring together observers and theoreticians to promote an
energizing discussion.

Main topics include

- Properties of nearby molecular clouds and cores forming stars and BDs
- Collapse, protostars/protobinaries: theory and observations
- Early evolutionary stages of VLM stars and BDs: disk mediated accretion
and ejection
- The IMF for stars and BDs and its possible relation with the Clumps MF
- The processes that regulate star formation in GMCs: theory and
observational tests
- Surveys for young very low mass stars and brown dwarfs
