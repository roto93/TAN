Dear Colleagues,

The NTU Physics Department, Center for Condensed Matter Science, Institute
of Atomic and Molecular Sciences, and the Academia Sinica Institute of
Astronomy and Astrophysics invite everyone to our joint colloquium series.
The speakers are all famous international scholars and the colloquia are
aiming at a broad audience, including undergraduate students. Below is the
information of the talk on December 13(Tuesday). Please help to forward
this to the colleagues in your departments.

Best Regards,
Chih-Wei Chang (CCMS)
Jiunn-Wei Chen (NTU Physics)
Jer-Lai Kuo (IAMS)
Wei-Hao Wang (ASIAA)

Speaker: Cheng-Hsuan Chen, CCMS, NTU
  Topic: Visualizing Atoms=A1XWonderful World of Electron Microscopy
Time: 12/13 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:10
Place: Room 104, CCM-New Physics Building

Abstract: Aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy has brought
us an unprecedented spatial resolution below one angstrom making
observation of single atoms a feasible task. In conjunction with advanced
spectroscopies, such as electron energy-loss spectroscopy and
energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, it also becomes possible to
differentiate atoms and carry out chemical and electronic structure mapping
with atomic resolution. In this talk, I=A1=A6ll review recent progress in t=
he
field and its applications in materials science.

 Dear Yi-Jehng,

Please circulate the following announcement for the LOT time request on the
TAN.  Thank you.

Lulin One-meter Telescope (LOT) =97 Call for Observing Proposals for 2012A

Proposal Deadline =97 23:59 January 2 (Monday)  2012


The Lulin One-meter Telescope (LOT) solicits observing proposals for the
semester of 2012A.  The new semester begins on 1 February 2012 and ends
on 31 July 2012.

Those interested in applying for observing time can download the
proposal LaTex package from the web page:
  http://www.astro.ncu.edu.tw/~wchen/lulinprop/lotprop.zip

The completed proposal should contain the filled and compiled version of
the
LaTex file (in PDF or PS format), plus up to two PDF pages of scientific
justification including figures, tables, and references.  The proposal
(cover form and 2-page of scientific case) should be submitted to the
following
email address:
  tac_lulin@astro.ncu.edu.tw
with a copy to me to avoid occasional erroneous delivery:
  wchen@astro.ncu.edu.tw

Please note that in addition to research proposals, we also accept
educational
programs for astronomical observation courses.  Time allocation will be
announced
by mid-January, 2012.

The Observatory management pays particular attention to the scientific
products by
our facilities.  So if you have used the LOT before, please fill in the
status of
the data, and any publications as results of any LOT data.

As usual, there will be two instruments available, the Lulin CCD Imager
(LCI)
and the Lulin Compact Spectrograph (LCS).   In 2012A two more instruments
are
expected to be online on a share-risk basis: (1) TRIPOL, an optical
tri-color
(g'r'i') simultaneous imaging polarimeter, and (2) NCUcam1, an in-house
developed
CCD imager using a fully depleted Hamamatsu detector working up to 1
micron.
Those who would like to know more about TRIPOL and NCUcam1  should contact
the
Lulin staff or me.   You can follow this url to get information regarding
the telescope and instruments,
  http://www.lulin.ncu.edu.tw/lot/

Feel free to direct inquiries about telescope/instrument/site to
Mr Hung-Chin Lin, Manager of the Lulin Observatory, or about time requests
to me (wchen@astro.ncu.edu.tw)

Regards,

Wen Ping Chen
on behalf of the LOT Time Allocation Committee
