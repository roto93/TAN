*** Colloquium
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:	Dr. Dan Werthimer (UC Berkeley Space Science Lab)
Topic:		IS ANYBODY OUT THERE?    The Search for ET with help from Eight Million Volunteers
Time:		3/25 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:		ASMAB R1203
Abstract:
Werthimer will discuss the possibility of 
life in the universe and the search for radio and optical 
signals from other civilizations.  Berkeley's SETI@home 
project analyzes data from the world's largest radio telescope 
using desktop computers from millions of volunteers. 
SETI@home participants have contributed millions of years 
of computer time and have formed one of Earth's most powerful 
supercomputers.  Users have the small but captivating possibility 
their computer will detect the first signal from a civilization 
beyond Earth. 
       Werthimer will also discuss other citizen science projects, 
next generation radio telescopes,  as well as speculate on when 
Earthlings might discover other civilizations.
