Speaker:	Dr. Jonathan Sievers (CITA)
Topic:		Cosmology from 17,000 Feet:  Results from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope
Time:		4/1 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:		ASMAB R1203
Abstract:
The Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) is observing the Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB) from high in the Chilean Andes.  The CMB provides a
snapshot of the universe when it was only 400,000 years old, long
before the formation of any stars or galaxies.  The nearly uniform density
(to a few parts per hundred thousand) means that well understood linear
physics describes the physics of the CMB and lets us reliably tranform
observations of the CMB into constraints on fundamental parameters of
the cosmos.  ACT provides a significant improvement to
our knowledge of the CMB on small (few arcminute) scales.  We present
the results from the first full season of ACT data and what we learn
from them, including better limits on the number of relativistic
species, the initial power spectrum from inflation, early helium density,
potential contributions to structure formation from cosmic strings,
and the imprint of galaxy clusters on the CMB.
