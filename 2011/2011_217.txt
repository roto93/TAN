Dear Colleagues,

The NTU Physics Department, Center for Condensed Matter Science, Institute
of Atomic and Molecular Sciences, and the Academia Sinica Institute of
Astronomy and Astrophysics invite everyone to our joint colloquium series.
The speakers are all famous international scholars and the colloquia are
aiming at a broad audience, including undergraduate students. Below is the
information of the talk on December 27(Tuesday). Please help to forward
this to the colleagues in your departments.

Best Regards,

Speaker: Naoki Kawashima, University of Tokyo
 Topic: Quantum Monte Carlo and Non-Ginzburg-Landau Type Phase Transition
Time: 12/27 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:10
Place: Room 104, CCM-New Physics Building

Abstract: Quantum Monte Carlo is one of powerful tools for clarifying
quantum state of matter. Its applications ranges from quantum magnets to
optical lattices. Here I summarize recent developments in the method and
how it can be implemented in the world fastest computer. I then focus on
how a class of peculiar quantum phase transitions have been discovered by
this method. The transition is realized in the familiar antiferromagnetic
Heisenberg model extended to the SU(N) symmetry.

Brief Bio: Prof. Dr. Kawashima is a professor at Institute for Solid State
Physics, University of Tokyo. He obtained his PhD in physics at Tokyo
University in 1992. After working as a postdoc at Los Alamos National
Laboratory, USA, for 1993-1995, he moved to Toho University (1995-1998) and
Tokyo Metropolitan University (1998-2004). Then he came back to Tokyo
University and has been working there since 2004. He received Ryogo Kubo
Medal in 2002 for his work in quantum Monte Carlo method.
