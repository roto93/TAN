Topic:		Evidence for Radial Inflow in the Extended HI Disk of M83
Time:		7/22 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:		ASMAB R1203
Abstract:
Numerical simulations as well as indirect observational evidence suggest that
typical spiral galaxies are still accreting gas from the cosmic web even at
present days. However, the corresponding mass flow onto the outer disk and the
subsequent inward transport of material has not been observed directly. We
combine interferometric data from the VLA (obtained as part of the THINGS
survey) as well as single dish data from the 100m Effelsberg telescope to
trace the distribution of atomic hydrogen (HI) far into the outskirts of the
nearby spiral galaxy M83. We use these data to search for evidence of gas
accretion of extragalactic origin onto the HI disk of M83. Using a novel
Fourier analysis approach we extract detailed information about the gas
kinematics throughout the HI disk of M83. We find a radial mass flow all the
way from the extreme outer disk to the inner parts of the galaxy where the gas
is consumed by star formation. The amount of material that is transported
inwards is sufficient to form new stars at the observed current rate of
~ 2.5 Msun/yr, allowing the galaxy to evolve in a quasi steady
state. For the first time, we can show that gas accretion and large-scale
radial motions can solve the problem of short gas depletion times in spiral
galaxies.
