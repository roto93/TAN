Lulin One-meter Telescope (LOT) =97 Call for Observing Proposals for 2012A

Proposal Deadline =97 23:59 January 2 (Monday)  2012


The Lulin One-meter Telescope (LOT) solicits observing proposals for the
semester of 2012A.  The new semester begins on 1 February 2012 and ends
on 31 July 2012.

Those interested in applying for observing time can download the
proposal LaTex package from the web page:
  http://www.astro.ncu.edu.tw/~wchen/lulinprop/lotprop.zip

The completed proposal should contain the filled and compiled version of
the
LaTex file (in PDF or PS format), plus up to two PDF pages of scientific
justification including figures, tables, and references.  The proposal
(cover form and 2-page of scientific case) should be submitted to the
following
email address:
  tac_lulin@astro.ncu.edu.tw
with a copy to me to avoid occasional erroneous delivery:
  wchen@astro.ncu.edu.tw

Please note that in addition to research proposals, we also accept
educational
programs for astronomical observation courses.  Time allocation will be
announced
by mid-January, 2012.

The Observatory management pays particular attention to the scientific
products by
our facilities.  So if you have used the LOT before, please fill in the
status of
the data, and any publications as results of any LOT data.

As usual, there will be two instruments available, the Lulin CCD Imager
(LCI)
and the Lulin Compact Spectrograph (LCS).   In 2012A two more instruments
are
expected to be online on a share-risk basis: (1) TRIPOL, an optical
tri-color
(g'r'i') simultaneous imaging polarimeter, and (2) NCUcam1, an in-house
developed
CCD imager using a fully depleted Hamamatsu detector working up to 1
micron.
Those who would like to know more about TRIPOL and NCUcam1  should contact
the
Lulin staff or me.   You can follow this url to get information regarding
the telescope and instruments,

Feel free to direct inquiries about telescope/instrument/site to
Mr Hung-Chin Lin, Manager of the Lulin Observatory, or about time requests
to me (wchen@astro.ncu.edu.tw)

Regards,

Wen Ping Chen
on behalf of the LOT Time Allocation Committee
