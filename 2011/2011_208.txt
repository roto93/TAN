Topic:		What can infrared Interferometry tell us about an AGB Star?
Time:		12/16 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:		 R1203
Abstract:
Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars are the main distributors of dust into the interstellar medium. The wind of these stars is driven by strong stellar pulsation in combination with radiation pressure on dust. High-resolution mid-IR interferometry is sensitive to the structure of the stellar atmosphere and the properties of the dust shell. I will give a short introduction to AGB stars and the interferometric measurement principle, and will present the results obtained for four oxygen-rich AGB stars observed over the course of more than two years. The measured angular diameters in the mid-IR of these stars appear to be about two times larger than their photospheric diameters. The overall larger diameter originates from a warm molecular layer of water, and a detected gradual increase throughout the mid-IR can be attributed to a contribution of a spatially resolved close alumina dust shell.
