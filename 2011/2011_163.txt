Announcement

The Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics at Academia Sinica (ASIAA)
announces its fourth workshop for Taiwanese ALMA users. The workshop is
oriented for astronomers that were granted with observing time for the Cycle
0 Phase, including both the highest priority projects and filler projects.
Please let us know if you really want to attend this workshop.

This ALMA workshop is designed to provide information on the second phase or
Scheduling Blocks (SB) generation. At this stage, one of our ARC members
will be the contact person between the PI and the people in charge of the
Scheduling Blocks generation in the ALMA Regional Center.

In this workshop, there will be lectures for the Phase II procedure,
information about scheduling blocks and some examples.

There will be an open Q&A session for users to consult our ARC members with
their questions.
