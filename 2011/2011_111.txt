Speaker:	Dr. Hsiang-Hsu Wang (ASIAA)
Topic:		Evidence for Radial Inflow in the Extended HI Disk of M83
Time:		7/22 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:		ASMAB R1203
Abstract:
Numerical simulations as well as indirect observational evidence suggest that
typical spiral galaxies are still accreting gas from the cosmic web even at
present days. However, the corresponding mass flow onto the outer disk and the
subsequent inward transport of material has not been observed directly. We
combine interferometric data from the VLA (obtained as part of the THINGS
survey) as well as single dish data from the 100m Effelsberg telescope to
trace the distribution of atomic hydrogen (HI) far into the outskirts of the
nearby spiral galaxy M83. We use these data to search for evidence of gas
accretion of extragalactic origin onto the HI disk of M83. Using a novel
Fourier analysis approach we extract detailed information about the gas
kinematics throughout the HI disk of M83. We find a radial mass flow all the
way from the extreme outer disk to the inner parts of the galaxy where the gas
is consumed by star formation. The amount of material that is transported
inwards is sufficient to form new stars at the observed current rate of
~ 2.5 Msun/yr, allowing the galaxy to evolve in a quasi steady
state. For the first time, we can show that gas accretion and large-scale
radial motions can solve the problem of short gas depletion times in spiral
galaxies.

General:

The International Max Planck Research School (IMPRS) for Astronomy and
Astrophysics, is
funded by the German Max Planck Society and is operated by the Max-
Planck-Institut fu=CC=88r
Radioastronomie (MPIfR) in collaboration with the Argelander-Institut fu=CC=
=88r
Astronomie
(AIfA) of the University of Bonn and the I. Physikalisches Institut at the
University of
Cologne.  It offers three-year financed PhD courses.  The official language
is
English. Currently it hosts roughly 40 students from 17 countries around th=
e
world.


Fields of Research:

The IMPRS for Astronomy and Astrophysics offers a broad spectrum of topics
in
observational and theoretical, galactic and extragalactic astrophysics,
observational and
theoretical cosmology, fundamental physics with astronomical tools and
instrumentation.
Some examples:

AGN Astrophysics =E2=80=93 Structure and Kinematics of AGN Jets =E2=80=93 E=

Besides the expertise in radio astronomy of the MPIfR the IMPRS for
Astronomy and
Astrophysics provides the opportunity for scientific activity in almost all
fields of
contemporary astrophysics, techniques and energy bands. Some examples of
possible topics
can be found at: http://www.mpifr.de/old_mpifr/imprs/projects/
However, it is recommended that the local scientists are contacted for more
details.


Training:

The IMPRS for Astronomy and Astrophysics offers a competitive PhD program o=
n
the basis of
a tightly structured curriculum, including:

=E2=80=A2 Advanced lectures on fundamental astrophysical fields
=E2=80=A2 Soft skill seminars (e.g. presentation skills, time management, s=
cientific
reading)
=E2=80=A2 Weekly students seminars
=E2=80=A2 Annual, =E2=80=9Cstudents-only=E2=80=9D workshop where they devel=
op team activities aside
from their
 main research interests
=E2=80=A2 Colloquia at the three hosting institutions given by experts from=
 all over
the globe
=E2=80=A2 University courses
=E2=80=A2 Thesis committees monitor the progress of each student and provid=
e
scientific feedback
 to the PhD course

Furthermore, the students are strongly encouraged and funded to travel to
international
schools, conferences and the best observing facilities around the world.
They are exposed
to the most advanced techniques and methods using state-of-the-art
earth-bound or space
observatories, such as the unique 100-m radio telescope in Effelsberg and
the most
advanced instruments in millimeter, sub-millimeter and high-energy bands,
such as the APEX
12 m telescope, the Large Binocular Telescope and many more.


Application Procedure:

The call for applications is open until November 15, 2011. Encouraged to

1. More detailed discussion for possible contribution we can make:-
    As summarized before, these include software, testing the entire instrument, commissioning
    and operation, and data center. At the next meeting Yoichi will explain these kinds of things
    for the former Japanese IR mission, Akari.

2. Organizing a workshop for Taiwan and Japan
