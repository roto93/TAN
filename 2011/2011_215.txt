Dear all, below is the information for upcoming colloquium at IANCU;

Title: M87-- "Rosetta Stone" for AGN Jets
Speaker: Dr. Masanori Nakamura (ASIAA)
Date: 2011-12-23
Time: 14:00-15:00
Location: NCU, S4-1013
Abstract:

Acceleration and collimation are the fundamental quest for astrophysical jets, but none
of the system from YSOs to AGNs has exhibited such a simultaneous event in observations.
Based on the multi-frequency VLBI study of the active galactic nucleus M87, we first
present the magnetic acceleration and collimation (MAC) zone of the relativistic
outflow. Our discovery includes i) asymptotic acceleration of the jet flow from
non-relativistic (0.01 c) to relativistic (0.99 c) speed over 10^5 times of the
Schwarzschild radius in a single parabolic streamline, ii) the geometrical transition
from a parabolic (confined) into a conical (unconfined) stream beyond the gravitational
influence of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) and iii) a possible interpretation of
stationary bright component HST-1 as a consequence of the jet over-collimation. We
suggest the propagation of torsional Alfven waves in the jet MAC zone play a role in
transferring the electromagnetic energy, which is generated in the vicinity of the SMBH,
and accelerating the bulk flow towards the speed of light via the conversion of the
Poynting to kinetic energy fluxes. Our results constitute the foundation of the MHD
paradigm of astrophysical jets.

Speaker: Tamiaki Yoneya, University of Tokyo
 Topic: What is String Theory?
Time: 12/20 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:10
Place: Room 104, CCM-New Physics Building

Abstract: String theory has a long history since its birth in the end of
the 1960th. However, we are still in the midst of the process of exploring
true meanings and new outcomes of string theory. In this talk, I would like
to review the development of string theory towards an ultimate unification
of all fundamental interactions including gravity. In particular, special
emphasis is put on the importance of string theory as a possible framework
in which the long standing conflict between quantum theory and general
relativity may be resolved.

Brief Bio: Prof. Tamiaki Yoneya got his PhD at Hokaido University in 1974,
and became a professor at Tokyo University since 1980. He is now an
Emeritus Professor at Tokyo University, and a professor at the Open
University of Japan.
Prof. Yoneya is a pioneer of string theory. He was one of the first persons
who realized that string theory is a theory of quantum gravity. He won the
first Nishinomya-Yukawa Memorial Award in 1986. He also won JPS Award for
Academic Papers in 2007 for his works on the space-time uncertainty
principle.

First Circular

       CPS 9th International School of Planetary Sciences

Date: 24-29 June 2012
Venue: Seapal Suma, a casual seaside resort located in the west part
of Kobe, Japan
Address: 1-1-1 Sumaura-dori, Suma, Kobe 654-0055 Japan
Phone: +81 78 731 6815 / Fax: +81 78 734 1896
Japanese site:
http://www.seapalsuma.com/
English site: http://web.travel.rakuten.co.jp/portal/my/info_page_e.Eng?f_no=13907&f_ptn1=&f_teikei=

Objective and Scope:
The objective of the school/seminar is to promote education and
research in planetary sciences for highly motivated
graduate students and young researchers by providing them with an
opportunity to interact with leading scientists in a
specific field. Note that the term “Planetary Sciences” is used in a
broader sense to include astronomy, astrophysics,
astrochemistry, astrobiology, astromineralogy, geosciences, space
science, cosmology, and other related fields.

Topic of the coming school:
Across the Earth into Exoplanets

Recent wonderful discovery of exoplanets requires us to rethink the
earth and generalize our understandings of the
planet. For the sake of doing so, we should first absorb up-to-date
knowledge about the structure of the earth from the
deep interior to the surface and dynamics producing various geological
and geophysical phenomena. We could then apply
the knowledge to various conditions of planets such as the early
earth, the other planets in the solar system, and
exoplanets. This application enables us to better understand the
coevolution of a solid planet’s interior and its
surface in terms of a search for a habitable exoplanet.

Lectures:
Internationally well-established experts in various fields will review
recent progress in our understandings of those
fields. The lecturers and their topics (tentative) are listed below:

* David J. Stevenson: Theoretical overview of structure and dynamics
of the Earth:
       its particularity and universality
* Shun-ichiro Karato: Earth mantle dynamics from planetary perspective
* Francis Nimmo: Evolution of rocky and icy planets in the solar system
* Philippe Lognonne: Planetary seismology and geophysics
* Taku Tsuchiya: High pressure physics of the Earth and beyond
* Diana Valencia: Earth-like exoplanets: predictions and observations
* TBD: Coupled evolution of the interior and surface environment of
the Earth and planets
* TBD: Earth and planetary magnetism

All the lectures are to be video-recorded and to be available to the
public through the CPS website. Lecture materials
are to be uploaded by each lecturer in PDF format to the CPS server by
30 June 2012 so that they could be viewed on the
same website.

Dear Colleagues,

    We will have the 3rd APCosPA Winter School / Workshop on Cosmology and
Particle
Astrophysics at Department of Physics, National Taiwan University during
13-20 January 2012.
    The pace of the advancement in the area of Cosmology and Particle
Astrophysics (CosPA)
is amazedly fast since the new century. The researchers in the Asia Pacific
region, including
Australia, China, Hawaii, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, and Taiwan, have
played their due roles
in making the progresses. To make our marks more noticeable, we are forming
the Asia Pacific
Organization for Cosmology and Particle Astrophysics (APCosPA
Organization), starting from
nothing but hopefully growing eventually into something fairly visible.
    One beginning is to hold the First APCosPA Winter School, 18-29 January
2010, at National
Taiwan University, Taipei. We intend to cover the various topics in
Cosmology and Particle
Astrophysics but mainly toward the graduate students and young researchers.
    Each lecturer would give three or four lectures, with a couple of hard
problems. And the registered
students or young postdocs could enter the competitions with the awards
given to the first few "students ".

     W-Y. Pauchy Hwang

President, APCosPA Org.
