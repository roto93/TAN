Registration for PASCOS 2011, the 17th International Symposium on
Particles, Strings and Cosmology, is now open.  This conference will be
held in the University of Cambridge's award-winning Centre for
Mathematical Sciences from 3rd to 8th July 2011.  The aim of the
conference is to explore and develop synergies between particle physics,
string theory and cosmology.  This is a particularly timely meeting
given ongoing flagship experiments like the Large Hadron Collider at
CERN and the Planck satellite.  We have booked an international line-up
of 26 speakers, all of them leaders in these fields.

Registration for PASCOS 2011 costs GBP 160 (a discounted rate of GBP 100
applies to PhD students); this includes all talks, the Sunday evening
reception and lunches.  Accommodation and the conference banquet are
charged separately.  If you wish to attend PASCOS 2011, you may register
online by going to:-

http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/research/gr/workshops/PASCOS/2011/

Select the section marked 'Registration', then click on the link 'PASCOS
2011 Online Booking'.  The PASCOS website gives further information on
speakers, accommodation and where to find us.  Any problems, please
e-mail: pascos@damtp.cam.ac.uk.

Please note that places are strictly limited and the meeting is expected
to be over-subscribed, so register early.
