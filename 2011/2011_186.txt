*** Colloquium
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:	Prof. Thomas Henning (MPIA)
Topic:		TBA [* NOTE special time *] The Earliest Stages of Massive Star Formation From Spitzer to Herschel
Time:		11/10 (Thursday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:		 R1203
Abstract:
The talk will discuss progress in our understanding of the earliest stages of massive star formation . The ISO and Spitzer infrared space missions revealed a new class of astronomical objects, the Infrared Dark Clouds (IRDCs). These very cold and dense molecular clouds are potential sites of massive star formation. Their properties will be discussed in the talk. With the successful operation of the Herschel observatory we are now in the position to search for massive pre-stellar cores in the IRDCs. The discovery of the first examples for such objects will be highlighted in the talk.


*** ASIAA/NTU Joint Colloquium
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:	Prof. Thomas Henning (MPIA)
Topic:		Physics of Star Formation
Time:		11/8 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:		 Physics Building R104
Abstract:
Star formation is a fundamental process in the universe, shaping the structure of our and other galaxies. The talk will summarize the general principles of the star formation process. It will discuss global properties such as the star formation efficiency and the initial mass function. In addition, it will also demonstrate the power of adaptive optics in revealing the structure of star-forming regions.

The Department of Physics of Osaka University is calling for
applications to its International Physics Course (IPC).

It offers Master and Ph.D. courses on a wide range of research topics
in Physics (see also the webpage below for more details).

Most successful applicants will receive a scholarship.

Education and research is conducted in English (but students are
welcome to learn a little of Japanese language and culture).

Applications for the admission to academic year 2012/13 (starting from
October 1, 2012) are open from from November 1 to December 10, 2011.
