Arizona Radio Observatory: Call for Proposals (Fall 2011)
------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Astronomers in Taiwan,

UCAT's ARO proposals are being solicited for observing time for the period
October 1, 2011 - February 1, 2012, and the proposal deadline for this
2011 fall semester is set on September 23, 2011 (Friday).

The Arizona Radio Observatory operates the Sub-Millimeter Telescope (SMT) and
the Kitt Peak 12 Meter. The SMT currently supports a dual-polarization, 1 mm
receiver with ALMA Band-6 sideboard-separating mixers, a dual-polarization
0.8 mm receiver, and a 0.4 mm (602-720 GHz) dual-polarization receiver with
ALMA Band-9 mixers. The SMT control system has been updated to allow for dual
polarization, dual sideband observations (so-called "4 IF mode"). The 12 m
supports a dual-polarization 3 mm receivers (82-116 GHz) that employs ALMA
Band-3 sideboard-separating mixers, as well as dual polarization, single
sideboard receivers for the lower part of the 3 mm window (65-86 GHz) and at
2 mm (130-180 GHz). Remote observing is accessible at both ARO telescopes.
Please refer to http://aro.as.arizona.edu/ for more details.

Information about Remote Observing can be viewed at:
http://aro.as.arizona.edu/remote/remote.htm
For further information about remote observing and other operational questions,
please contact Tom Folkers, Operations Manager: tfolkers@as.arizona.edu

People are required to use the 12m and SMT proposal Cover Sheets, attainable at
http://aro.as.arizona.edu/proposals, for their proposals. Proposals should
consist of a proposal Cover Sheet and a brief scientific and technical
justification. The justification may be up to two pages of text, and should NOT
exceed three pages in total including tables, figures, references and a source
list with observing time requirements.

Please pay special attention to the Sun avoidance issue of your proposed
observations. The SMT telescope will not be pointed to within 42 degrees of the
Sun, and the 12 Meter, 15 degrees. In addition, please also provide the IP
number of the computer you will be using during your observing time. 

Electronic submissions to UCAT-ASIAA will be accepted in PDF format only.
Scheduling of successful proposals will be done according to availability of
the receivers requested. Please submit your proposals by midnight (23:59 pm CST)
September 23, 2011 to: kuan @ asiaa.sinica.edu.tw .

Kind regards,
Yi-Jehng Kuan
on behalf of UCAT's ARO TAC
