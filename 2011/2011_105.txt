> The CCAT Science Office announces a meeting on "Formation and Development 
of Molecular Clouds - prospects for high resolution spectroscopy with CCAT" 
to take place at the University of Cologne, Germany, from 5-7 October 2011. 
The goal of the meeting is to get a clear vision of the potential impact of 
CCAT on the field of Formation and Development of Molecular Clouds, both 
Galactic and extragalactic, particularly using high spectral resolution 
instrumentation. The invited speakers have been asked to structure their 
talks with this goal in mind, not only reporting on past or current results 
from their research, but also projecting forward on the role CCAT could play 
in the relevant time frame, particularly in the context of observatories 
such as ALMA and SOFIA.
> 
> Due to space constraints of the meeting rooms, we can host only about 100 
participants, which will be selected on a first come, first serve basis. 
There will be time for a limited number of contributed talks, and space for 
a limited number of posters. These will be selected by the SOC based on the 
submitted abstracts, and should be prepared in the same forward-looking 
spirit as the invited talks. There is no fee for this meeting, but also no 
proceedings. More information on the meeting, logistics, schedule and 
registration as well as the conference poster can be found on the meeting 
website https://www.astro.uni-koeln.de/CologneCCAT     .
> 
> Deadline for registration of contributions is July 31, 2011. 
> Please also note at that time the contingents of blocked rooms
> in some hotels will be released.
> 
> Please distribute this announcement also to other people who might be 
interested.
