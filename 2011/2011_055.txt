Topic: Pure Spin Currents: Discharging Spintronics (Joint colloquium and IEEE
Distinguished Lecture)
Time: 4/12 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:10
Place: Room 104, CCM-New Physics Building

Abstract: As semiconducting electronic devices are miniaturized to ever-smaller
dimensions, power dissipation becomes an ever-increasing problem due to leakage
charge currents. Spintronics may help addressing some of these issues by
utilizing besides the charge degree of freedom also the electron spin.
Conventional spintronics approaches are used for non-volatile devices, such as
magnetic random access memory, where spin currents are mainly considered as
spin-polarized charge currents and as a result the spin and charge currents are
in parallel and directly coupled. Looking further into the future, the question
arises, whether eliminating charge currents altogether could provide additional
benefits for applications. Towards addressing this question, non-local device
geometries allow for separating spin and charge currents, which in turn enables
the investigation and use of pure spin currents. This approach opens up new
opportunities to study spin-dependent physics and gives rise to novel approaches
for generating and controlling angular momentum flow.
This lecture will discuss different approaches for generating pure spin
currents, such as non-local electrical injection from a ferromagnet,
charge-to-spin current conversion via spin Hall effects, and spin pumping from
ferromagnetic resonance. Furthermore, examples will be shown for how spin
currents can be used for gaining new insights into spin dependent phenomena. In
particular, the temperature dependence of spin and charge relaxation times
allows to identify different spin relaxation mechanisms. In addition, spin
pumping facilitates the generation of macroscopically large pure spin currents.
This permits to quantify spin Hall effects with great precision, even in
materials where these effects are relatively weak. Finally, the lecture will
conclude with a brief outlook on the current scientific and future technological
opportunities for pure spin currents.

Brief Bio: Dr. Hoffmann's research interests encompass a wide variety of
magnetism related subjects, including basic properties of magnetic
heterostructures, spin-transport in novel geometries, and biomedical
applications of magnetism. He has more than 100 publications, four book
chapters, and three magnetism-related U.S. patents. He is an associate editor
for the Journal of Applied Physics, a senior IEEE member and a member of the
Advisory Committee for the IEEE Magnetics Society.
