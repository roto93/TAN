Attention: Yi-Jehng Kuan, Professor and Chair
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Department of Earth Sciences of National Taiwan Normal University invites
applications for a faculty position in astronomy to begin Fall 2012. Candidates
in all areas of astronomy and astrophysics will be considered. We are
particularly interested in candidates working in developing cross-disciplinary
projects within the department of Earth Sciences, for instance in the fields of
comparative planetology or space weather. The position is expected to be at the
Assistant Professor level, but a higher level appointment may be considered for
exceptionally qualified candidates.

The Astronomy group of the department has a close research tie with Academia
Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA). Members of the group
lead active programs in astrobiology, astrochemistry, binary stars, stellar
clusters, galaxy evolution, Active Galactic Nuclei and clusters of galaxies.
NTNU astronomy faculty currently enjoy access to large number of facilities
such as ALMA, SMA, SMT, KP12M, Subaru and CFHT. Computational facilities at the
department of Earth Sciences include the Taiwan Extragalactic Astronomical Data
Center, with large storage dedicated to Virtual Observatory, and two clusters
with 32 and 54 cores respectively, dedicated to atmospheric and oceanographic
simulations.

The appointees should have a demonstrated record in research and a commitment to
excellence in undergraduate and graduate teaching. Preference will be given to
individuals whose interests, abilities, and experience benefit our existing
programs. Candidates should have a Ph.D. in Astronomy, Astrophysics, Planetary
Sciences, Physics or a closely related field, and preferably have post-doctoral
experience. Email inquiries may be addressed to: Sebastien Foucaud
(foucaud@ntnu.edu.tw).

Applicants should submit a cover letter, a current curriculum vita, a list of
publications, an outline of present research accomplishments and future research
plans, a teaching statement, and a photocopy of doctorate diploma, directly to
Prof. Yi-Jehng Kuan at the above address. Applicants should also arrange for
three letters of recommendation to be sent to the same address. Complete
applications should be received by February 29, 2012 for full consideration.

  TIARA Workshop on the Transient Universe
  December 12-16, 2011
  https://www.tiara.sinica.edu.tw/activities/workshop/20111212/

  TIARA, 8F General Building II, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu
##############################################################

The theme of this workshop is on the transient variability of cosmic
phenomena on both small and large scales, their observations, theories
and diagnostic probes. Topics include gamma ray bursts, tidal
disruption events, gamma ray and x-ray binaries, radio transients,
oscillations in black hole accretion disks, ultraluminous X-ray
sources, stellar mergers, and variability in extragalactic jet
sources.

To maximize the interactions between the speakers and local
astronomers we encourage participation from interested scientists from
local institutes and universities.

The emphasis of the workshop will be on discussions rather than formal
presentations. Hence, several talks are scheduled per day, with the
rest of the time devoted to informal discussions and working sessions.

    * Edo Berger (Harvard University)
    * Josh Bloom (University of California, Berkeley)
    * Phil Charles (University of Southampton)

Abstract: http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/activity/colloquium.php

*** Colloquium
____________________________________________________
Speaker:       Prof. Shude Mao (NAOC/University of Manchester)
Topic:           Strong gravitational lensing by galaxies"
Time:           11/18 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
I will review the basic concepts of strong gravitational lensing by
galaxies. I will mainly focus on the current status of its applications on
substructures within the lens galaxies and those along the line of sight. I
will also briefly mention some other potential applications including the
discovery of multiple black holes using gravitational lensing and finish
with a brief look into the future.


*** Special Seminar
____________________________________________________
Speaker:        Dr. Jason Rhode (NASA JPL)
Topic:          WFIRST and Euclid
Time:           11/16 (Wednesday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
The past decade has seen tremendous progress in astronomy that has brought
us to the brink of being able to answer two very fundamental questions:
What is the Universe made of?
Are we alone?
The first question can only be answered by trying to understand the
mysterious =93dark energy=94 causing the accelerated expansion of the Unive=
rse.
 This dark energy, the dominant constituent of the Universe, has a number
of possible theoretical explanations, ranging from a cosmological constant,
to possible modifications to Einstein=92s General Theory of Relativity. The
second question is motivated by the increasing frequency of detections of
exoplanets and can be explored by seeking out the frequency of Earth-like
planets in the habitable zone of stars similar to the sun.   Both of these
science goals can be best explored with a space-based wide-field telescope
capable of imaging and spectroscopy.  Such a platform, operating in optical
to near infrared wavelengths would also make great strides in a myriad of
ancillary astrophysical areas, including the evolution of galaxies and
structures over two thirds of the age of the Universe. The European Space
Agency is in the final!
 stages of examining the Euclid mission, which is optimized to study dark
matter and dark energy.  NASA has begun planning for the Wide Field
Infrared Survey Telescope designed to explore dark energy and perform an
exoplanet survey.  I=92ll discuss the scientific motivations of both missio=
ns
and give an overview of the hardware, observing strategy and status of each
mission.

> Subject: special seminar this Wed by Dr. Jason Rhodes

Dear all,


This Wednesday we will have a special seminar given by Dr. Jason Rhodes from JPL.  


Jason has been working mainly in the field of weak lensing by large-scale structure, or cosmic shear, especially from space.  He's pioneered weak lensing measurements in the Groth Strip, reported the first weak lensing 3D density field from COSMOS, and has been involved in proposed space missions.  As you may know, on the day the Nobel prize in physics was announced this year, Euclid, a dark energy experiment, was selected as the next ESA space mission planned to fly by 2017-2019.  Jason has been involved in Euclid and is a lead from the US side.  He is also on the science team of WFIRST, a US-based, supposedly more powerful, yet unfunded version of Euclid.  A few incarnations back, it was the SNAP satellite promoted by Dr. Saul Permutter himself.  (There's an interesting article for the background:  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-15180497  )


Jason will tell us first-hand the development and prospects of these space missions, which will no doubt have profound science impact besides understanding dark energy.  He will visit us Nov 14-16 -- please let me know if you are interested in talking with him, and please come to the talk on Wed at 2pm!


Best,
tzu-ching
