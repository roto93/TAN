Dear all,

We organize one-day science workshop for SPICA on October 13 (Thu)
at ASIAA, ASMAB R1203. The goal of the meeting is for us to clarify
what we could do, and what we would like to do, using SPICA.

The workshop will include:
(1) review of the latest status of SPICA from JAXA colleagues (TBD),
(2) invited review talks from Taiwan colleagues on each potentially
      interesting SPICA topics (see below),
(3) a few contributed talks (20 min. with discussion for another 10 minutes)
      for more specific research topics for which SPICA can explore, and
(4) discussion to strengthen our science cases.

Invited review speakers and topics:
Professor Wing-Huen Ip  (NCU, Comets & Solar system)
Dr. Tatsuhiko Hasegawa (ASIAA, Astrochemistry)
Dr. Ciska Kemper              (ASIAA, Dust mineralogy)
Dr. Seb Faucaud               (NTNU,  Distant galaxies)
Dr. Vivien Chen                 (NTHU, Star formation)

If you are interested in attending, please e-mail your name,
position and institution to Hiro Takami (hiro@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw)
by October 4 (Tue) so that we will be able to arrange lunch. If you are
willing to give a contributed talk, please let Hiro know by the same date.

We hope many of you are interested in this space telescope project!

best regards, Ciska Kemper, Shiang-Yu Wang, Yoichi Ohyama and Hiro Takami

Abstract: http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/activity/colloquium.php

*** Colloquium
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:	Dr. Masaaki Otsuka (ASIAA)
Topic:		Dust production in Planetary Nebulae
Time:		9/30 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:		 R1203
Abstract:
Planetary Nebulae (PNe) represent a final stage in the evolution of
low- to intermediate-mass stars with initially 1-8  solar mass; at the
end of its life,
a star of such mass evolves first into a red giant branch star, then
an asymptotic giant branch star, and a PN. Dust production in the
Milky Way galaxy predominantly comes from mass-loss during these end
stages of stellar evolution. However, our understanding of dust
creation and evolution largely comes from stars with metallicity close
to the solar value. As sensitive observations of
dust at lower metallicity are made in distant galaxies, it is
imperative that we understand and characterize dust production at low
metallicity within our own
galactic environment. LMC PNe are ideal targets to study dust
production and (dust) mass-loss rate in low- to intermediate-mass
stars. Since the distance to
the LMC is well determined and they evolved from stars with different
metallicity, composition, and initial mass, we can estimate dust mass
with less uncertainly and we can discuss relations between dust mass
and properties of an ionized nebula and the progenitor star.  I have
been estimating dust mass in LMC PNe based on the data taken by
Spitzer legacy projects SAGE and SAGE-Spec. I will show results of LMC
PN dust and introduce ongoing other projects on dust in PNe.

Dear IAU Members, 

Very many thanks to those who replied to our call for volunteers interested in contributing to "Astronomy for a Better World." The reaction has been very encouraging. 

This is to draw your attention to the opportunity for organisations, institutes and astronomy departments to contribute to future IAU "Astronomy for Development" activities and the OAD workshop to discuss this in Cape Town from 12 - 14 December. See: http://iau.org/static/education/oad/message_to_organisations_sep2011.pdf   

We would be grateful if you would bring this to the attention of your organisation. 

Thanks again for your help.
