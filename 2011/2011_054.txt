Topic:		On the Formation of the Most Massive Stars in the Galaxy
Time:		4/8 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:		ASMAB R1203
Abstract:
The 'really' massive stars (those with more than 10 to 20 solar masses) likely start to ionize their surroundings before they reach their final mass. How can they accrete in spite of the presence of over-pressurized gas? We present results of Submillimeter Array (SMA) and Very Large Array (VLA) studies of massive-star formation regions in the early stages of ionization: Molecular-line observations at resolutions from a few arcsec to 0.3 arcsec reveal the presence of rotation, infall, and/or outflow from parsec scales to <0.05 pc. Small groups of massive (proto)stars are found at different evolutionary stages. The innermost ionized gas is sometimes found to have organized motions, probably in the form of outflow and/or rotation. Multiepoch observations of the free-free continuum reveal significant flux variations in timescales of years, attributable to interactions with the surrounding molecular gas. These observations, as well as recent models and numerical simulations of HI!
 I region evolution in star-forming accretion flows, favor a picture in which: i) These very massive stars form in accretion flows that are partially ionized. ii) The cores from which these stars form keep accreting material from their enviroment (clump).
