*** Colloquium
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:	Dr. Clive Dickinson (University of Manchester)
Topic:		Early Planck Results in the Galaxy
Time:		4/22 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:		ASMAB R1203
Abstract:
I will give an overview of the Planck mission and the recent Early Planck Results papers (submitted to A&A January 2011). I will present the results of the Galactic papers from these early papers, focussing on the Anomalous Microwave Emission (AME). Data from Planck, combined with ancillary data (WMAP, radio data, DIRBE etc.), has allowed us to construct precise spectra for Galactic regions such as Perseus and Rho Ophiuchus molecular clouds. The spectra show strong evidence for AME, which can be readily fitted by electric dipole radiation from small spinning dust grains.
