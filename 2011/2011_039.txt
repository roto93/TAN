Reminder: ASIAA Call for SMA proposals for 2011A

Dear Colleagues,

This is a kind reminder that:

The deadline for proposal submission for the ASIAA SMA time
for the 2011A semester is 2011 March 18 (Friday), 4AM in the
morning (Taiwan time).  [The deadline corresponds to March 17
(Thursday) 10AM in Hawaii, USA, and 4PM EST in Cambridge, USA.]

All Taiwanese SMA proposals must be submitted through the SMA
submission facility (http://sma1.sma.hawaii.edu/proposing.html).
New proposers in particular need to get registered (through
the submission web site) before submitting a proposal.
Taiwanese proposers should select "ASIAA" as their destination
TAC in the submission web page.  Please direct your inquiries
(in particular PI eligibility) to TATSUHIKO HASEGAWA
(hasegawa AT asiaa.sinica.edu.tw).

For technical information on the SMA, please visit
       http://sma1.sma.hawaii.edu/proposing.html   .
The SAO SMA information page will be updated for 2011A.
For Taiwan and ASIAA specific aspects (including the PI
eligibility, the ASIAA proposal selection process, and the
amount of available observing time), please visit
       http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/~SMART/  .

A few cautions about proposal format and writing merit reiterating.
- In addition to the page limit, there are limits to the font size
      (11 point or larger) and layout (two pages for text only and two
      pages for figures, tables, and references).
- A request for a good weather without a compelling reason tends to
      get a lower rating from reviewers.


Sincerely,

Tatsuhiko Hasegawa
on behalf of ASIAA SMA TAC

Dear friends who are interested in SPICA,

We will have the 3rd SPICA Science Meeting on March 17 Thursday,
10:30am-12:00pm, at R1108 in the ASMAB building, ASIAA.
Since the last meeting, we have talked to JAXA for detailed info
about the requirements for collaboration, and what we could get in turn,
and the paper work required for collaboration (Letter of Intent/Agreement, MOU)
and the timeline. We will explain these at the next meeting.

If  we would like scientific collaboration, we also have to contribute to
the other parts of the project, e.g., hardware, software, testing the telescope
and instruments, operation etc. After the above explanation, we will discuss
whether we could make contributions sufficient for a country-country collaboration.
We hope many of you who are interested in SPICA can join the meeting.

best regards,

Shiang-Yu Wang, Yoichi Ohyama, Hiro Takami (ASIAA)

Abstract: http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/activity/colloquium.php

*** Colloquium
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:	Prof. Rachel Webster (University of Melbourne)
Topic:		The Epoch of Reionisation: the MWA Experiment
Time:		3/11 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:		ASMAB R1203
Abstract:
The birth of the first stars and black holes is currently unobservable, buried in a sea of neutral Hydrogen in a time we currently call the ???Dark Ages???.  Detailed numerical simulations predict the sequence of events which may have unfolded, but we do not yet know when the first sources turned on, nor what their characteristics were.  There are two wavebands which appear to be promising for the first observations: the infrared and long radio wavelengths.  This talk will describe the expected radio signatures  of redshifted 21cm emission from Hydrogen, and the new telescopes which are attempting to detect these signals. In addition, a description will be given of some of the potential science which will be accessible once the web of 21cm emission is observed.
