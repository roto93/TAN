Abstract: http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/activity/colloquium.php

*** Colloquium
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:	Dr. Jonathan Sievers (CITA)
Topic:		Cosmology from 17,000 Feet:  Results from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope
Time:		4/1 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:		ASMAB R1203
Abstract:
The Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) is observing the Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB) from high in the Chilean Andes.  The CMB provides a
snapshot of the universe when it was only 400,000 years old, long
before the formation of any stars or galaxies.  The nearly uniform density
(to a few parts per hundred thousand) means that well understood linear
physics describes the physics of the CMB and lets us reliably tranform
observations of the CMB into constraints on fundamental parameters of
the cosmos.  ACT provides a significant improvement to
our knowledge of the CMB on small (few arcminute) scales.  We present
the results from the first full season of ACT data and what we learn
from them, including better limits on the number of relativistic
species, the initial power spectrum from inflation, early helium density,
potential contributions to structure formation from cosmic strings,
and the imprint of galaxy clusters on the CMB.

Subject: Call for Proposals - ALMA Early Science Cycle 0

Dear Colleagues,

The ALMA Director is very pleased to issue this Call for Proposals for 
ALMA Early Science Cycle 0. An announcement of the call is attached. All 
the details are available at the newly-opened ALMA Science Portal at

http://www.almascience.org

which is jointly provided by the ALMA Regional Centers operated by the ALMA
Partners.

This marks a significant point in the history the ALMA project, which can 
trace its genesis to a meeting that took place in February 1983, just over 
28 years ago. We would like to acknowledge the contributions made by the 
many people from all over the world who have worked to develop and realize 
the ALMA dream, and those that continue to work towards its successful 
completion and operation.

With best wishes.
Thijs & Lewis
