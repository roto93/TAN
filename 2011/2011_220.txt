Dear all,

We are pleased to announce a call for proposal of CHFT Large Program  
(LP) for 2013A-2016B. Dead line for submission is February 28, 2012  
at 23:59 UTC.

http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/en/science/LP_13_16/

We encourage all of you to check the above call for proposal page  
carefully, but here I note some Taiwan-specific points.

Since a LP requires at least 200 hours per program and our (Taiwan's)  
resources on CFHT is very limited (roughly 40 hours per semester,  
which should be shared also by all PI programs), Taiwan can not be a  
PI of a program in practice. However, this does not prevent us to  
participate in such programs as a smaller partner in a multi-agency  
(Canada, France as well as Brazil, China, and Taiwan) program. In  
such a multi-agency collaboration framework, you can ask CFHT Taiwan  
(CFHT-T) TAC to add some hours to enhance the entire LP program.

Potential participants need to talk with major partners (either from  
Canada or France), discuss in detail how the entire project team is  
formed and how Taiwan participants join the team, and then figure out  
how many hours you request to the CFHT-T resources. Careful  
consideration is requited on how to share the responsibility, man  
power contribution to the project, etc., AND share the nights/hours.

Such proposals will go to Large Program Agency Review Committee  
(LPARC), a dedicated evaluation committee for LPs, not to CFHT-T TAC,  
and all aspects of the proposal evaluation (science merit,  
experimental design, technical feasibility, human resources to  
conduct the large program, etc.) will be made there. Note, however,  
that CFHT-T TAC will also receive the proposal through the LPARC and  
will examine the use of Taiwan resources to the program. If the CFHT- 
T TAC finds that the program requires too much Taiwan resources with  
respect to expected contribution from Taiwan astronomers to the  
project or whatever that is judged not appropriate for the use of  
CFHT-T resources, we will send a comment to the LPARC and it will be  
seriously considered in the LPARC.


Here are some additional notes:

Due to expected legacy nature of the LPs, we strongly encourage  
Taiwan astronomers to form some local group/team to join some multi- 
agency LP, not just join it as a single astronomer. This, upon  
successful formation of such a Taiwan group, may enhance  
justification to ask CFHT-T resources for the LP.

Once we spend some hours to any LPs, hours allocatable for regular PI  
programs will be reduced by the same amount. Therefore the CFHT-T TAC  
will put some upper limit on allocatable hours for the LPs.

If Taiwan participants of any LP programs submit yet another PI  
program to regular CFHT-T nights in semesters when the LP is running,  
the CFHT-T TAC may take this into account in the time allocation of  
such PI programs.

Since we have not yet experienced any LP nights/hours allocations in  
the past, the CFHT-T TAC may need to consider additional issues in  
future for better and proper assignment of the LP nights/hours from  
CFHT-T resources.


Any questions on this issue should be sent to me  
(ohyama@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw) as a CFHT-T TAC chair.

Best wishes,
  Youichi Ohyama
  CFHT-T TAC chair, ASIAA
