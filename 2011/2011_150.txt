Dear all,

We organize one-day science workshop for SPICA on October 13 (Thu)
at ASIAA, ASMAB R1203. The goal of the meeting is for us to clarify
what we could do, and what we would like to do, using SPICA.

The workshop will include:
(1) review of the latest status of SPICA from JAXA colleagues (TBD),
(2) invited review talks from Taiwan colleagues on each potentially
      interesting SPICA topics (see below),
(3) a few contributed talks (20 min. with discussion for another 10 minutes)
      for more specific research topics for which SPICA can explore, and
(4) discussion to strengthen our science cases.

Invited review speakers and topics:
Professor Wing-Huen Ip  (NCU, Comets & Solar system)
Dr. Tatsuhiko Hasegawa (ASIAA, Astrochemistry)
Dr. Ciska Kemper              (ASIAA, Dust mineralogy)
Dr. Seb Faucaud               (NTNU,  Distant galaxies)
Dr. Vivien Chen                 (NTHU, Star formation)

If you are interested in attending, please e-mail your name,
position and institution to Hiro Takami (hiro@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw)
by October 4 (Tue) so that we will be able to arrange lunch. If you are
willing to give a contributed talk, please let Hiro know by the same date.

We hope many of you are interested in this space telescope project!

best regards, Ciska Kemper, Shiang-Yu Wang, Yoichi Ohyama and Hiro Takami
