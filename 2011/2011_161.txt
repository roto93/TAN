Dear Colleagues,

The NTU Physics Department, Center for Condensed Matter Science, Institute
of Atomic and Molecular Sciences, and the Academia Sinica Institute of
Astronomy and Astrophysics invite everyone to our joint colloquium series.
The speakers are all famous international scholars and the colloquia are
aiming at a broad audience, including undergraduate students. Below is the
information of the talk on October 11 (Tuesday). Please help to forward thi=
s
to the colleagues in your departments.

Best Regards,
Chih-Wei Chang (CCMS)
Jiunn-Wei Chen (NTU Physics)
Jer-Lai Kuo (IAMS)
Wei-Hao Wang (ASIAA)

Speaker: Lennox Cowie, University of Hawaii
 Topic: Growing Galaxies from Start to Finish
Time: 10/11 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:10
Place: Room 104, CCM-New Physics Building

Abstract: Over the past two decades we have begun to understand how galaxie=
s
and their supermassive black holes form and evolve from the earliest times
to the present.  I will sketch how the development of new facilities in
space and on the ground for observing at X-ray, UV/optical, and far-infrare=
d
wavelengths has driven this transformation in our understanding.  I will
also discuss some unresolved problems, such as where the photons needed to
ionize hydrogen in the intergalactic gas are produced, why supermassive
black holes form so early in the galaxy evolution process, and how much of
early galaxy formation is obscured by dust.
