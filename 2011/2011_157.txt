Speaker: Shing-Tung Yau, Harvard

 Topic: Math, Physics, and Calabi=A1VYau Manifolds
Time: 10/04 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:10
Place: Room 104, CCM-New Physics Building

Abstract: I=A1=A6d like to talk about how mathematics and physics can come
together to the benefit of both fields, particularly in the case of
Calabi-Yau spaces and string theory. This happens to be the subject of the
new book I coauthored, THE SHAPE OF INNER SPACE, It also tells some of my
own story and a bit of the history of geometry as well.

*** Colloquium
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:	Prof. Len Cowie (University of Hawaii)
Topic:		Lyman alpha emitters from redshifts zero to seven
Time:		10/7 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:		 R1203
Abstract:
In studying very high redshifts we only have two diagnostics: the UV continuum and the Lyman alpha emission line. The fraction of Lyman alpha emitters (LAEs) relative to UV-continuum sources has been suggested as a potential diagnostic of the evolution in the properties of the intergalactic gas.  However, our understanding of the mechanisms governing the escape of Lyman alpha photons from galaxies is poor. I will discuss recent low redshift studies which allow us to study the properties of the LAES in great detail and which have found that LAEs are chosen from young and low-metallicity galaxies, so we might expect a high fraction of galaxies to be LAEs at very high redshifts.  However, the current data on the fraction of galaxies that are LAEs at z>6 are confused.  It may be that the fraction at z~6.5 is almost identical to that at z~3, which would suggest that we have not yet hit the point where the LAE fraction begins to change.  Deep X-ray studies also do not seem to show!
  much evidence for metal evolution, but we cannot quite get to the highest redshift (z~6) sources, even with the 4 Ms Chandra data.


*** Special Seminar

Speaker:	Prof. Evgeny (Uri) Griv (Ben-Gurion University of the Negev)
Topic:		Waves and Their Instabilities in Astrophysical Disks
Time:		10/4 (Tuesday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:		 R1203
Abstract:
Self-gravitating disk systems (disk-shaped galaxies, disks around massive
objects, protostellar and protoplanetary clouds, planetary rings) are of
great interest in astrophysics because of their widespread appearance. Such
rapidly and nonuniformly rotating flat systems are highly dynamic and are
subject to various collective instabilities of small-amplitude gravity
perturbations (e.g., those produced by a spontaneous disturbance or, in rare
cases, a companion system). This is because their evolution is primarily
driven by angular momentum redistribution. The system may then fall toward
the lower potential energy configuration and use the energy so gained to
increase its coarse grained entropy. In this talk, I review recent studies
of dynamics of astrophysical disks with special emphasis on their ring
and/or spiral structures. I show that because of the long-range nature of
the gravitational forces between particles, a self-gravitating disk exhibits
collective (or cooperative) modes of motion -- waves in which the particles
in large regions move coherently or in unison. The evolution of strophysical
disks would depend on the ring and spiral structures produced in the system
through internal instabilities of waves. The extent to which our results on
the disk's stability can have a bearing on observable astrophysical disks is
discussed as well.
