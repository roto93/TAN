Associated Universities, Inc. (AUI) invites nominations and applications for
the position of Director of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory. AUI is
a not-for-pro?t corporation headquartered in Washington, D.C. founded in 1946
to operate scientific research facilities that serve universities and the
public interest. AUI operates NRAO under a Cooperative Agreement with the
National Science Foundation.

NRAO's mission is to enable forefront research into the Universe at radio
wavelengths. In partnership with the scientific community, the Observatory:
provides world-leading telescopes, instrumentation and expertise; conducts
research; helps train the next generation of scientists and engineers; and
promotes astronomy to foster a more scientifically literate society. 

Dr. Fred Lo has served as Observatory Director since 2002, during which time
he has overseen the construction of the Expanded Very Large Array (EVLA), the
commissioning of the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope, and the construction
of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). EVLA started early
science observations in 2010, and ALMA will be starting early science this year.
In order to give his successor maximum opportunity to participate, through these
transitions, in shaping the next exciting era in NRAO??s nearly 60-year
history, Dr. Lo has announced that he will step down as soon as a new NRAO
director is in place. The Board is grateful for Dr. Lo??s leadership of
NRAO over the very fruitful past decade, and thanks him for his accomplishments
in completing the new facilities and advancing NRAO??s position as a
world-leading radio astronomy observatory.

The next NRAO Director will be responsible for leading and managing this large
national enterprise in support of the entire astronomical community and helping
sustain robust and effective scientific programs for the benefit of the nation,
as well as for overseeing NRAO outreach activities that extend benefits of the
science to the broader public. The Director will manage the transition of NRAO's
major new facilities into routine operations over the next few years, as well as
the continued development of NRAO itself as an observatory that meets the
scientific community??s, and the nation??s, most advanced facility,
technology, and operational needs in the next decade. 

The NRAO Director coordinates with North America's partners in ALMA, including
the Directors General of the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan and the
European Southern Observatory, as well as with Canada's Herzberg Institute of
Astrophysics, and Taiwan??s Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and
Astrophysics. The NRAO Director is expected to be a leading participant in
formulating and executing national priorities for research in radio astronomy
and in astronomy more broadly.

Candidates should be scientists of stature who fully understand current
developments in world astronomy. The Director must have excellent scientific
credentials, be recognized as a leader, have significant successful experience
in management of research organizations and display the specific sensitivities
needed to lead a national research facility. He or she must exhibit leadership
informed by a broad understanding of the evolving context of astronomical
science and the national and international research enterprise.

The search committee will begin considering applications this month and will
continue to accept applications until the position is filled. 

Inquiries, nominations, and applications should be sent to
