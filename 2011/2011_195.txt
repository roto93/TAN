*** Colloquium
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Prof. Tetsuya Nagata (Kyoto University)
Topic:        Cepheid variables and star formation in the Galactic center from IRSF observations at SAAO
Time:        11/25 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
I will present near-infrared observations of the Galactic center region
with our Infrared Survey Facility (IRSF) 1.4-m telescope at South
African Astronomical Observatory.  From the observations, we recently
found three classical Cepheids in the nuclear bulge with pulsation
periods of approximately 20 days, within 40 parsecs (projected distance)
of the super massive black hole at the Galactic center.  No Cepheids
with longer or shorter periods were found.  We infer that there was a
period about 25 Myr ago, and possibly lasting until recently, in which
star formation increased relative to the period of 30-70 Myr ago.  The
timescale of such episodic star formation might be comparable with that
of the cyclic gas accumulation predicted for the central part of the
Milky Way.
