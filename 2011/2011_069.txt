Subject: ASIAA/NTU CCMS/NTU Physics Joint Colloquium, May 3

Dear Colleagues,

The NTU Physics Department, NTU Center for Condensed Matter Science, and the
Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics invite everyone to our
joint colloquium series. The speakers are all famous international scholars and
the colloquia are aiming at a broad audience, including undergraduate students.
Below is the information of the talk on May 3 (Tuesday). Please help to forward
this to the colleagues in your departments.

Best Regards,
Jiunn-Wei Chen (NTU Physics)

Speaker: Oliver Gutfleisch, IFW Dresden
Topic: Magnetic Materials in Sustainable Energy
Time: 5/3 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:10
Place: Room 104, CCM-New Physics Building

Abstract: A new energy paradigm, consisting of greater reliance on renewable
energy sources and increased concern for energy efficiency in the total energy
lifecycle, has accelerated research in energy-related technologies. Due to their
ubiquity, magnetic materials play an important role in improving the efficiency
and performance of devices in electric power generation, conversion and
transportation. Magnetic materials are essential components of energy
applications (i.e. motors, generators, transformers, actuators, etc.) and
improvements in magnetic materials will have significant impact in this area, on
par with many “hot” energy materials efforts (e.g. hydrogen storage, batteries,
thermoelectrics, etc.).
The lecture focuses on the state-of-the-art hard and soft magnets and
magnetocaloric materials with an emphasis on their optimization for energy
applications. Specifically, the impact of hard magnets on electric motor and
transportation technologies, of soft magnetic materials on electricity
generation and conversion technologies, and of magnetocaloric materials for
refrigeration technologies, will be discussed.
The synthesis, characterization, and property evaluation of the materials, with
an emphasis on structure-property relationships, will be examined in the context
of their respective markets as well as their potential impact on energy
efficiency.
Finally, considering future bottle-necks in raw materials and in the supply
chain, options for recycling of rare-earth metals will be analysed.

Brief Bio: Dr. Gutfleisch is a research fellow and the "Functional Magnetic
Materials and Hydrides" group leader at IFW Dresden. He is also a visiting
professor of the Imperial College London, and a visiting advisor of NIMS
Tsukuba. He has 180 publications in refereed journals in high performance
permanent magnets for E-mobility and energy applications, magnetocaloric
materials and magnetic cooling, ferromagnetic shape memory alloys, and solid
state hydrogen storage.
