Dear all, below is the information for upcoming colloquium at IANCU;

Title: M87-- "Rosetta Stone" for AGN Jets
Speaker: Dr. Masanori Nakamura (ASIAA)
Date: 2011-12-23
Time: 14:00-15:00
Location: NCU, S4-1013
Abstract:

Acceleration and collimation are the fundamental quest for astrophysical jets, but none
of the system from YSOs to AGNs has exhibited such a simultaneous event in observations.
Based on the multi-frequency VLBI study of the active galactic nucleus M87, we first
present the magnetic acceleration and collimation (MAC) zone of the relativistic
outflow. Our discovery includes i) asymptotic acceleration of the jet flow from
non-relativistic (0.01 c) to relativistic (0.99 c) speed over 10^5 times of the
Schwarzschild radius in a single parabolic streamline, ii) the geometrical transition
from a parabolic (confined) into a conical (unconfined) stream beyond the gravitational
influence of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) and iii) a possible interpretation of
stationary bright component HST-1 as a consequence of the jet over-collimation. We
suggest the propagation of torsional Alfven waves in the jet MAC zone play a role in
transferring the electromagnetic energy, which is generated in the vicinity of the SMBH,
and accelerating the bulk flow towards the speed of light via the conversion of the
Poynting to kinetic energy fluxes. Our results constitute the foundation of the MHD
paradigm of astrophysical jets.
