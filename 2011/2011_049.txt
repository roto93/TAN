Subject: Call for Proposals - ALMA Early Science Cycle 0

Dear Colleagues,

The ALMA Director is very pleased to issue this Call for Proposals for 
ALMA Early Science Cycle 0. An announcement of the call is attached. All 
the details are available at the newly-opened ALMA Science Portal at

http://www.almascience.org

which is jointly provided by the ALMA Regional Centers operated by the ALMA
Partners.

This marks a significant point in the history the ALMA project, which can 
trace its genesis to a meeting that took place in February 1983, just over 
28 years ago. We would like to acknowledge the contributions made by the 
many people from all over the world who have worked to develop and realize 
the ALMA dream, and those that continue to work towards its successful 
completion and operation.

With best wishes.
Thijs & Lewis
