*** Colloquium
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:	Prof. Sujan Sengupta (Indian Institute of Astrophysics)
Topic:		Cloudy Atmosphere of Brown Dwarfs : Theory vs. Observations
Time:		5/20 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:		ASMAB R1203
Abstract:
Brown dwarfs inhabits the realm intermediate to less massive
stars and giant planets. They are born like a star but fail to sustain
nuclear burning inside their core. Consequently they could not become a
star. The atmosphere of brown dwarfs are very much similar to hot giant
planets. Therefore, understanding the atmosphere of brown dwarfs provides
important insight onto the atmosphere of giant extra-solar planets.
Depending on their spectra, brown dwarfs are divided into two classes - L
and T dwarfs. The relatively hotter brown dwarfs belong to the subclass of
L dwarfs. Due to incomplete gravitational settling, the atmosphere of L
dwarfs should contain condensates mainly of silicate. The indirect
evidence for the presence of dust cloud in the atmosphere of L dwarfs
comes from the diagnosis of its optical and infra-red spectra. The direct
evidence of dust comes from the detection of linear polarization in the
optical bands. In the present talk, I shall discuss the physical
properties of the atmosphere of L brown dwarfs derived from the detail
theoretical analysis of the observed spectra as well as the observed
photo-polarimetric data.

Topic: Search for Neutron Electric Dipole Moment
Time: 5/24 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:10
Place: Room 104, CCM-New Physics Building

Abstract: The existence of neutron electric dipole moments (EDM) is a
signature of time-reversal violation, which implies CP violation under the
assumption of CPT invariance. Although CP-violation was first observed over
40 years ago, its physics origins remain unclear. While the Standard model
can describe CP-violation observed in the kaon and B-meson systems, it can
not account for the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe. An
observation of non-zero neutron EDM would provide a first direct evidence
for CP violation in the baryon sector. A new proposal to measure the neutro=
n
EDM using Ultra-cold neutrons (UCN) produced in superfluid helium is
discussed. The current status of this proposed experiment and the results
from some initial feasibility studies are presented.
