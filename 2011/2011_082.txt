*** Colloquium
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:	Prof. Albert Zijlstra (University of Manchester)
Topic:		Formation and evolution of planetary nebulae
Time:		5/27 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:		ASMAB R1203
Abstract:
Planetary nebulae reflect the death throes of Sun-like stars, when they eject
between 20% and 80% of their mass of the star through a 'super'-wind.  This
ejection process determines the white dwarf mass distribution, and is the
origin of up to half of the gas and dust in the ISM.  The cause, evolution and
composition of the superwind is still a matter of debate. Observations of
planetary nebulae and their progeny, AGB stars, provide important constraints
on the superwind and its origin. I will discuss new observational results,
including mass loss at low metallicity, the fate of iron, the formation
process of PAHs, and the formation and photo-evaporation of dust disks. I will
also discuss the effect of angular momentum which for much of stellar
evolution is in cold storage in the stellar system.

Dear Colleagues,

We are very pleased to invite you to the The 2011 Scientific Assembly of the
Astronomical Society of the Republic of China (ASROC2011) that will be held at
National Science and Technology Museum (NSTM) in Kaoshiung City on May 27--29
(Fri.--Sun.), 2011.  The final circular of ASROC2011 is now available at our
website in both englisn and chinese --

http://www.asroc.org.tw/asroc2011/download/ASROC2011-circular-3-chi.pdf

In the circular, you can find a summary of the ASROC2011 activities, links to
the Assembly program, lists of oral/poster presentations, and instruction to
the oral/poster contributors as well as participants.

We look forward to seeing you in Kaohsiung during the ASROC2011 weekend!

best regards,
