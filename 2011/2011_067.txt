Subject: ALMA Early Science Proposals -- Reminders

Dear Prospective Proposers,

Here are two reminders for you:

(1) A PI in Taiwan has access to ALMA through both East Asia (EA) and North
America (NA) regions. He/She can select which region the time should be
charged to. He/She can register with the ALMA Science Portal in both regions
using different User Names and E-mail addresses.

(2) Notice of Intent: To help ensure that the Cycle 0 review process is set
up in a way that allows proper handling of the set of proposals to be
assessed, and to assist the JAO to schedule the two configurations offered,
prospective Principle Investigators are strongly encouraged to submit a
notice of intent by April 29 using a simple web form on the science portal.

Thanks,
Chin-Fei
On behalf of Taiwan ARC Node
