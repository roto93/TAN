Subject: ASIAA/CCMS/IAMS/NTU-Physics Joint Colloquium, November 8

Dear Colleagues,

The NTU Physics Department, Center for Condensed Matter Science, Institute of
Atomic and Molecular Sciences, and the Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy
and Astrophysics invite everyone to our joint colloquium series. The speakers
are all famous international scholars and the colloquia are aiming at a broad
audience, including undergraduate students. Below is the information of the talk
on November 8(Tuesday). Please help to forward this to the colleagues in your
departments.

Best Regards,
Chih-Wei Chang (CCMS)
Jiunn-Wei Chen (NTU Physics)
Jer-Lai Kuo (IAMS)

_______________________________________________________ Speaker: Thomas Henning,
Max Planck Institute for Astronomy
Topic: Physics of Star Formation
Time: 11/8 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place: Room 104, CCM-New Physics Building

Abstract: Star formation is a fundamental process in the universe, shaping the
structure of our and other galaxies. The talk will summarize the general
principles of the star formation process. It will discuss global properties such
as the star formation efficiency and the initial mass function. In addition, it
will also demonstrate the power of adaptive optics in revealing the structure of
star-forming regions.

Brief Bio:Henning教授是以紅外線太空望遠鏡研究恆星與行星形成、原行星盤演化的世界級專家，????時也是透過實驗室瞭解宇宙中的塵粒的先驅。Henning教授是海德堡蒲朗克天文研究所所????，也是德國約拿大學教授。Henning教授是蒲朗克學會會士，為表彰Henning教授對天文的????獻，小行星30882即以Tomhenning為名。Henning教授將在本演講介紹與恆星形成有關的物????，歡迎大家踴躍參加。

Speaker: Leszek Roszkowski, University of Sheffield
Topic: Dark Matter
Time: 11/8 (Tuesday) 15:20 - 16:20
Place: Room 104, CCM-New Physics Building

Abstract: After reviewing evidence for the existence of the dark matter problem
in the Universe, I will list and discuss some most promising particle physics
candidates for its explanation. I will provide an update on prospects for the
detection of dark matter and discuss the role that the Large Hadron Collider may
play in elucidating its particle physics nature.

Brief Bio: Prof. Roszkowski received his Master’s degree from Warsaw University,
Poland in 1981, and his PhD degree from the University of California at Davis in
1987. After postdoctoral positions at Texas A&M, CERN, Michigan and Minnesota,
in 1996 he joined Lancaster University as a faculty member. In 2003 he was
appointed a Full Professor and the leader of the Astroparticle Physics and
Cosmology Group at the University of Sheffield. Since 2009 he has also been
employed at the National Centre for Nuclear Research in Warsaw, where he is
currently setting up a new particle theory group. Prof. Roszkowski has worked in
the areas of particle aspects of collider physics, astrophysics and early
Universe cosmology. His main areas of expertise are search for signatures of
physics beyond the Standard Model, especially supersymmetry and dark matter in
the Universe.
