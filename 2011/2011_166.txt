Dear Yi-Jehng, can you circulate the following IANCU Colloquium announcement? Thanks a lot.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear all, upcoming Colloquium at IANCU (S4-Room 1013) are:


Title: Strongly lensed high redshift galaxies identified in Herschel wide surveys.
Prospects for ALMA observations.
Speaker: Dr. Alian Omont (IAP)
Date: 2011-10-21
Time: 16:00-17:00
Abstract: The very few early known, strongly lensed high-z sub-mm sources (FIRAS10214,
Cloverleaf, APM08279), played a very important role in the development of high-z
submm/mm astronomy through pioneer detections of 0.85-1.2mm continuum and CO lines, and
various high sensitivity studies allowed by their strong magnification. Herschel wide
surveys, which will hopefully observe ~1000 deg?, are discovering hundreds of similarly
strongly lensed submm galaxies (e.g. Negrello et al. 2010). I will first review the
current state of mm/submm follow-up of such Herschel lensed galaxies with IRAM and other
facilities, for CO redshift determination, mapping mm continuum and CO lines with
interferometers, measuring 1.2mm continuum flux density, etc. I will specially stress
the case of the recent detection of H2O at IRAM/PdBI in two such sources at z=2.3 and
3.3 (Omont et al.2011). These examples give an idea of the numerous studies allowed by
strong lensing magnification and the enhanced capabilities of ALMA and IRAM/NOEMA, using
this unique sample of hundreds of Herschel high-z lensed galaxies.

Title: Nuclear Activity in Low Luminosity Spiral Galaxies
Speaker: Dr. Mousumi Das (Indian Institute of Astrophysics)
Date: 2011-11-01
Time: 14:00-15:00
Abstract: Low Luminosity spiral galaxies are generally dark matter dominated systems
that that have extended gas disks but show little star formation. They are thus poorly
evolved galaxies and do not show much nuclear activity. However, in our recent studies
of these galaxies we find that a significant fraction do have active galactic nuclei
(AGN) that are associated with low mass nuclear black holes. Most of these galaxies
either have large bulges or are in the process of forming a bulge. In some cases radio
lobes or jets are also seen with the AGN activity. This presentation will focus on
multi-frequency studies of this nuclear activity and its implications for studies of
galaxy evolution.

Title: The Mid-Infrared View of Galaxies: from Nearby Dwarfs to High-Redshift QSOs
Speaker: Dr. Chao-Wei Tsai (IPAC/Caltech)
Date: 2011-11-01
Time: 11:00-12:00
Abstract: The NASA Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) has mapped the entire sky
in 4 infrared bands centered at 3.4, 4.6, 12 and 22 microns, and has identified hundreds
of millions of IR sources. These bands are ideal for studying the extreme AGNs and
starburst galaxies. In the past one and half years, the WISE extragalactic science team
has discovered hyper luminous infrared galaxies (HyLIRGs), dust-obscured galaxies, red
AGNs, and very red blue compact dwarf galaxies (BCDs) with low metallicity. I will give
an overview of these results, and then focus on the projects of searching for HyLIRGs
and metal deficient BCDs, as well as on their multi-wavelength followup in details. At
the end, I will discuss the important impacts and applications of these discoveries to
our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution.

Title: PAndromeda - First Results from the High-cadence Monitoing of M31 with Pan-STARRS1
Speaker: Dr. Chien-Hsiu Lee (INACU)
Date: 2011-11-04
Time:14:00-15:00
Abstract: The Pan-STARRS 1 (PS1) survey of M31 (PAndromeda) is designed to identify
gravitational
microlensing events, caused by bulge and disk stars (self-lensing) and by compact matter
in the halos of M31 and the Milky Way (halo lensing, or lensing by MACHOs). With the 7
deg2 FOV of PS1, the entire disk of M31 can be imaged with one single pointing. Our aim
is to monitor M31 with this wide FOV with daily sampling (20 mins/day). In the 2010
season we acquired in total 91 nights towards M31, with 90 nights in the rP1 and 66
nights in the iP1. The total integration time in rP1 and iP1 are 70740s and 36180s,
respectively. As a preliminary analysis, we study a 40' X 40' sub-field in the central
region of M31, a 20' X 20' sub-field in the disk of M31 and a 20' X 20' sub-field for
the investigation of astrometric precision. We demonstrate that the PSF is good enough
to detect microlensing events. We present light curves for 6 candidate microlensing
events. This is a competitive rate compared to previous M31 microlensing surveys. We
finally also present one example light curve for Cepheids, novae and eclipsing binaries
in these sub-fields.
