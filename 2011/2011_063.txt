*** Colloquium
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:	Dr. Clive Dickinson (University of Manchester)
Topic:		Early Planck Results in the Galaxy
Time:		4/22 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:		ASMAB R1203
Abstract:
I will give an overview of the Planck mission and the recent Early Planck Results papers (submitted to A&A January 2011). I will present the results of the Galactic papers from these early papers, focussing on the Anomalous Microwave Emission (AME). Data from Planck, combined with ancillary data (WMAP, radio data, DIRBE etc.), has allowed us to construct precise spectra for Galactic regions such as Perseus and Rho Ophiuchus molecular clouds. The spectra show strong evidence for AME, which can be readily fitted by electric dipole radiation from small spinning dust grains.

Dear Colleagues,

The NTU Physics Department, NTU Center for Condensed Matter Science, and th=
e
Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics invite everyone to
our joint colloquium series. The speakers are all famous international
scholars and the colloquia are aiming at a broad audience, including
undergraduate students. Below is the information of the talk on April 26
(Tuesday). Please help to forward this to the colleagues in your
departments.

Best Regards,
Jiunn-Wei Chen (NTU Physics)
Chih-Wei Chang (NTU CCMS)
Wei-Hao Wang (ASIAA)

Speaker: Peter So (=C4=AC=A4l=A5=BF), MIT
 Topic: Probing Cellular and Tissue Biochemistry Based on Fluorescence
Spectroscopy & Imaging
Time: 4/26 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:10
Place: Room 104, CCM-New Physics Building

Abstract: Fluorescence and phosphorescence lifetime microscopy (FLIM/PLIM)
are a powerful techniques to quantify cellular biomedical environment such
as the concentration of metabolites. The combination of FLIM with
fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), a technique described as a
=A1=A7molecular ruler=A1=A8, further allows in vivo study of protein intera=
ctions. We
will demonstrate that the FLIM-FRET approach allows us to start deciphering
the protein interaction network governing important physiological processes
such as mechanotransduction. While 3D resolved FLIM and PLIM are informatio=
n
rich, they are slow imaging techniques. We will present temporal focusing
nonlinear microscopy as a solution that can improves FLIM-FRET data
acquisition speed by several orders of magnitude. We will demonstrate high
throughput FLIM imaging in resolving physiological structures in peripheral
nerve regeneration devices and PLIM imaging in quantifying tissue oxygen
partial pressure.
