Speaker:	Dr. Helmut Dannerbauer (CEA-Saclay)
Topic:		(Sub)millimeter observations of Distant, Massive Galaxies
Time:		4/15 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:		ASMAB R1203
Abstract:
In order to understand galaxy formation it is of primary importance to
obtain sensitive observations of the emission of dust, proportional to
the rate of star formation, and of gas, the primary ingredient of star
formation. Both are major goals of the Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). Interesting new science,
though, can be done now, while waiting for ALMA. Two major questions
in galaxy formation and assembly are: 1) do dusty starbursts exist at
very high-redshifts, and 2) what is the dominating mode of
star-formation in distant, massive galaxies, either galaxy mergers or
long-lasting cold gas accretion. To shed light on these topics, I will
present our on-going Herschel and IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer
observations of two important star-forming galaxy populations in the
distant universe: submillimeter selected galaxies (SMGs) and massive
disk galaxies at z=1.5. Finally, I will discuss the prospects of the
synergistic combination of ALMA and Herschel observations on these
high-redshift massive, star-forming galaxies.
