The 2011 Scientific Assembly of the Astronomical Society of the Republic of 
China (ASROC2011) will be held at National Science and Technology Museum 
(NSTM) in Kaohsiung on May 27 ?V 29 (Fri.-Sun.), 2011. This is the annual 
event for all astronomers and astrophysicists in Taiwan to report their most 
recent discoveries and research results, to exchange ideas, and also to 
incubate collaborations. Oral and poster presentations in all areas of 
astronomy and astrophysics are solicited. All of you are cordially invited to 
attend ASROC2011.
   We are delighted to announce that we will have the following two plenary 
talks: (1) ??Crystal Ball Gazing for this Decade: Transients (from PTF to 
LSST)??, given by Prof. Shri Kulkarni, Director of Caltech Optical 
Observatories, Caltech, and (2) ??Introducing ICRR ?V Cosmic Rays, Neutrinos 
and Gravitational Waves??, given by Prof. Takaaki Kajita, Director of 
Institute of Cosmic Ray Research (ICRR), University of Tokyo. In addition to 
contributed oral and poster presentations, there will be a special session of 
??Young Astronomer Meeting??, in which the future of and the interaction among 
young astronomers in Taiwan will be discussed. A popular science talk is being 
arranged and there are also exhibitions of astronomy books, telescopes, and 
instruments. Election of the society council members for 2011-2014 will be 
conducted during the meeting. The candidate list proposed by the current ASROC 
Executive Council can be found in the Society web site. 
   The ASROC2011 web site will be open from March 21, 2011 for on-line 
registration (deadline May 15) and abstract submission (deadline April 29). 
The final program will be announced on May 16. Contributions in the ASROC2011 
meeting, including oral talks and poster presentations, are invited to be 
published in the Journal of Taipei Astronomical Museum. For more information

Abstract: http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/activity/colloquium.php

*** Colloquium
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:	Dr. Dan Werthimer (UC Berkeley Space Science Lab)
Topic:		IS ANYBODY OUT THERE?    The Search for ET with help from Eight Million Volunteers
Time:		3/25 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:		ASMAB R1203
Abstract:
Werthimer will discuss the possibility of 
life in the universe and the search for radio and optical 
signals from other civilizations.  Berkeley's SETI@home 
project analyzes data from the world's largest radio telescope 
using desktop computers from millions of volunteers. 
SETI@home participants have contributed millions of years 
of computer time and have formed one of Earth's most powerful 
supercomputers.  Users have the small but captivating possibility 
their computer will detect the first signal from a civilization 
beyond Earth. 
       Werthimer will also discuss other citizen science projects, 
next generation radio telescopes,  as well as speculate on when 
Earthlings might discover other civilizations.

Speaker: Prof. Paul T. P. Ho (?P????) Academia Sinica
Topic: Origins of Everything:  Precision Astrophysics
Time: 3/29 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:10
Place: Room 104, CCM-New Physics Building

Abstract: With the modern advances in device physics, novel materials,
improved engineering, high speed computing, and space platforms,
astronomy has made enormous progress in the last two decades.
Precision astrophysics in the spatial domain, energy domain, and time
domain, has allowed us to study the "Origins of Everything", from life
to the formation of planets and stars, and from galaxies to the
beginning of the Universe.  In Taiwan, in this past decade, we are
engaging these frontiers of research.  We have access to the best
instruments in the world, and we are building some of them.  It is a
great time to be studying physics. In this talk, we will look at three
important problems: extrasolar systems, black holes, and cosmology.

Dear Yi-Jehng,

I posted the correction of CFHT deadline to TAN last week, but it does not seem to have been
clear enough for some users. I have just posted another one, so would you like to forward it
to the other TAN members asap?

In particular, it would be great if you describe the deadline as:
The deadline for CFHT proposals is Mar 25 8am (not March 23)

Xie xie nin, Hiro

Begin forwarded message:

Dear CFHT users,

I am sending the following correction once again:-

###################################################
  The deadline for CFHT proposals is Mar 25 8am (not March 23)
