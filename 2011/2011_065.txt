Dear All,

   This coming Friday afternoon, we will host an 1-hour event to promote our 
ALMA project (see the attached flyer). Recently, a Japanese rock band
named Acidman has released an album with a title of ALMA. Here is the link to 
that album,

This band is coming to Taipei this week and will visit us on this Friday, 
chatting with us about our ALMA science and their ALMA songs.

Venue: 1F Auditorium in the Astronomy-Mathematics Building, NTU
Time: April 22th, 1:00pm-2:00pm.

Please join and invite your colleagues and friends. Let's see what will come 
out when Science meets Music.
