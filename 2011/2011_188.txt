  TIARA Workshop on the Transient Universe
  December 12-16, 2011
  https://www.tiara.sinica.edu.tw/activities/workshop/20111212/

  TIARA, 8F General Building II, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu
##############################################################

The theme of this workshop is on the transient variability of cosmic
phenomena on both small and large scales, their observations, theories
and diagnostic probes. Topics include gamma ray bursts, tidal
disruption events, gamma ray and x-ray binaries, radio transients,
oscillations in black hole accretion disks, ultraluminous X-ray
sources, stellar mergers, and variability in extragalactic jet
sources.

To maximize the interactions between the speakers and local
astronomers we encourage participation from interested scientists from
local institutes and universities.

The emphasis of the workshop will be on discussions rather than formal
presentations. Hence, several talks are scheduled per day, with the
rest of the time devoted to informal discussions and working sessions.
