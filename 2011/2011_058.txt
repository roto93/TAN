*** Colloquium
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:	Roberto Galvan-Madrid (CfA/UNAM)
Topic:		On the Formation of the Most Massive Stars in the Galaxy
Time:		4/8 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:		ASMAB R1203
Abstract:
The 'really' massive stars (those with more than 10 to 20 solar masses) likely start to ionize their surroundings before they reach their final mass. How can they accrete in spite of the presence of over-pressurized gas? We present results of Submillimeter Array (SMA) and Very Large Array (VLA) studies of massive-star formation regions in the early stages of ionization: Molecular-line observations at resolutions from a few arcsec to 0.3 arcsec reveal the presence of rotation, infall, and/or outflow from parsec scales to <0.05 pc. Small groups of massive (proto)stars are found at different evolutionary stages. The innermost ionized gas is sometimes found to have organized motions, probably in the form of outflow and/or rotation. Multiepoch observations of the free-free continuum reveal significant flux variations in timescales of years, attributable to interactions with the surrounding molecular gas. These observations, as well as recent models and numerical simulations of HI!
 I region evolution in star-forming accretion flows, favor a picture in which: i) These very massive stars form in accretion flows that are partially ionized. ii) The cores from which these stars form keep accreting material from their enviroment (clump).

Dear Colleagues,

The NTU Physics Department, NTU Center for Condensed Matter Science, and the
Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics invite everyone to
our joint colloquium series. The speakers are all famous international
scholars and the colloquia are aiming at a broad audience, including
undergraduate students. Below is the information of the talk on April 12
(Tuesday). Please help to forward this to the colleagues in your
departments.

Best Regards,
Jiunn-Wei Chen (NTU Physics)

 Topic: Pure Spin Currents: Discharging Spintronics (Joint colloquium and
IEEE Distinguished Lecture)
Time: 4/12 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:10
Place: Room 104, CCM-New Physics Building

Abstract: As semiconducting electronic devices are miniaturized to
ever-smaller dimensions, power dissipation becomes an ever-increasing
problem due to leakage charge currents. Spintronics may help addressing some
of these issues by utilizing besides the charge degree of freedom also the
electron spin. Conventional spintronics approaches are used for non-volatile
devices, such as magnetic random access memory, where spin currents are
mainly considered as spin-polarized charge currents and as a result the spin
and charge currents are in parallel and directly coupled. Looking further
into the future, the question arises, whether eliminating charge currents
altogether could provide additional benefits for applications. Towards
addressing this question, non-local device geometries allow for separating
spin and charge currents, which in turn enables the investigation and use of
pure spin currents. This approach opens up new opportunities to study
spin-dependent physics and gives rise to novel approaches for generating and
controlling angular momentum flow.
This lecture will discuss different approaches for generating pure spin
currents, such as non-local electrical injection from a ferromagnet,
charge-to-spin current conversion via spin Hall effects, and spin pumping
from ferromagnetic resonance. Furthermore, examples will be shown for how
spin currents can be used for gaining new insights into spin dependent
phenomena. In particular, the temperature dependence of spin and charge
relaxation times allows to identify different spin relaxation mechanisms. In
addition, spin pumping facilitates the generation of macroscopically large
pure spin currents. This permits to quantify spin Hall effects with great
precision, even in materials where these effects are relatively weak.
Finally, the lecture will conclude with a brief outlook on the current
scientific and future technological opportunities for pure spin currents.

Brief Bio: Dr. Hoffmann's research interests encompass a wide variety of
magnetism related subjects, including basic properties of magnetic
heterostructures, spin-transport in novel geometries, and biomedical
applications of magnetism. He has more than 100 publications, four book
chapters, and three magnetism-related U.S. patents. He is an associate
editor for the Journal of Applied Physics, a senior IEEE member and a member
of the Advisory Committee for the IEEE Magnetics Society.
