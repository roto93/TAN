*** Colloquium
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:	Prof. Rachel Webster (University of Melbourne)
Topic:		The Epoch of Reionisation: the MWA Experiment
Time:		3/11 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:		ASMAB R1203
Abstract:
The birth of the first stars and black holes is currently unobservable, buried in a sea of neutral Hydrogen in a time we currently call the ???Dark Ages???.  Detailed numerical simulations predict the sequence of events which may have unfolded, but we do not yet know when the first sources turned on, nor what their characteristics were.  There are two wavebands which appear to be promising for the first observations: the infrared and long radio wavelengths.  This talk will describe the expected radio signatures  of redshifted 21cm emission from Hydrogen, and the new telescopes which are attempting to detect these signals. In addition, a description will be given of some of the potential science which will be accessible once the web of 21cm emission is observed.
