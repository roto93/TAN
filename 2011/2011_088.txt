Lulin One-meter Telescope (LOT) =97 Call for Observing Proposals for 2011B

Proposal Deadline =97 23:59 June 30, Thursday, 2011

The Lulin One-meter Telescope (LOT) solicits observing proposals for the
semester of 2011B.  The new semester begins on August 1st, 2011 and ends
on January 31st ,2012.

Those interested in applying for observing time can download the
proposal LaTex package from the web page:

  http://www.astro.ncu.edu.tw/~wchen/lulinprop/lotprop.zip

The completed proposal should contain the filled, compiled version of the
LaTex file, plus up to two more pages of figures, tables, and references,
as a single PDF file, and be submitted to the following email address:

  tac_lulin@astro.ncu.edu.tw

with a copy to me to avoid occasional erroneous delivery:

  wchen@astro.ncu.edu.tw

In addition to research proposals, we will also consider educational
projects for
advanced astronomical observation courses.  Time allocation will be
announced by
mid-July, 2011.

There are two instruments available, the Lulin CCD Imager (LCI) and the
Lulin
Compact Spectrograph (LCS).   In 2011B an optical tri-color simultaneous
imaging polarimeter
may become online on a share-risk basis.  Those who would like to know more
about
the polarimeter should contact me.   You can follow this url to get
information regarding
the telescope and instruments,
