Subject: Re: The Second APCosPA Winter School/workshop

Dear Colleagues:

     It might be a good reminder. Our Winter School will have more than 20 
foreign "students" (graduate students and young postdocs) from mainland 
China (9), S. Korea (9), Japan (2+), and Australia (2). This is on top of 
the "domestic" "students" - which was limited to about 30. Again, we will 
have the "competitions" - last year, no. 1 to a student from Japan, no. 2 
from Beida, and no. 3 from New Zealand. This competition substantially 
upgraded the level of the school; students made their choice of whether to 
join the competition. The finalists would be excellent candidates for 
future employments. Thus, I urge you to encourage the outstanding students 
to attend the School/Workshop and the competitions.

     The web side is www.cospa.ntu.tw/2011winterschool. The deadline will 
be slightly postponed to a few dates after this message.            
     Sincerely yours, W-Y. Pauchy Hwang
