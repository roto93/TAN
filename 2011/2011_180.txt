IANCU Colloquium

Title: EPOXI mission and ground-based observations of comet 103P/Hartley 2
Speaker: Dr. Lin Zhong-Yi (INACU)
Date: 2011-11-11
Time: 14:00-15:00
Location: NCU S4-1013

Abstract:

Ground-based observations provide synergistic information for space mission encounters
by providing data over longer timescales, at different wavelengths and using techniques
that are impossible with an in situ flyby. Here, we will summarize the results of EPOXI
mission and report our observations in support of the EPOXI spacecraft flyby of comet
103P/Hartley 2.
