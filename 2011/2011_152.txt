Subject: Call to Organisations for Participation 

Dear IAU Members, 

Very many thanks to those who replied to our call for volunteers interested in contributing to "Astronomy for a Better World." The reaction has been very encouraging. 

This is to draw your attention to the opportunity for organisations, institutes and astronomy departments to contribute to future IAU "Astronomy for Development" activities and the OAD workshop to discuss this in Cape Town from 12 - 14 December. See: http://iau.org/static/education/oad/message_to_organisations_sep2011.pdf   

We would be grateful if you would bring this to the attention of your organisation. 

Thanks again for your help.
