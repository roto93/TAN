                                 EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR

                             CANADA-FRANCE-HAWAII TELESCOPE

                                                                October 19, 2011

The Board of Directors of the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Corporation is pleased to announce the appointment of Dr. Douglas Simons as Executive Director of the Corporation, beginning May 1, 2012.  Dr. Simons is currently Senior Scientist at the Gemini Observatory and served as Gemini Director until May 1 of this year.  Along with his extensive management experience at Gemini, Dr. Simons brings to CFHT exceptional skills in  astronomical instrumentation and in forging collaborative partnerships among observatories.   For Dr. Simons, this is a return to familiar territory.  He received his Ph.D. from the University of Hawaii in 1990, based on work done at CFHT, and subsequently spent 4 years there as Resident Astronomer, before joining Gemini.

Dr. Simons will be the ninth CFHT Executive Director, and will follow Dr. Christian Veillet, who has held the position since May 2003. The appointment of Dr. Simons was the result of an unrestricted search and  signals a new era for the Corporation.  Previous Executive Directors were employed through the Corporation's member agencies in Canada or France, whereas  Dr. Simons will be employed directly by the CFHT Corporation. The Board looks forward to working with  Dr. Simons to secure the future of CFHT among the foremost observatories in the world.
