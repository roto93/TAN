Speaker: Oliver Gutfleisch, IFW Dresden
Topic: Magnetic Materials in Sustainable Energy
Time: 5/3 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:10
Place: Room 104, CCM-New Physics Building

Abstract: A new energy paradigm, consisting of greater reliance on renewabl=
e
energy sources and increased concern for energy efficiency in the total
energy lifecycle, has accelerated research in energy-related technologies.
Due to their ubiquity, magnetic materials play an important role in
improving the efficiency and performance of devices in electric power
generation, conversion and transportation. Magnetic materials are essential
components of energy applications (i.e. motors, generators, transformers,
actuators, etc.) and improvements in magnetic materials will have
significant impact in this area, on par with many =93hot=94 energy material=
s
efforts (e.g. hydrogen storage, batteries, thermoelectrics, etc.).
The lecture focuses on the state-of-the-art hard and soft magnets and
magnetocaloric materials with an emphasis on their optimization for energy
applications. Specifically, the impact of hard magnets on electric motor an=
d
transportation technologies, of soft magnetic materials on electricity
generation and conversion technologies, and of magnetocaloric materials for
refrigeration technologies, will be discussed.
The synthesis, characterization, and property evaluation of the materials,
with an emphasis on structure-property relationships, will be examined in
the context of their respective markets as well as their potential impact o=
n
energy efficiency.
Finally, considering future bottle-necks in raw materials and in the supply
chain, options for recycling of rare-earth metals will be analysed.

Brief Bio: Dr. Gutfleisch is a research fellow and the "Functional Magnetic
Materials and Hydrides" group leader at IFW Dresden. He is also a visiting
professor of the Imperial College London, and a visiting advisor of NIMS
Tsukuba. He has 180 publications in refereed journals in high performance
permanent magnets for E-mobility and energy applications, magnetocaloric
materials and magnetic cooling, ferromagnetic shape memory alloys, and soli=
d
state hydrogen storage.

Speaker:	Prof. Xander Tielens (Leiden Observatory)
Topic:		Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon molecules in Space
Time:		5/6 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:		ASMAB R1203
Abstract:
Strong IR emission features at 3.3, 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, and 11.2 ??m are a common characteristic of regions of massive star formation in the Milky Way and nearby galaxies and out to redshifts of ~3. These features are carried by large (??? 50 C-atom) Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon molecules, which are pumped by the strong FUV photon flux from these stars. ISO/SWS and Spitzer/IRS studies have revealed the richness of the interstellar IR emission spectrum and the variations therein. These variations reflect variations in the physical conditions of the emitting regions.

Over the last 10-20 years, extensive experimental and theoretical studies have elucidated the intrinsic infrared properties of large PAH molecules and their dependence on the molecular characteristics. We are now reaching a stage where we can use the observations of the IR emission spectrum as diagnostic tools to determine the physical conditions in the emitting regions of particular regions of star formation.

Observations have shown that PAH molecules are abundant and ubiquitous in the interstellar medium. Conversely, PAHs may also be a dominant ???force??? in the interstellar medium. In particular, PAHs dominate the photoelectric heating of interstellar gas and thereby shape the phase (cloud/intercloud) structure of the ISM. PAHs are also the dominant negative charge carriers inside dense molecular cloud cores and, hence, regulate the charge balance of molecular gas. Thus, PAHs control the ambipolar diffusion process and the onset of gravitational collapse.

Because the IR emission features dominate the IR spectrum of regions of massive star formation, these bands are often used as proxies to determine the importance of star formation on galactic scales. Specifically, the importance of star formation versus AGN activity for the luminosity source of ULIRGs is based upon a quantitative interpretation of the observed PAH emission from galactic nuclei.
I will review these different aspects of interstellar IR spectra, the extensive laboratory studies on the spectroscopic and chemical properties of PAHs, their relationship to the intrinsic properties of PAHs, the role of these PAHs in shaping the universe around us ??? in particular through the star formation process ??? and the use of PAH emission spectra as quantitative indicators of star formation.

Dear Prof. Kuan,

Would you please announce the info of the CPS school via TAN?
I was a postdoc at ASIAA before and this is the second circular of
CPS 8th planetary school.  The first circular was forwarded by Naomi.

Thank you in advance,

Takayuki Tanigawa
Center for Planetary Science / ILTS, Hokkaido University

Second Circular - REGISTRATION IS NOW OPEN-

---A Message from the Seminar/School Chair, Prof. Hiroshi Shibai---
The disaster caused by the huge earthquake and tsunami of 11 March is now
being overcome with extraordinary efforts by Japanese people as well as
through international cooperation initiated by many countries. The problem of
the six nuclear reactors is being addressed, though not quickly but through a
step-by-step approach. The reactors are cooled with plenty of water in order
to restrain nuclear reactions. The emanation of radioactive materials is still a
severe problem. The Japanese government and the owner of the crippled
nuclear power plants, the Tokyo Electric Power Company, are devoting their
efforts to stop these leaks.

Fortunately, our Seminar/School has not been affected at all by these
problems. The conference place in Awaji Island and KAMIOKANDE as well as
Osaka University and CPS are located in the western part of Japan, while the
nuclear reactors hit by the earthquake and tsunami are located in the
north-eastern part. The distance between the conference location and the
nuclear reactors is approximately 800 km, which is too great to be affected by
radioactive material. The electric power of our area has remained stable, since
we have a different electrical system in the western part of Japan. Therefore,
we have had neither damage nor other adverse effects due to this disaster.

Given these circumstances, we hope that many foreign and Japanese
participants will come to join this seminar/school with no apprehension. If we
do have any changes in the environment that may affect the program, then we
will inform all of you immediately.

OBJECTIVE AND SCOPE:
The objective of the school/seminar is to promote education and research in
planetary sciences for highly motivated graduate students and young
researchers by providing them with an opportunity to interact with leading
scientists in a specific field. Note that the term ???Planetary
Sciences??? is used in
a broader sense to include astronomy, astrophysics, astrochemistry,
astrobiology, astromineralogy, geosciences, space science, cosmology, and
other related fields.
The eighth school is jointly held with the Asian Academic Seminar hosted by
JSPS, Japan, and DST, India, for providing Asian young researchers with
intensive training in areas of Astronomy and Space Science. The seminars
comprise lectures by experts in the subject fields, discussions,
practical training,
study visits and other components.

Topic of the coming school:
Challenges in Astronomy: Observational Advances

The main part of the school will be a series of lectures on 'Recent and Future
Advances in Observational Astronomy.' The observational part of astronomy
has revealed various, important phenomena in the Universe collaborating with
theoretical works, and advancing fronts in well-established parts, e.g.,
optical-infrared, radio, high-energy radiations. Furthermore, the gravitational
wave is expected to be detected in near future, and the advancement of ???virtual
observatory??? would enable astronomers to conduct multi-wavelength
data-incentive research, as the 4th paradigm in astronomy. Young astronomers
are expected to learn about world-wide trend for constructing a wider and
concrete base of their own research.

          Room 1203, Astronomy-Mathematics Building

http://events.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/workshop/20110521/index.php

            Registration Deadline: May 7, 2011
----------------------------------------------------------------
Announcement:

The Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics at Academia Sinica (ASIAA)
announces its third workshop for Taiwanese ALMA users. The workshop is
oriented for all astronomers, regardless of specialty.

The first call for proposals has been issued on March 30, 2011 for the ALMA
Early Science (ES). This ALMA workshop is designed to provide information on
the ES capabilities, ARC user support, Proposal Review Process, and to help
users in preparing and submitting their proposals with the ALMA tools. There
will be an open Q&A session for users to consult our ARC members with their
questions. Also, there will be a proposal assessment session, in which users
will present their proposals with scientific and technical justifications,
each for about 20-30 mins, for the assessment. Users are encouraged to sign
up for this session for sharpening their proposals! Additional workshops
will be organized later to help users to prepare their observing programs
(i.e., scheduling blocks) and to reduce their data.


The organizing committee encourages all the Taiwanese astronomers and
scholars interested in observing with ALMA to take part in this workshop.
Students coming from outside Taipei City/County can apply for travel support
from ASIAA for the transportation and accommodation, and this support is
sponsored by tuCASA. Due to limited space and the hands-on nature of this
workshop, participation will be limited to 50 people.

Action items before coming to the workshop:

    1. browse through all the presentation files in our 2nd ALMA user workshop
    2. read through the ALMA ES Primer and the Science Web pages
    3. work through a OT example and a SIMDATA example
    4. register in the ALMA Science Portal and browse the helpdesk
    5. have their own favorite proposals ready for technical assessment
