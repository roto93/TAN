*** Colloquium
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:	Prof. Michael Strauss (Princeton University)
Topic:		Clustering of Quasars on Small and Large Scales
Time:		3/4 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:		ASMAB R1203
Abstract:
The clustering of quasars is an important clue to the nature of the
dark matter halos in which they sit, and the types of galaxies that
host them.  I will present results on the clustering of quasars as a
function of redshift, which demonstrate that they tend to occupy dark
matter halos of order several x 10^12 solar masses at all redshift.
On scales of less than 1 Megaparsec, binary quasars give clues to the
mechanism by which material is fed to the central black hole, and can
test models by which galaxy mergers trigger quasar activity.  I will
describe methods for identifying binary quasars from imaging and
spectroscopic data, and conclude with a look to the next generation of
imaging and spectroscopic surveys to find more such objects.
