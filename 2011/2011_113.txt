First Announcement for Symposium on Cosmology and Particle Astrophysics 2011 (CosPA2011)

There have been many achievements in the area of Cosmology and Particle Astrophysics (CosPA) in the past few years. For researchers dedicated to Cosmology and Particle Astrophysics from the Asia-Pacific region, the Symposium on Cosmology and Particle Astrophysics (CosPA Symposium) provides a platform and opportunity to discuss new issues, exchange new ideas and learn about new techniques from both theoretical and experimental aspects. Starting from 2002, CosPA Symposiums have been successfully held in Taiwan, Korea, Australia, and Japan for seven times, during which improvements of communication and collaboration among researchers are achieved. Right now, CosPA Symposium has grown into a meeting with wide international influence.

CosPA2011 will be held in the campus of Peking University, Beijing, Mainland China, during October 28-31, 2011. The symposium will cover issues in many frontiers of Cosmology and Particle Astrophysics. CosPA2011 is now open to registration for participants.
