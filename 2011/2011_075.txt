===========================
First Announcement of the 2nd Fermi Asian Network (FAN) Workshop
http://crab0.astr.nthu.edu.tw/FAN2/
===========================
August 1-5, 2011
International Conference Hall, National Tsing Hua University

We are delighted to announce the 2nd Fermi Asian Network (FAN)
workshop. The FAN collaboration consists of high-energy
astrophysicists mainly from Taiwan, Hong Kong and Korea, and we are
aiming to answer some of the major astrophysical problems by using
Fermi data. Over the last year, we have published a series of papers
with a focus on compact objects. In order to review our effort and
expand our collaboration, we will hold the 2nd workshop in Taiwan. The
theme of this workshop will be on compact objects and their
environment. We would like to address pressing problems in the general
context related to compact objects. The core topics of the workshop
will cover

* Millisecond pulsars
* Gamma-ray binaries
* AGN
* Fermi transients
* Unidentified Fermi objects
* Supernova remnants and pulsar wind nebulae

The emphasis of this workshop will be on both discussions and formal
presentations. We will also hold a mini hand-on training course to
help students and postdoc to analyze Fermi data.

However, such format can not accommodate a large group. Thus the total
number of participants will be limited to about 30.

Invited Speakers:

Lucas Guillemot (MPIfR)
Jun Kataoka (Waseda)
Roger Romani (Stanford)
Bronek Rudak (Torun)

Registration:
There is no registration fee and everyone is invited to participate in
this workshop. We will provide accommodation support (on sharing
basis) for overseas and non-NTHU students. You are encouraged to make
a contributed talk related to the workshop. The workshop will provide
lunches, tea/coffee breaks, and a conference dinner (August 3). The
registration deadline is on June 30, 2011. Due to the limited space,
priority will be given to those with contributed talks. Please visit
http://crab0.astr.nthu.edu.tw/FAN2/ for registration.

Accommodation:
Block-booked accommodation is provided in the guest house of NTHU or a
nearby hotel. The rate is about NTD1800 per night including breakfast.
If you are a student (overseas or non-NTHU), we will provide financial
support (on sharing room basis) for the nights from July 31 to August
5. Please indicate if you need financial support and whether you want
to share room with other student.

this workshop.

The workshop is sponsored by the National Science Council and National
Tsing Hua University
