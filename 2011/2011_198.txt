Abstract: http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/activity/colloquium.php

*** Colloquium
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Prof. Tetsuya Nagata (Kyoto University)
Topic:        Cepheid variables and star formation in the Galactic center from IRSF observations at SAAO
Time:        11/25 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
I will present near-infrared observations of the Galactic center region
with our Infrared Survey Facility (IRSF) 1.4-m telescope at South
African Astronomical Observatory.  From the observations, we recently
found three classical Cepheids in the nuclear bulge with pulsation
periods of approximately 20 days, within 40 parsecs (projected distance)
of the super massive black hole at the Galactic center.  No Cepheids
with longer or shorter periods were found.  We infer that there was a
period about 25 Myr ago, and possibly lasting until recently, in which
star formation increased relative to the period of 30-70 Myr ago.  The
timescale of such episodic star formation might be comparable with that
of the cyclic gas accumulation predicted for the central part of the
Milky Way.

Dear all, below is the upcoming colloquium at IANCU:


Title: Supenovae as Sources of Interstellar Dust
Speaker: Dr. Takaya Nozawa (IPMU)
Date: 2011-11-29
Time: 15:00-16:00
Location: National Central University, S4-1013

Abstract:
Supernovae (SNe) have been believed to be important producers of interstellar dust. I
present the overview of a series of our works on the calculations of dust formation in
the SN ejecta and dust destruction by the reverse shocks in the SN remnants (SNRs). I
show that the mass of dust injected from SNe into the interstellar medium heavily depend
on the types of SNe and that envelope-stripped SNe such as Type IIb/Ib/Ia are unlikely
to be dominant sources of dust. I also mention the difference in estimate of dust mass
formed in SNe between theory and observation, showing that this difference is getting
resolved by the recent far-infrared observations of nearby SNe and SNRs.

Dear all, below is the information for upcoming colloquium at IANCU;


Title: Formation and evolution of most massive galaxies in the Universe
Speaker: Dr. Yen-Ting Lin (ASIAA)
Date: 2011-12-02
Time: 14:00-15:00
Location: National Central University, S4-1013

Abstract:
Brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) are a special class of galaxies. Being the most
massive galaxies in the Universe, their formation and evolution path have been an
important topic in galaxy formation and cosmology. I will review the current paradigm of
the BCG formation, and present a couple of new attempts to shed light on the importance
of mergers on their assembly history.
