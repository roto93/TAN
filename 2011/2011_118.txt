*** Colloquium
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:	Dr. Jian-Rong Gao (Delft University of Technology)
Topic:		Detectors from Herschel to SPICA space telescope (** NOTE special time **)
Time:		8/10 (Wednesday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:		ASMAB R1203
Abstract:
Astronomers know that the electromagnetic spectrum in the infrared region contains huge amount of useful information over our Universal. To discover the origins of galaxies, stars and planets, the Herschel Space Observatory (HSO) has been successfully built and launched in 2009 by the European Space Agency (ESA), where one of the instruments is HIFI (Heterodyne Instrument for the Far Infrared). Although HSO is busy with its science results, the next generation of infrared telescope, SPICA, to be jointly developed by the Japanese space agency (JAXA) and ESA, has been down-selected.  SRON as the PI institute will contribute an imaging spectrometer to SPICA, which is called SAFARI and covers a wavelength range of 30???200 ??m. The instrument with an unprecedented sensitivity and array size will help astronomers to watch distant stars and planets being born, revealing more about how the universe came to be. In this talk I will report the challenges and progresses in the developm!
 ent of the detection technology.
