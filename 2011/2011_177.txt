*** Colloquium

Speaker:	Dr. Mike Cai (UCSD)
Topic:		Fight Against Climate Change ??? making artificial coal
Time:		11/4 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:		 R1203
Abstract:
I will review the recent developments on the torrefaction project.  By using a revolutionary technology, we are able to reduce the coal making process from millions of years under natural conditions down to mere minutes.  This technology allows artificial coal production to be competitive with mining natural coal in a free market without any subsidies.  If the coal-fired power plants were to use artificial coal as their fuel, their operation would become carbon neutral or even negative, which is a tremendous weapon in the arsenal to fight against climate change.
