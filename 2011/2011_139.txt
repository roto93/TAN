Topic: The Quest for the First Galaxies
Time: 9/13 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:10
Place: Room 104, CCM-New Physics Building

Abstract: A few hundred million years after the Big Bang, the hydrogen in
deep space was ionized into its component protons and electrons. Theorists
speculate this landmark event was caused by the birth of the first galaxies=
