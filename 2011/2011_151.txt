Topic:		Dust production in Planetary Nebulae
Time:		9/30 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:		 R1203
Abstract:
Planetary Nebulae (PNe) represent a final stage in the evolution of
low- to intermediate-mass stars with initially 1-8  solar mass; at the
end of its life,
a star of such mass evolves first into a red giant branch star, then
an asymptotic giant branch star, and a PN. Dust production in the
Milky Way galaxy predominantly comes from mass-loss during these end
stages of stellar evolution. However, our understanding of dust
creation and evolution largely comes from stars with metallicity close
to the solar value. As sensitive observations of
dust at lower metallicity are made in distant galaxies, it is
imperative that we understand and characterize dust production at low
metallicity within our own
galactic environment. LMC PNe are ideal targets to study dust
production and (dust) mass-loss rate in low- to intermediate-mass
stars. Since the distance to
the LMC is well determined and they evolved from stars with different
metallicity, composition, and initial mass, we can estimate dust mass
with less uncertainly and we can discuss relations between dust mass
and properties of an ionized nebula and the progenitor star.  I have
been estimating dust mass in LMC PNe based on the data taken by
Spitzer legacy projects SAGE and SAGE-Spec. I will show results of LMC
PN dust and introduce ongoing other projects on dust in PNe.
