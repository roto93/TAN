Subject: IAU Global OAD_Call for Volunteers

Please distribute this to relevant people within your institute, including scientific staff, engineers, postdocs and students. Also feel free to forward it to astronomy popularisers, amateur astronomers and teachers who you regard as having the background and expertise needed to participate usefully.

Dear IAU Members and others interested in contributing to ¡§Astronomy for a Better World¡¨. 

This is to draw your attention to the message from the IAU Office of Astronomy for Development (OAD) in the latest IAU Information Bulletin. 

The OAD is compiling list of potential volunteers willing to contribute to the IAU capacity building activities described in the IAU Strategic Plan. Astronomy for the Developing World 2010 ¡V 2020: Building from IYA 2009.  http://iau.org/static/education/strategicplan_091001.pdf 

It aims to use astronomy as a tool to stimulate development at all levels including primary, secondary and tertiary education, science research and the public understanding of science. 

Present and planned activities include: 
¡E     Building Research Capacity and university education 
   # Schools for university students 
   # Long-term visits to institutes in developing countries 
   # Long-term institute twinning 
   # Inspirational lectures to students on astronomy and related technologies. 
¡E     Astronomy for Schools 
   # Teacher training courses 
   # Development and translation of educational material for children. 
¡E     Astronomy for the Public 
   # Inspirational semi-popular lectures on astronomy or related technologies 
   # Activities building on IYA2009 including stargazing and engagement with amateur groups 

In addition to participation in the delivery or helping with the organization of activities there are several general areas in which volunteer assistance would be valuable, e.g. translation of the OAD website into several languages. 

We are particularly interested in contacting expatriates who are prepared to help carry out development activities in their countries of origin. 
Note that the strategic plan spans a ten-year period. Assessing the number of potential volunteers, will help us gauge the scale of possible activities, develop an effective organizational structure to run them and provide information for fund raising campaigns. We shall gradually increase the number of volunteers and expand the programmes in line with funding possibilities. 

We would therefore be grateful if you would complete the questionnaire for potential volunteers at http://www.astronomyfordevelopment.org/index.php/volunteers.You can also reach us at info@astro4dev.org specifying as subject: ¡§Call for Volunteers¡¨ or contact us personally. 

Very many thanks for your help.

The IAU Global Office of Astronomy for Development (OAD) 

The IAU, in partnership with the South African National Research Foundation, recently established the Office of Astronomy for Development (OAD) at the SAAO in Cape Town, South Africa. The creation of the OAD is a significant milestone towards realising the decadal strategic plan "Astronomy for the Developing World, Building from the IYA2009". 

The vision for the OAD is simply expressed by its slogan ¡§Astronomy for a better world." It aims to use astronomy as a tool to stimulate development at all levels including primary, secondary and tertiary education, science research and the public understanding of science.   

The OAD currently has two staff members and the search is underway for the third. We have issued a call for expressions of interest for institutions to host regional nodes, as well as a call for potential volunteers. Besides creating regional nodes, the OAD aims to set up three task forces to focus on (i) university education and research; (ii) young children and school education; and (iii) public outreach. In December 2011 a workshop will be held at the OAD for major stakeholders. The OAD will present its activities and an account of its progress at the IAU General Assembly in August 2012
