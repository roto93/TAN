Subject: reminde: SMA proposal deadline

Reminder: ASIAA Call for SMA proposals for 2011A

Dear Colleagues,

This is a kind reminder that:

The deadline for proposal submission for the ASIAA SMA time
for the 2011A semester is 2011 March 18 (Friday), 4AM in the
morning (Taiwan time).  [The deadline corresponds to March 17
(Thursday) 10AM in Hawaii, USA, and 4PM EST in Cambridge, USA.]

All Taiwanese SMA proposals must be submitted through the SMA
submission facility (http://sma1.sma.hawaii.edu/proposing.html).
New proposers in particular need to get registered (through
the submission web site) before submitting a proposal.
Taiwanese proposers should select "ASIAA" as their destination
TAC in the submission web page.  Please direct your inquiries
(in particular PI eligibility) to TATSUHIKO HASEGAWA
(hasegawa AT asiaa.sinica.edu.tw).

For technical information on the SMA, please visit
       http://sma1.sma.hawaii.edu/proposing.html   .
The SAO SMA information page will be updated for 2011A.
For Taiwan and ASIAA specific aspects (including the PI
eligibility, the ASIAA proposal selection process, and the
amount of available observing time), please visit
       http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/~SMART/  .

A few cautions about proposal format and writing merit reiterating.
- In addition to the page limit, there are limits to the font size
      (11 point or larger) and layout (two pages for text only and two
      pages for figures, tables, and references).
- A request for a good weather without a compelling reason tends to
      get a lower rating from reviewers.


Sincerely,

Tatsuhiko Hasegawa
on behalf of ASIAA SMA TAC
