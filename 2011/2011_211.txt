Speaker: Tamiaki Yoneya, University of Tokyo
 Topic: What is String Theory?
Time: 12/20 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:10
Place: Room 104, CCM-New Physics Building

Abstract: String theory has a long history since its birth in the end of
the 1960th. However, we are still in the midst of the process of exploring
true meanings and new outcomes of string theory. In this talk, I would like
to review the development of string theory towards an ultimate unification
of all fundamental interactions including gravity. In particular, special
emphasis is put on the importance of string theory as a possible framework
in which the long standing conflict between quantum theory and general
relativity may be resolved.

Brief Bio: Prof. Tamiaki Yoneya got his PhD at Hokaido University in 1974,
and became a professor at Tokyo University since 1980. He is now an
Emeritus Professor at Tokyo University, and a professor at the Open
University of Japan.
Prof. Yoneya is a pioneer of string theory. He was one of the first persons
who realized that string theory is a theory of quantum gravity. He won the
first Nishinomya-Yukawa Memorial Award in 1986. He also won JPS Award for
Academic Papers in 2007 for his works on the space-time uncertainty
principle.
