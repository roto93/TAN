*** Colloquium
____________________________________________________
Speaker:       Prof. Shude Mao (NAOC/University of Manchester)
Topic:           Strong gravitational lensing by galaxies"
Time:           11/18 (Friday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
I will review the basic concepts of strong gravitational lensing by galaxies. I
will mainly focus on the current status of its applications on substructures
within the lens galaxies and those along the line of sight. I will also briefly
mention some other potential applications including the discovery of multiple
black holes using gravitational lensing and finish with a brief look into the
future.


*** Special Seminar
____________________________________________________
Speaker:        Dr. Jason Rhode (NASA JPL)
Topic:          WFIRST and Euclid
Time:           11/16 (Wednesday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
The past decade has seen tremendous progress in astronomy that has brought us to
the brink of being able to answer two very fundamental questions:
What is the Universe made of?
Are we alone?
The first question can only be answered by trying to understand the mysterious
“dark energy” causing the accelerated expansion of the Universe.  This dark
energy, the dominant constituent of the Universe, has a number of possible
theoretical explanations, ranging from a cosmological constant, to possible
modifications to Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity. The second question is
motivated by the increasing frequency of detections of exoplanets and can be
explored by seeking out the frequency of Earth-like planets in the habitable
zone of stars similar to the sun.   Both of these science goals can be best
explored with a space-based wide-field telescope capable of imaging and
spectroscopy.  Such a platform, operating in optical to near infrared
wavelengths would also make great strides in a myriad of ancillary astrophysical
areas, including the evolution of galaxies and structures over two thirds of the
age of the Universe. The European Space Agency is in the final!
 stages of examining the Euclid mission, which is optimized to study dark matter
and dark energy.  NASA has begun planning for the Wide Field Infrared Survey
Telescope designed to explore dark energy and perform an exoplanet survey.  I’ll
discuss the scientific motivations of both missions and give an overview of the
hardware, observing strategy and status of each mission.
