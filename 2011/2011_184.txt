Speaker:	Prof. Thomas Henning (MPIA)
Topic:		TBA [* NOTE special time *] The Earliest Stages of Massive Star Formation From Spitzer to Herschel
Time:		11/10 (Thursday) 14:00 - 15:00
Place:		 R1203
Abstract:
The talk will discuss progress in our understanding of the earliest stages of massive star formation . The ISO and Spitzer infrared space missions revealed a new class of astronomical objects, the Infrared Dark Clouds (IRDCs). These very cold and dense molecular clouds are potential sites of massive star formation. Their properties will be discussed in the talk. With the successful operation of the Herschel observatory we are now in the position to search for massive pre-stellar cores in the IRDCs. The discovery of the first examples for such objects will be highlighted in the talk.

Speaker:	Prof. Thomas Henning (MPIA)
Topic:		Physics of Star Formation
Time:		11/8 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:		 Physics Building R104
Abstract:
Star formation is a fundamental process in the universe, shaping the structure of our and other galaxies. The talk will summarize the general principles of the star formation process. It will discuss global properties such as the star formation efficiency and the initial mass function. In addition, it will also demonstrate the power of adaptive optics in revealing the structure of star-forming regions.
