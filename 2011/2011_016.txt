Registration for PASCOS 2011, the 17th International Symposium on
Particles, Strings and Cosmology, is now open.  This conference will be
held in the University of Cambridge's award-winning Centre for
Mathematical Sciences from 3rd to 8th July 2011.  The aim of the
conference is to explore and develop synergies between particle physics,
string theory and cosmology.  This is a particularly timely meeting
given ongoing flagship experiments like the Large Hadron Collider at
CERN and the Planck satellite.  We have booked an international line-up
of 26 speakers, all of them leaders in these fields.

Registration for PASCOS 2011 costs GBP 160 (a discounted rate of GBP 100
applies to PhD students); this includes all talks, the Sunday evening
reception and lunches.  Accommodation and the conference banquet are
charged separately.  If you wish to attend PASCOS 2011, you may register
online by going to:-

http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/research/gr/workshops/PASCOS/2011/

Select the section marked 'Registration', then click on the link 'PASCOS
2011 Online Booking'.  The PASCOS website gives further information on
speakers, accommodation and where to find us.  Any problems, please
e-mail: pascos@damtp.cam.ac.uk.

Please note that places are strictly limited and the meeting is expected
to be over-subscribed, so register early.

                     ALMA User Workshop

                       Feb 26-27, 2011

    Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Academia Sinica

       http://events.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/workshop/20110226/

            Registration Deadline: Feb 11, 2011

Announcement:

The Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics at Academia Sinica (ASIAA)
announces its second workshop for Taiwanese ALMA users. The workshop is
oriented for all astronomers, regardless of specialty.


The ALMA observatory is in construction at the present, with 9 antennas 
already at the Array Operations Site (AOS). The first call for proposals 
will be issued on March 31, 2011 for the Early Science (ES). This ALMA 
workshop is designed to provide users with the update of ALMA project and 
the capabilities in the phase of ES, and to familiarize users with the 
(updated) tools for preparing and submitting their proposals, along with 
hands-on exercises, right before the call for proposals. An additional 
workshop will be organized later (likely in May) after the call for 
proposals when the capabilities in the ES phase are finalized, and the 
users are preparing or finishing up their proposals. Note that, more 
workshops will be organized later for observing preparation and data 
reduction, once the users are required to provide the detailed information 
for the execution of the observations.

The organizing committee encourages all the Taiwanese astronomers and
scholars interested in observing with ALMA to take part in this workshop.
Students coming from outside Taipei City/County can apply for travel support
from ASIAA for the transportation and accommodation, and this support is
sponsored by tuCASA. Due to limited space and the hands-on nature of this
workshop, participation will be limited to 80 people.

The program of the workshop will include:

    1. ALMA capabilities in Early Science and Full Operation phases
    2. Observing with ALMA and user supports from ARCs, Taiwan-ARC node, & tuCASA
    3. ALMA softwares for preparing, submitting, and tracking proposals: User Portal, Help-Desk, Observing Tool, Splatalogue
    4. CASA SIMDATA imaging simulation for observation planning
    5. Hands-on exercise on proposal preparation and submission

Actions

    1. For the participants with less experience in Radio Interferometry, please attend the ALMA Novice-User Workshop 2010 in advance.
    2. Each participant should have browsed through the presentation files in our first ALMA user workshop.
    3. Each participant should have read the ALMA Primer and looked through the Science Web pages.
    4. Everyone who is coming to the workshop should try preparing their own favorite proposal BEFORE coming to the workshop.
    5. Each participant is encouraged to have worked through a ES SIMDATA example (to be provided later).
