*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________
Speaker:    Tetsuya Hashimoto (NTHU)
Topic:         No redshift evolution of non-repeating fast radio-burst rates
Time:         9/30 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:          R1203
Abstract:
Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond transients of unknown origin(s)
occurring at cosmological distances. Here we, for the first time, show
time-integrated-luminosity functions and volumetric occurrence rates of
non-repeating and repeating FRBs against redshift. The
time-integrated-luminosity
functions of non-repeating FRBs do not show any significant redshift
evolution. The volumetric occurrence rates are almost constant during
the past ~10 Gyr. The nearly-constant rate is consistent with a flat trend
of cosmic stellar-mass density traced by old stellar populations. Our
findings indicate that the occurrence rate of non-repeating FRBs follows
the stellar-mass evolution of long-living objects with ~Gyr time scales,
favouring e.g. white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes, as likely
progenitors of non-repeating FRBs. In contrast, the occurrence rates of
repeating FRBs may increase towards higher redshifts in a similar way to
the cosmic star formation-rate density or black hole accretion-rate density
if the slope of their luminosity function does not evolve with redshift.
Short-living objects with <~Myr time scales associated with young stellar
populations (or their remnants, e.g., supernova remnants, young pulsars,
and magnetars) or active galactic nuclei might be favoured as progenitor
candidates of repeating FRBs.
