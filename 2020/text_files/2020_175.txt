Could you please circulate the following information of the 7th KAGRA
International Workshop? Thanks.

------------------------
Dear all,

The 7th KAGRA international workshop (KIW) will be held on 18-20 December
2020 in National Central University, Taoyuan City, Taiwan. KIW focuses not
only the KAGRA project, but also encompasses all related fields such as
other gravitational wave experiments, gravitational wave sciences, and
multi-messenger astronomy.
KIW started in 2016 with a purpose to promote the world-wide gravitational
wave observation. This workshop has been coordinated by the KAGRA
scientific congress board and host region.
This workshop will cover various topics related to gravitational
observation; development and characterization of the current and future
detector, data analysis, and recent observational results (the results of
O3a, from April 2019 to September 2019 by LIGO and Virgo).  We encourage
researchers of both experiment and theory, especially of young generations,
to make contributions and exchange the ideas at this KIW7.

Due to the world-wide pandemic of COVID-19, we decided to employ the hybrid
style. You can attend workshop in face or online.
The meeting information is summarized as follows:

Name: The 7th KAGRA international workshop
Place: National Central University (Taiwan)
Date: 2020 Dec.18(Fri.) 13:00 - Dec.20 (Sun) 16:00, 2020 (UTC+8)
Meeting style: (Hybrid: In face + Online(Zoom))
Web page (Registration page): https://indico.phys.sinica.edu.tw/event/16/
Registration Deadline: Dec.10 2020 (
https://indico.phys.sinica.edu.tw/event/16/registrations/13/)
Abstract Deadline: Nov.20 2020 (
https://indico.phys.sinica.edu.tw/event/16/abstracts/)
Registration fee: NT2000 for in face (including lunch and dinner), Free for
Online

We are looking forward to meeting you in the 7th KIW meeting.

Best regards,
Yuki Inoue on behalf of LOC and KSC board

*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________
Speaker:    Chin-Ping Hu (National Changhua University of Education (NCUE))
Topic:         Exploring Physics in Extreme Conditions through Multi-Wavelength and Multi-Messenger Observations on Compact Objects
Time:         11/11 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:          R1203
Abstract:
Compact objects are natural laboratories to test fundamental physics in extreme conditions. Our knowledge of them grows dramatically with the improvement of new theoretical models, observational instruments, analysis techniques, and computing power. For example, the simultaneous observations made with NICER and ground-based radio telescope allow us to detect the X-ray enhancement during the giant radio pulse in Crab pulsar. Furthermore, advanced and automated algorithms are needed in exploring hidden physics and searching for new objects as new data formats are born and a huge amount of data is accumulated. I will introduce my recent works on developing and applications of time-frequency analysis algorithms, including a systematic search for ultraluminous X-ray pulsars that challenges the current understandings of magnetospheric accretion onto neutron stars, and a study of time-frequency properties of gravitational wave signals from both coalescence of compact objects and co!
 re-collapse supernovae. Finally, I will introduce an X-ray CubeSat project that aims for continuous gravitational waves from compact objects, follow-up observations of transient events, and non-stationary phenomena around super-massive black holes.

Subject: [CAG special seminar] 2020/11/19 10:30 am Lunar Bombardment by Ya Huei Huang

Dear all,=20

In two weeks (Nov 19) we will have a special seminar on the Moon
Bombardment by Ya Huei Huang. Ya Huei works on numerical simulations to
reconstruct the Solar System history under constraints brought to us by
space missions. =20

Title:Earth's Moon Bombardment History Revealed by Apollo Samples and
Crustal Porosity=20

Abstract: Earth's Moon is a unique place where information regarding the
remnants from the Solar System's evolution is thought to be best
documented at its surface and in its returned samples. Deciphering the
temporal and spatial variation of impacts from those records is
challenging because those impacts vary in a wide range of sizes from
meteoroid impacts to basin formation. Here we present models constrained
by in-situ samples and spacecraft data to provide an insight into the
lunar bombardment history.=20
