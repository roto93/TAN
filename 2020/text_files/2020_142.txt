Dear all,

It has been a while since ALMA antennas have pointed towards the sky. =
Many of you have used this time to mine the ALMA archive, do great =
science and contemplate about your past experience with ALMA data and =
the services, tools and user support offered since Cycle 0.

While the antennas are taking an unanticipated break, ALMA is launching =
a new global project to Redesign the User eXperience (RedUX). As part of =
RedUX we will establish focus groups to discuss specific aspects of the =
ALMA user experience. By volunteering to join a focus group, you can =
help shape the future of ALMA. If you are interested in contributing to =
RedUX (and in receiving a small gift at the end of the exercise, as a =
token of our appreciation for your contribution), please=C2=A0fill in =
this form =
<https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSduAcrbUp0dPOMt0AEOvTbGgeBmtmMuF=
_Vz5oevVwdbG0XXEw/viewform>. The form is not anonymous, as we need your =
contact details in order to be able to get in touch with you.

For more information, please contact Yoshito SHIMAJIRI (NAOJ, =
yoshito.shimajiri@nao.ac.jp) or me.

best,
Yu-Nung
