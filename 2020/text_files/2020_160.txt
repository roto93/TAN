Dear all,=20

This Friday we will have a CAG seminar at Room B101 (not S101!). Dr.
Ting-Wen Lan (=E8=97=8D=E9=BC=8E=E6=96=87), postdoc at UC Santa Cruz, wil=
l talk about how one
can statistically constrain galaxy evolution with data from all-sky
surveys.=20

Please reply to the link by Thursday noon if you would like to have a
lunch box.

Title: Probing galaxy evolution with absorption line spectroscopy=20

Abstract: Understanding how galaxies form and evolve has been one of the
most important topics in astronomy. In the past two decades, astronomers
have realized that gas flow processes, gas accretion and outflows, play
a crucial role in galaxy evolution. The processes regulate the amount of
gas in and out of galaxies and leave their signatures in gas around
galaxies. In this talk, I will introduce absorption line spectroscopy, a
powerful technique to probe gas around galaxies and to reveal the gas
flow processes. I will show that by applying novel statistical
techniques to massive spectroscopic and photometric datasets from sky
surveys, one can obtain unprecedented measurements of the gas
properties, including the metal abundance, gas density, and its
distribution around galaxies. Finally, I will discuss how these gas
properties can place strong constraints on the models of galaxy
evolution.
