Update on the Status of ALMA Cycles 7 and 8

On behalf of the ALMA Director, with support from all Executives, the recent decisions taken regarding the status of Cycle 7 and Cycle 8 are as follows:

    â€¢ The start of ALMA Cycle 8 has been postponed until 2021 October. It is anticipated that the Cycle 8 Call for Proposals will open again in 2021 March.
    â€¢ ALMA Cycle 7 will continue through 2021 September, with currently non-completed projects ranked A, B and C remaining in the observing queue.
There remain many questions outstanding regarding resuming observations and accepting future proposals during these uncertain times.  ALMA is working on these questions and will provide a next update to the community in the coming weeks.

The Regional ARCs continue to provide support to their communities. Please contact the ALMA Helpdesk at https://help.almascience.org if you have any questions, comments or concerns.
