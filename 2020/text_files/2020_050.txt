Dear colleagues,

regional partners, have decided to delay the proposal deadline for the =
ALMA Cycle 8 Call for Proposals to NO EARLIER than 1500 UT on 19 May, =
2020.=20

The Regional ARCs have adjusted working conditions to support the Cycle =
8 Call and, as of now, can provide support to their communities.  Please =
contact the ALMA Helpdesk (https://help.almascience.org) with any =
questions or concerns regarding the ALMA Cycle 8 Call or any other =
issues.

As we continue to monitor the conditions worldwide, we will assess the =
feasibility of this deadline and provide additional updates to the =
community as needed.  The next update to the community will be provided =
NO LATER than 21 April, 2020 on the status of the call and the support =
for the scientific community at the ARCs.

We realize these are challenging and uncertain times.  We want to =
continue to hear your concerns (please submit Helpdesk tickets) and will =
take the appropriate action to address them.  It=E2=80=99s important now =
to consider the health and well-being of yourself and those around you =
=E2=80=93 that should be the primary focus as we navigate through these =
stressful times.
