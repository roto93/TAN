NEXT Colloquium: 2020-10-14 Wed 14:20~15:20 [R1203]
Speaker:    Aniket Agrawal
Topic:    Probing the early Universe with gravitational waves
Abstract:    Observations of the cosmic microwave background over the last two=
 decades hint that all structure in our Universe, including us, arose from =
quantum fluctuations at its birth. One key piece in confirming this picture=
, however, remains missing. In this talk, I will describe how observations =
of gravitational waves from the very beginning of our Universe can provide =
this missing piece. I will also talk about how we can use these primordial =
gravitational waves to probe the constituents of our Universe at its moment=
 of birth, and how they might provide possibly the only evidence for quantu=
m gravity.

Topic:         Core mass function in low-metallicity environment
Time:         10/12 (Monday) 12:15 - 13:15
Place:          R1203
Abstract:
Understanding the origin of stellar initial mass function (IMF) is a cent=
ral issue in the study of star formation. The past studies of dense cores r=
eported that the slope of the stellar IMF and core mass function (CMF) are =
consistent, suggesting that the fundamental mass distribution of stars is d=
etermined during the early stage of the core formation. However, dense core=
s have been observed and studied only in the inner part of the Galactic pla=
ne (including the solar neighborhood), which has similar metallicity to tha=
t of the solar neighborhood. Thus, an important question to address is whet=
her the same relation between the CMF and stellar IMF holds true even in lo=
w-metallicity environments. To solve this question, we performed CO and dus=
t continuum ALMA high-resolution (~0.1 pc scale) mapping observation toward=
 a massive star-forming molecular cloud in the outer Galaxy, which has much=
 lower gas density and lower metallicity (~20 % of the solar neighborhood v=
alue) than those!
  in the solar neighborhood . As the results, we successfully detected ~0=
.1 pc-wide filament structures and ~0.1 pc-scale dense core structures in t=
he outer Galaxy for the first time. We also found that the slope of the CMF=
 in the outer Galaxy is similar to that of the universal IMF. These results=
 suggest that the star-formation processes in the low-metallicity environme=
nt follow a universal law.
