Topic:         Preparing the ingredients of planet-forming disks
Time:         7/20 (Monday) 12:15 - 13:15
Place:          R1203
Abstract:
Accretion disks are a common structure in the universe. Young stars grow by accreting the material from the disk that also forms planets. Only in recent years that it is possible to study the detailed structure of these young disks. Yet, it is still not fully understood how disks form around young protostars. By comparing the observed dust and gas structures to numerical models, it might give insights to how the material is transported from the early stages of star formation to the young planet-forming disk. In order to obtain a more complete picture, the dust, gas and ice composition of the young disk is compared with meteorites.  The history and physics of star formation can be better understood by knowing the ingredients (dust, ice and gas) of the young disk.

Topic:         Cosmic rays in distant galaxies: the impact of the unseen
Time:         7/22 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:          R1203
Abstract:
At high redshifts, protogalaxies were forming their first generations of stars in intense bursts. During their active phases, these starburst galaxies would presumably be environments rich in energetic cosmic rays due to the presence of massive stars and their remnants. Stellar remnants can supply seed particles and generate the shocks (via supernova explosions and other violent events) needed to accelerate the seeds to very high energies. I will present an overview of my current research activities, which consider the effects these energetic cosmic rays can have on the early Universe, particularly on the formation and evolution of the galaxies therein. I will outline how these energetic particles can interact with protogalactic environments, and discuss the impacts they may have on the evolution and star-formation histories of their hosts, how their astrophysical effects can manifest themselves on galactic, sub-galactic and super-galactic scales, and how their signatures mi!
 ght be observed in the CTA era.
