Dear all,=20

Next Friday (Nov 06) our CAG seminar will focus on observations of
stellar flares. Li-Ching Huang will talk to us about possible
implications of flare activities on binary stars or on exoplanets.=20

Title: Flare Activity of Eclipsing Binary and Exoplanet Systems=20

Abstract: Flare activity is an important phenomena caused by the
chromosphere activity in late-type stars. We collected the light curve
data from Kepler telescope and spectral data from ground-based
telescopes for detecting flare events and measuring the chromospheric
active levels of late-type stars with exoplanets or in binary systems.
Our result agrees with the previous studies that slow rotators are less
active than fast rotators and the stars with exoplanets tend to have
less flare activity and lower chromospheric activity levels. M-type
eclipsing binaries (EBs) show less flare events with large flares
(energy release 10^34 ergs) than the hyperflaring M dwarfs, but their
cumulative flare frequency factor is 10 times higher than the flaring
single M dwarfs. The flare timing also shows that the secondary stars
might be the major flare producers in some EB systems. Flare activity is
also important to the habitability of the exoplanets. Stars with less
frequent superflares provide better environments for life development,
especially for the M-type stars, whose longevity and abundance make them
good environments for habitable exoplanets. Kepler-442 is a K-type
main-sequence star with an earth size exoplanet (2.3 M_earth) in the
habitable zone. Flare events are detected on this star, which is
different from our result that exoplanet systems rarely show flare
activity.
