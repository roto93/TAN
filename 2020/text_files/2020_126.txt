Dear Yi-Jehng,

I would appreciate it if you could circulate the =E2=80=9CCall for SMA =
Call for Standard
Observing Proposals - 2020B semester=E2=80=9D to TAN.

Thank you,
Naomi

Dear Colleagues,
After a 10 week closure in response to the coronavirus pandemic, the =
Submillimeter Array restarted limited operations in June 2020, and =
continues to operate at a somewhat reduced schedule (5 nights out of 7). =
We anticipate that we will be able to maintain this cadence and =
hopefully expand it in the coming months, along with continued =
development and deployment of enhanced capabilities.
=20
We now warmly welcome submission of proposals for the upcoming 2020B =
semester. In 2020B, the fraction of time available may be somewhat =
reduced, depending on safety protocols in place as a response to the =
coronavirus pandemic. We actively solicit projects of all sizes, and we =
are particularly interested in increasing the number of smaller =
proposals that take just a few hours in time, projects that are =
especially time critical (such as coordinated observing campaigns and =
ToO triggered event programs), and in monitoring type proposals.
=20
Information on the array and the submission process are provided =
below, and we are available to answer questions or point you to any =
information you may need.

The latest Call for Standard Observing Proposals for observations with =
the Submillimeter Array (SMA) is for the 2020B semester with observing =

Standard Observing Proposals

Proposal Information and Submission =
<http://sma1.sma.hawaii.edu/proposing.html>
The SMA is a reconfigurable interferometric array of eight 6-m =
antennas on Maunakea jointly built and operated by the Smithsonian =
Astrophysical Observatory and the Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy =
and Astrophysics. The array operates in the 230, 345 and 400 GHz bands, =
observing simultaneously with two orthogonally polarized receivers, one =
in the 230 GHz or 345 GHz band and the other in the 240 GHz or 400 GHz =
band (with full polarimetric observations available using the 230+240 or =
345+400 band combinations).
=20
The SMA configurations include antenna separations ranging between 9 m =
and 508 m. The small antennas allow access to low spatial frequencies =
(with projected baselines as short as 6-m) in the sub-compact =
configuration, and at the other extreme, the finest angular resolution =
with the very extended configuration at 345 GHz is ~ 0.25". The compact =
and extended configurations complete the range. The characteristics, =
performance and sky coverage of the SMA are both similar and =
complementary to those of the stand-alone Atacama Compact Array (ACA) =
component of ALMA, while providing full access to the northern sky.
=20
The heart of the SMA backend is the SWARM correlator, now able to =
process up to 12 GHz bandwidth (IF coverage of 4 to 16 GHz) for each =
receiver in each sideband, for a total of 48 GHz bandwidth, at a uniform =
140 kHz resolution. We are offering this new expanded coverage in 2020B =
as a shared-risk opportunity.
=20
The SMA can tune the orthogonal receiver combinations independently, =
resulting in a very flexible frequency coverage capability. For example, =
observations can be made at 1.3 mm and 870 micron simultaneously (with =
many other configurations possible). One popular configuration allows =
the 12 GHz/sideband/receiver frequency coverage to cover up to 44 GHz =
contiguously (with 4 GHz covered with both receivers), where the tuning =
ranges overlap for the two orthogonally polarized receivers. =
Alternatively, the two receivers can be set with the same LO to cover =
the same 24 GHz (12 GHz in each sideband) of frequency space in the two =
orthogonal polarizations, allowing improved spectral line sensitivity. =
In such a case, full Stokes polarization measurements are also possible =
at 1.3 mm and 870 microns.=20
=20
The SMA provides flexible, wide band frequency coverage that delivers =
high continuum sensitivity and excellent spectral line capabilities. A =
full transit observation with the 12 GHz/sideband/receiver correlator =
coverage will offer continuum sensitivity of 200 or 500 micro-Jy (1 =
sigma) at 230 or 345 GHz in good weather conditions (precipitable water =
vapor 2.5 mm and 1.0 mm, respectively). The corresponding line =
sensitivities at 1 km/s resolution are 35 and 80 mJy.

set of SMA proposing tools <http://sma1.sma.hawaii.edu/tools.html>. =
Current and archived SMA Newsletters =
<https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/sma/Newsletters/> provide a sampling of the =
wide variety of science possible with the SMA.

IMPORTANT DATES FOR STANDARD OBSERVING PROPOSALS

Due to current and expected investment in further upgrades to the SMA =
capabilities, delays due to the coronavirus pandemic, as well as =
obligations to previous approved programs, the Large Scale Projects =
program (for projects requesting 100 to 1000 hours) will not be =
accepting proposals at this time for SAO. The ASIAA Key Projects program =
is accepting proposals for eligible investigators.
