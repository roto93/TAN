Subject: [EAVN2020B] Call for Proposals for EAVN for the 2020B semester
Date: Thu, 30 Apr 2020 08:42:11 +0000

Dear colleagues,

This e-mail is to announce 'Call for Proposals (CfP) for the East Asian
VLBI Network (EAVN)' for the 2020B semester. EAVN will be operated using
8 telescopes (KVN (3), VERA-Mizusawa, Tianma, Nanshan, Nobeyama, and
Takahagi) in the 2020B semester. Please refer to the following EAVN
website for more details about the array's specification, available
observation modes, and how to submit proposals.

https://eavn.kasi.re.kr/

Best regards,

Kiyoaki Wajima
(KASI; in place of EAVN directors)

***************************************************
Call for Proposals for the East Asian VLBI Network (EAVN)
for the 2020B semester
Proposal submission deadline: 15th June, 2020, 8:00 UT
EAVN website: https://eavn.kasi.re.kr/
***************************************************

--- Major revisions from the 2020A semester ---
* EAVN is operated using 8 telescopes due to reduction of VERA's telescope
  (Iriki, Ishigakijima, and Ogasawara)
* Following new observation modes are opened.
  - Dual-frequency (22/43 GHz) simultaneous data reception
    (KaVA and Nobeyama)
  - Phase-referencing mode (KaVA and Nanshan)
-----------------------------------------------


*** Overview ***
We invite proposals for open-use observations with the East Asian VLBI
Network (EAVN), which is the international collaborative VLBI array
between China, Korea, and Japan. In the 2020B semester, 8 telescopes
(VERA Mizusawa 20 m, KVN 3 x 21 m, Nobeyama 45 m, Takahagi 32 m, Tianma
65 m, and Nanshan 26 m) participate in the EAVN open-use program.


*** Observing mode ***
EAVN provides an opportunity of VLBI observations with a data recording
rate of 1 Gbps (total bandwidth of 256 MHz and with single polarization
(LHCP) at 22 and 43 GHz. From the 2020B semester, dual-frequency (22 and
43 GHz) simultaneous observation system can be used for EAVN observations
at KaVA and Nobeyama. Phase-referencing mode is also provided with KaVA
and Nanshan. Please refer to the EAVN status report on the EAVN
website for more details.


*** Telescope time ***
The total available observation time for EAVN is up to 500 hours in the
2020B semester, while the available observing time for individual EAVN
telescopes are different. All EAVN observations will be allocated from
1st September 2020 to 15th January 2021. Please refer to the EAVN status
report on the EAVN website for more details.

EAVN accepts a request of usage of sub-array configuration (KaVA 4
telescopes and additional telescopes from non-KaVA stations), as well
as EAVN full array configuration.

The maximum request time for a single EAVN proposal is limited to 24 hours
in case of usage of EAVN (KaVA and additional telescopes from non-KaVA
stations), while no limitation of the maximum request time is set in case
of usage of only KaVA 4 telescopes. Proposers can request their project to
be allocated over a year until the end of the 2021A semester (10th June,
2021), while the total request time is still limited as shown above for
each EAVN proposal.


*** Target of opportunity ***
EAVN accepts target of opportunity (ToO) proposals, while Nobeyama and
Takahagi cannot be included for ToO proposals. It is strongly recommended
that ToO proposals (especially expected ToO) are submitted during the
regular CfP. Unexpected or urgent ToO can be submitted as Director's
Discretionary Time (DDT) proposals at any time. ToO proposals must
include clear triggering criteria to initiate an observation. ToOs
are valid for one year after it is approved. ToO proposals for DDT
should follow the same way of regular call and should be submitted via
the EAVN website.


*** Proposal submission ***
Proposals should be submitted via EAVN website. Proposal submission
deadline is 15th June 2020, 8:00 UT. Please refer to the EAVN status
report for detailed information about the proposal format. The designated
coversheet form can be downloaded from the EAVN websites.
