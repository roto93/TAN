Dear all,

    The ALMA Cycle 8 2021 Pre-announcement has been released.=20

    Following the postponement of Cycle 8 because of the COVID-19 =
pandemic, the Joint ALMA Observatory (JAO) will now start the next cycle =
of observations, referred to as "Cycle 8 2021", in October 2021. A Call =
for Proposals (CfP) with detailed information on Cycle 8 2021 is =
anticipated to be issued in March 2021 and the deadline for proposal =
submission will be in April 2021.  The purpose of this pre-announcement =
is to highlight aspects of the CfP to assist with early planning, and it =
includes newly updated information over the previous pre-announcement =
delivered for Cycle 8 in December 2019.  As the global response to the =
pandemic continues to evolve, we encourage interested parties to follow =
the ALMA Science Portal for the latest information.

The key dates (anticipated) for Cycle 8 2021 are:    =09

Updates to the Proposal Review Process=20
    =E2=80=A2 ALMA will adopt a distributed peer review process for =
scientific review of most proposals submitted to Cycle 8 2021. After a =
successful pilot run in the Cycle 7 Supplemental Call (see ALMA Memo =
616), distributed peer review will be used for all proposals requesting =
less than 25 hours on the 12-m Array, and ACA stand-alone proposals =
requesting less than 150 hours on the 7-m Array. In this review system, =
for each submitted proposal the PI (or one of the delegated co-Is) will =
be responsible for reviewing up to 10 other submitted proposals, thus =
increasing the involvement of the ALMA community in the review process.
    =E2=80=A2 Large proposals and proposals requesting more than 25 =
hours on the 12-m Array will be reviewed by science review panels, as in =
previous cycles.=20
    =E2=80=A2 ALMA encourages PIs to submit larger, more ambitious =
proposals. Therefore, there is no longer a cap on the total time that =
can be allocated to Large Programs. Further, Large Programs andproposals =
that require more than 25 hours on the 12-m Array will have first =
priority to fill at least 10% of the observing queue. =20
    =E2=80=A2 All Cycle 8 2021 proposals will be reviewed using a =
dual anonymous procedure.  While proposers will still enter their names =
and affiliations in the Observing Tool, their identities will be =
concealed from the reviewers.  It will be the responsibility of the =
investigators to write their proposals such that anonymity is preserved. =
 By using this procedure, we aim to minimize unconscious bias.  =
Guidelines on preparing anonymous proposals will be made available prior =
to the time of the CfP.

New in Cycle 8 2021    =E2=80=94 The following technical capabilities =
will be available this Cycle for the first time:
    =E2=80=A2 Solar observations in Band 5
    =E2=80=A2 A passive-phasing mode that allows observations of =
fainter VLBI targets (Bands 3 and 6), and can also be used in an =
ALMA-only mode primarily for observations of pulsars (Band 3). This mode =
can be used to observe sources with a correlated flux density < 500 mJy =
within an unresolved core on ALMA baselines up to 1 km, but requires =
there to be a bright calibrator close to the science target.
    =E2=80=A2 High frequency observations (Bands 9 and 10) with the =
stand-alone 7-m Array
    =E2=80=A2 Mosaicking of continuum linear polarization =
observations (Bands 3 to 7) with the 12-m Array
    =E2=80=A2 Spectral scans with the 7-m Array
    =E2=80=A2 Up to a total of 75 hours of full polarization =
observations of a single field with the 7-m Array in stand-alone mode at =
the Main Call only
