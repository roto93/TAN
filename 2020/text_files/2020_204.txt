Speaker:    [Pizza lunch] Ayala Loera, Ma Del Carmen (ASIAA)
Topic:         Trans-Neptunian objects: Colors and microscopic properties of their surfaces
Time:         12/28 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:          R1203
Abstract:
Trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) are the most distant and faintest airless bodies in the Solar System we know so far. As they reflect the Sun's light, the TNOs absolute magnitude estimations must consider i) the geometry of the observation, and ii) the effects of light interaction with the surface. The wide range in color observed from photometric surveys of this population, do not show clear relations with dynamical or physical properties. In this talk I will address the importance of photometric studies in order to estimate the surface composition of TNOs, due to the fact that their spectra are almost featureless. I will talk about the goals of photometric techniques in TNOs composition research, as well as the relation between what we define as absolute colors, and their phase coefficients and albedo.
