AS/NTU Joint Colloquium: 2020-10-20 Tue 14:20~15:20 [CCMS R104]
Speaker:    You-Hua Chu
Topic:    CSI: Type Ia Supernova Remnant in Taiwan
Abstract:    Searching for clues on supernovae (SNe) from their supernova remn=
ants (SNRs) is like a crime scene investigation (CSI). This talk is based o=
n Type Ia SNR work by my students and postdoc in Taiwan. Type Ia SNe have b=
een used as standardizable candles to discover the accelerated expansion of=
 the Universe; however, we still are not certain how Type Ia SNe exploded e=
xactly. Two popular scenarios have been suggested, one involves a white dwa=
rf (WD) having accreted too much material from a normal-star companion, and=
 the other involves merger of two WDs. In the former scenario, the stellar =
companion survives the SN explosion, while in the latter scenario no stella=
r remnant is left. We have been studying the Type Ia SNRs in our neighborin=
g galaxy the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), using Hubble Space Telescope ima=
ges to search for surviving companions of their SN progenitors and dense ci=
rcumstellar material ejected by the SN progenitors. I will report our findi=
ngs and suggest possible explosion mechanisms. I will also report on our se=
arch for young Type Ia SNRs in the M33 galaxy. The goal of this research is=
 to understand the explosion mechanisms of Type Ia SNe.

Topic:         PHANGS and its view of gas and star formation distributions in n=
earby galaxies
Time:         10/21 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:          R1203
Abstract:
Star formation in galaxies is determined by the efficiency of the convers=
ion of gas to stars and stellar feedback that shapes the reservoir of gas f=
or future star formation. In this talk, I will introduce the PHANGS survey =
(Physics at High ANgular resolution in Nearby GalaxieS), a large multi-wave=
length project to survey nearby galaxies at ~100-pc scale in molecular gas,=
 star-forming regions, and stellar clusters, aiming to study the link betwe=
en the small-scale physics of gas and star formation and galaxy properties =
and  evolution.

I will also show you the preliminary results that probe the global proper=
ty dependency of the relative distribution of molecular gas and star format=
ion in nearby galaxies. We employ a simple approach to quantify the distrib=
utions of regions with different evolutionary stages of star formation: fro=
m quiescent molecular gas, to star-forming gas, and to regions of massive s=
tar formation only. At the best-match resolution of 150 pc, the distributio=
n of regions with different evolutionary stages show a dependence on the st=
ellar mass and morphology of galaxies, both globally and locally. Galactic =
dynamics (e.g., bar and spiral arms) also add to the complexity of the star=
 formation process. Our results highlight the potential importance of galax=
y properties for the gas-star formation cycle, and imply a global-property-=
dependent Kennicutt=E2=80=93Schmidt relation. However, any trends between g=
alaxy properties and molecular gas and HII region distributions is visible =
only when the observed!
 spatial scale is smaller than ~500 pc, indicating a critical resolution =
requirement to resolve the dependency.
