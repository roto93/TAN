*NTHU/NCTS Astronomy Winter School: High-Energy Astrophysics*
Jan 18th =E2=80=93 22nd
*Online, and NCTS, Hsinchu*

We are pleased to announce the NTHU/NCTS Winter School on High-Energy
Astrophysics, to be held both online and at the National Center for
Theoretical Science, Hsinchu, Taiwan, January 18th =E2=80=93 22nd, 2021.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Registration is now open. Please complete registration here:
http://phys.cts.nthu.edu.tw/actnews/intro.php?Sn=3D505&OSn=3D1349
You can indicate whether you will attend on-site or remotely.
*Registration deadline: 20th December 2020.*
------------------------------------------------------------------------
We cordially invite your participation.
The purpose of this winter school is to present an overview of the progress
in major areas of cosmic ray astrophysics and gamma-ray astronomy in recent
years, and to provide an introduction to the essential physics and
concepts. It will also be an opportunity to bring together both new and
established researchers in the field for discussion and exchange of ideas\.
The programme will cover a broad range of topics within cosmic ray
astrophysics and gamma-ray astronomy, ranging from theory/modelling &
simulation to instrumentation & observation.

The school is intended for graduate research (PhD and Masters) students and
post-docs with an interest in becoming involved in high energy astrophysics
(in particular, topics relating to cosmic rays and gamma-rays), as well as
early-career scientists already active in the field looking to broaden
their understanding. It will comprise of a keynote lecture and six primary
lecture series from international experts, plus five highlight science
talks to complement the programme. The keynote lecture will be given by
Prof Werner Hofmann (Max-Planck-Institut f=C3=BCr Kernphysik, Heidelberg,
Germany).

Please see our website for detailed information about the lecturers,
courses and highlight talks:
