Dear TAN colleagues,

Please find below an announcement of ASIAA 2020 Summer Student Program. Please circulate this announcement around you if you know students who might be interested in our program.

Due to the Coronavirus issue we have shorten our program period to be only 1.5 months this summer. In addition, the Coronavirus issue might further affect the program if the problem cannot not be solved before summer. Sp please pay attention to our important notice on the 2020 program.

Sincerely,
Youichi Ohyama (chair, summer student program, ASIAA)

Dear all,

Call for applicants, 2020 Summer Student Program at Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA)

# The information is also available on-line at https://events.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/ssp/2020/

# Due to current Coronavirus issue and the relevant future unknowns, we modified/may further adjust the program this summer. See below for more notes.

Are you interested in astronomy and astrophysical research? Are you looking for a full-time summer intern to participate the academic research of the astronomy, astrophysics, or astronomical instrumentation?

If so, then you are encouraged to apply for the ASIAA summer student program. Participants attend regular seminars designed specifically to teach them about the various fields in astronomy. They will also conduct scientific research (either theoretical, computational, or laboratory-based) under the supervision of a professional astronomer at ASIAA.

Time: July 13 - August 28, 2020

Qualified Applicants:
Undergraduate students majoring in astronomy, physics, chemistry, electrical engineering, computer science, or any related topics on science and engineering. All applicants will be considered, but juniors, seniors or entering master's students are preferred.

All applicants should fill the on-line form, which is found at https://events.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/ssp/2020/

Deadline for Application: 3/20

IMPORTANT NOTE on the 2020 program

According to recently revised university calendar (the semester and the summer vacation schedule) in Taiwan following the government's Coronavirus disease protection measure, we have revised our summer student program period to be 7/13-8/28. This year the program is only 1.5 month-long (our regular program is 2 month-long).

Given the Coronavirus outbreak, there are travel/visiting regulations/restrictions imposed by the government(s) on both ends and by our institution. (Note that the visa application is usually made at early May). If the local situation around ASIAA becomes very bad, we might need to cancel the entire summer student program even after confirming the students. The situation has been very dynamic and these regulations may change rapidly. The applicants need to understand the risk of their admission getting canceled or travel getting restricted due to unforeseen and unfortunate conditions.

Below you can find the latest information about the conditions in Taiwan and the government regulations from Taiwan Centers for Disease Control and Ministry of the Interior, National Immigration Agency of Taiwan.

Dear ALMA users,

The ALMA Regional Center (Taiwan-ARC) of ASIAA and the University
Consortium of ALMA-Taiwan (UCAT) are pleased to host jointly a ALMA Users
Workshop for potential ALMA users in Taiwan on March 20 (Friday), an ALMA
Users Workshop 2020. Below is the announcement:

ALMA Users Workshop 2020
Time: March 20, 2020
Place: Room 1203, Astronomy-Mathematics Building, ASIAA
http://events.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/workshop/20200320/index.php
Registration Deadline: March 13, 2020.

The call for proposal for ALMA Cycle 8 will be issued on March 17th, 2020\.
The ALMA Cycle 8 Users Workshop is designed for preparing ALMA Cycle 8
proposals. It is intended for graduate students, postdocs, faculty members
and people who are interested in using ALMA. Due to safety concerns for
COVID-19 infection, we will also provide zoom meeting for remote
participants.

The program of the ALMA Users Workshop (March 20) includes:
ALMA cycle 8 information
Dual-anonyomous proposal review
Tools for proposal preparation

Best regards,
Tien-Hao Hsieh

*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________
Speaker:    Ray-Kuang Lee (Institute of Photonics Technologies, National Tsing Hua University)
Topic:         Frequency-dependent squeezed vacuum source for broadband quantum noise reduction in advanced gravitational-wave detectors
Time:         3/11 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:          R1203
Abstract:
The astrophysical reach of current and future ground-based gravitational-wave detectors is mostly limited by the quantum noise, induced by vacuum fluctuations entering the detector output port. The replacement of this ordinary vacuum field with a squeezed vacuum one has proven to be an effective strategy to mitigate such quantum noise and it is currently used in advanced detectors.  However, current squeezing cannot improve the noise in the whole spectrum, because of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: when shot noise at high frequencies is reduced, radiation pressure at low frequencies is increased. A broadband quantum noise reduction is possible by using a more complex squeezing source, obtained reflecting the squeezed vacuum off a Fabry-Perot cavity, known as filter cavity.
In this talk, I will report our recent implementation of squeezed vacuum states at 1064 nm. With a bow-tie optical parametric oscillator (OPO) cavity, and our home-made balanced homodyne detectors, noise reduction up to 10dB below the vacuum is measured.  Applications of our squeezer to the gravitational wave detection will be reported, for the first demonstration of a frequency dependent squeezed vacuum source able to reduce quantum noise of advanced gravitational-wave detectors in their whole observation bandwidth. The experiment uses a suspended 300 m long filter cavity at National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ), similar to the one planned for KAGRA, Advanced Virgo and Advanced LIGO, and capable to impress a rotation of the squeezing ellipse below 100 Hz.
