Hi everyone,

NRAO will hold a community event in NAOJ (Mitaka) on
March 31 and April 1.  It will be about introducing VLA and
VLBA to new users, including data reduction and observation
planning hands-on sessions.  You are welcome to go if you
need to learn about VLA and VLBA.

The website is:
https://science.nrao.edu/science/meetings/2020/naoj20

Cheers,
Wei-Hao

Dear Yi-Jehng,

I would appreciate it if you could circulate the SMA call for standard =
proposals.

Dear Colleagues,
=20
We wish to draw your attention to the latest Call for Standard =
Observing Proposals for observations with the Submillimeter Array (SMA). =
This call is for the 2020A semester with observing period 16 May 2020 =
=E2=80=93 15 Nov 2020.
Standard Observing Proposals
=20
Submission deadline: 05 Mar 2020 21:00 UTC =3D 05 Mar 2020 16:00 EST =3D=
 06 Mar 2020 05:00 Taiwan
=20
Proposal Information and Submission =
<http://sma1.sma.hawaii.edu/proposing.html>
The SMA is a reconfigurable interferometric array of eight 6-m =
antennas on Maunakea jointly built and operated by the Smithsonian =
Astrophysical Observatory and the Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy =
and Astrophysics. The array operates in the 230, 345 and 400 GHz bands, =
observing simultaneously with two orthogonally polarized receivers, one =
in the 230 GHz or 345 GHz band and the other in the 240 GHz or 400 GHz =
band (with full polarimetric observations available using the 230+240 or =
345+400 band combinations).
=20
The SMA configurations include antenna separations ranging between 9 m =
and 508 m. The small antennas allow access to low spatial frequencies =
(with projected baselines as short as 6-m) in the sub-compact =
configuration, and at the other extreme, the finest angular resolution =
with the very extended configuration at 345 GHz is ~ 0.25". The compact =
and extended configurations complete the range. The characteristics, =
performance and sky coverage of the SMA are both similar and =
complementary to those of the stand-alone Atacama Compact Array (ACA) =
component of ALMA, while providing full access to the northern sky.
=20
The heart of the SMA backend is the SWARM correlator, able to process =
8 GHz bandwidth (IF coverage of 4 to 12 GHz) for each receiver in each =
sideband, for a total of 32 GHz bandwidth, at a uniform 140 kHz =
resolution. We are currently expanding the correlator coverage by 50%, =
to 12 GHz bandwidth (IF coverage from 4 to 16 GHz) for each receiver in =
each sideband, for 48 GHz total bandwidth, while maintaining the fine =
140 kHz uniform resolution. While not yet fully commissioned, we are =
working toward offering this new capability in 2020A as a shared-risk =
opportunity.
=20
The SMA can tune the orthogonal receiver combinations independently, =
resulting in a very flexible frequency coverage capability. For example, =
observations can be made at 1.3 mm and 870 micron simultaneously (with =
many other configurations possible). One popular configuration allows =
the current 8 GHz/sideband/receiver frequency coverage to cover up to 32 =
GHz contiguously, where the tuning ranges overlap for the two =
orthogonally polarized receivers. Alternatively, the two receivers can =
be set with the same LO to cover the same 16 GHz (8 GHz in each =
sideband) of frequency space in the two orthogonally polarizations, =
allowing improved spectral line sensitivity. In such a case, full Stokes =
polarization measurements are also possible at 1.3 mm and 870 microns. =
When our upgrade is completed to 12 GHz/sideband/receiver, the frequency =
coverage will be configurable to cover 44 GHz contiguously (with 4 GHz =
of overlap), or can be configured to cover the same 24 GHz (12 GHz in =
each sideband) with the same LO.
=20
The SMA provides flexible, wide band frequency coverage that delivers =
high continuum sensitivity and excellent spectral line capabilities. A =
full transit observation with the current 8 GHz/sideband/receiver =
correlator coverage will offer continuum sensitivity of 250 or 600 =
micro-Jy (1 sigma) at 230 or 345 GHz in good weather conditions =
(precipitable water vapor 2.5 mm and 1.0 mm, respectively). When the =
correlator upgrade is fully commissioned this will improve the continuum =
sensitivities by 22% per unit time. The corresponding line sensitivities =
at 1 km/s resolution are 35 and 80 mJy.
=20

Center website <http://sma1.sma.hawaii.edu/status.html> and explore the =
set of SMA proposing tools <http://sma1.sma.hawaii.edu/tools.html>. =
Current and archived SMA Newsletters =
<https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/sma/Newsletters/> provide a sampling of the =
wide variety of science possible with the SMA.

IMPORTANT DATES FOR STANDARD OBSERVING PROPOSALS
=20
Submissions open: 06 February 2020 (on or before)
Submissions close: 05 Mar 2020 21:00 UTC =3D 05 Mar 2020 16:00 EST =3D =
06 Mar 2020 05:00 Taiwan
Due to current and expected investment in further upgrades to the SMA =
capabilities, as well as obligations to previous approved programs, the =
Large Scale Projects program (for projects requesting 100 to 1000 hours) =
will not be accepting proposals at this time.

Dear Yi-Jehng,

I would appreciate it if you could circulate the â€œCall for SMA-Taiwan
Key Science Proposalsâ€￾ to TAN.

Thank you,
Naomi

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear colleague,

The SMA-Taiwan (SMA-T) invites key science programs requiring substantial amount of time spreading over the multiple semesters.  The SMA-T key science project is aimed at achieving significant scientific impact using the capabilities of the SMA such as wide bandwidth and large field-of-view efficiently. The project will be conducted using the ASIAA time of the SMA, which is 13 % of the total SMA observing time. Each semester, approximately half of the ASIAA time will be allocated to the approved key science project.

Prospective PIs of the SMA-T key science projects need to submit a Notice of Intent (NoI) in advance of the submission of a full proposal. The full proposal must be submitted by the deadline of the regular science proposals.

The deadlines for consideration in the 2019B cycle are"
Notice of Intent: 2020 Fwb. 14 (Fri.) 24:00 CST
Full submission:: 2020 Mar. 6 (Fri.) 5:00 CST

For detail of the SMA-T Key Science Projects, please refer to
    http://sma.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/proposal_key.php

Note that this opportunity is open to the researchers in Taiwanese institutions including ASIAA Hawaii.

Questions may be addressed to
    hirano [at] asiaa [dot] sinica [dot] edu [dot] tw.


Regards,
Naomi Hirano (on behalf of the SMA-Taiwan)
