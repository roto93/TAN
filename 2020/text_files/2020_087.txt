Dear all,

On June 18th we will have Chieh-An Lin as our seminar speaker. Cheih-An is a cosmologist using statistical tools to work on weak gravitational lensing. He will be visiting us for the whole day, please let me know if you would like to come chat with him or join us for dinner.

Best regards,
Yueh-Ning

Venue: S102
Title: Cosmology with weak gravitational lensing
Abstract:
Weak gravitational lensing (WL) is the phenomenon of image distortion by gravitational light deflection. Images of background sources are distorted by foreground matter structures. By measuring the distortion to percentage levels, the state-of-the-art studies have found WL as a powerful tool to constrain cosmology. The upcoming Stage-IV surveys such as LSST and Euclid are expected to provide high-quality constraints comparable to Planck.
In this talk, I will provide an overview on up-to-date WL studies and surveys. This will include scientific motivations, an introduction to theoretical basis, observational challenges, state-of-the-art results, and future perspectives. The talk will be accessible for non-cosmologists.

Dear all,

  EA ARC at NAOJ provides the service to deliver calibrated MS on demand =
for PIs and archive users.=20
  The delivery service is offered for interferometric data which require =
CASA version 4.6.* or earlier only, basically corresponding to the data =
in Cycle 1-3 (calibrated MS are provided in the archive for Cycle 0).=20
   =20
  Below please find the detailed information from Fukagawa-san. Please =
request through the Helpdesk with necessary information as explained =
below.

best,
Yu-Nung

When you want to do imaging using ALMA interferometric data, you need =
to download raw data with the package including necessary scripts from =
the ALMA Science Archive, then run the calibration script using the =
right version of CASA shown in README (for Cycle 1-4) or =
qa2_report.html/pdf (for Cycle 5 and later) to produce the calibrated =
measurement sets (MS). However, it happens that you cannot calibrate the =
data since the recent Operating Systems are not officially supported for =
old versions of CASA.
=20
EA ARC provides the service to deliver calibrated MS on demand for PIs =
and archive users. Please request through the Helpdesk with necessary =
information as explained below. Please also note that we cannot deliver =
the data in a timely manner if many requests are received at the same =
time or requests include data with huge sizes. Thank you for your =
understanding for a possible delay of the delivery.
=20
-----------------------------------------------
- The delivery service is offered for interferometric data which =
require CASA version 4.6.* or earlier, basically corresponding to the =
data in Cycle 1-3 (calibrated MS are provided in the archive for Cycle =
0). The service is not offered for single-dish data.
- Please check the CASA version in README before you request the =
calibrated MS. Depending on the dataset, you do not have to download a =
package and can check README listed as the individual file in the data =
request page. If README with CASA version is not listed, you need to =
download the package ('product' package for Cycle 3 and earlier). The =
following list shows CASA versions that were used for data calibration. =
This does not always apply depending on the timing of QA2, but we hope =
that this helps before you look for the CASA versions to request the =
calibrated MS.
=20
    #cycle     CASA_version
    1 (2012.*)       4.2.0 - 4.2.1
    2 (2013.*)       4.2.2 - 4.4.0
    3 (2015.*)       4.3.1 - 4.6.0
    4 (2016.*)       4.7.0 - 4.7.2
=20
- Calibrated MS for up to 5 Scheduling Blocks can be requested at one =
time.
- The product that we will deliver is the outcome of running =
"scriptForPI.py".
- Notification will be sent as soon as the calibrated MS is ready. =
Then you will need to download the calibrated MS in 15 days.

Subject: [REMINDER] [KVN2020B] Call for Proposals for KVN for the 2020B semester

Dear colleagues,

This is a reminder that the proposal submission deadline for the Korean
VLBI Network (KVN) is approaching to June 15, 8:00 UT. Please refer also
to the following EAVN website for more details about the array.

https://kvn.kasi.re.kr/


Best regards,

Kiyoaki Wajima
(KASI; in place of KVN director)

-----------------------------------------------
Call for Proposals 2020B (KVN VLBI)
Proposal submission deadline: 15th June, 2020, 08:00 UT
KVN website: https://kvn.kasi.re.kr/
-----------------------------------------------


The Korean VLBI Network (KVN) invites scientific proposals for VLBI observations during
the 2020B season from astronomers around the world. Observations of successful proposals
will be scheduled between 1st September 2020 and 15th January 2021. Proposals should be
submitted via the KVN website (https://kvn.kasi.re.kr/) before the deadline of UT 08:00
(KST 17:00) on 15th June 2020.


** Korean VLBI Network (KVN) **
The Korean VLBI Network (KVN) is a dedicated mm-VLBI network, operated by the Korea
Astronomy and Space Science Institute (KASI, https://www.kasi.re.kr/). Its three 21m
radio telescopes are located around South Korea in Seoul, Ulsan, and Jeju Island.
The baseline length ranges from 305km to 476 km.

The simultaneous multi-frequency (22/43/86/129 GHz) observing mode in a dual-polarization
is available. Available data rates are 1, 2, 4, and 8 Gbps. Total time of 300 hours are
planned for this call. If requested in the proposals, the observation time can be allocated
over a year, until June 15, 2021, but the observation time will not be increased. Proposers
should use the KVN VLBI observing application form and carefully follow the instructions
on the KVN website. The scientific and technical justification must be provided within
3 pages. Details of the information and current status of the KVN can be found in the KVN
status report on the KVN website (https://kvn.kasi.re.kr/). Proposals should be submitted
via the KVN website.


** Note on the EATING VLBI observations**
According to the MoA between INAF and KASI up to 30 hours of observing time in VLBI mode
are allocated to approved EATING VLBI projects. These projects have to be submitted both
to the Italian and Korean TACs with the standard form selecting "EATING VLBI" mode in the
project type. Approved projects will be observed up to 30 hours/semester. Projects exceeding
30 hours will be scheduled together with all other projects according to their relative
grades. PIs of these proposals must be associated with INAF or KASI.

____________________________________________________
Speaker:    Hsiang-Yi Karen Yang (NTHU/UMD)
Topic:         Cosmic-ray Feedback in the Universe
Time:         6/17 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:          R1203
Abstract:
Energetic feedback from stars and supermassive black holes (SMBHs) is key ingredient in the formation and evolution of galaxies and clusters, as shown by state-of-the-art cosmological simulations. However, predictive powers of these simulations are limited by the important but often neglected microphysics -- physical processes that are unresolvable and not captured by purely hydrodynamic simulations. One of such examples is cosmic rays (CRs). In this talk, I will discuss how CRs could influence feedback processes across different mass scales, including AGN feedback in galaxy clusters, Fermi bubbles within our Milky Way Galaxy, and galactic winds in dwarf galaxies. In particular, I will discuss how the detailed microscopic processes of CR transport could have dramatic impacts on the macroscopic properties of galaxies and clusters.
