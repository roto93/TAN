Speaker:    Daniel Harsono (ASIAA)
Topic:         Preparing the ingredients of planet-forming disks
Time:         7/20 (Monday) 12:15 - 13:15
Place:          R1203
Abstract:
Accretion disks are a common structure in the universe. Young stars grow by accreting the material from the disk that also forms planets. Only in recent years that it is possible to study the detailed structure of these young disks. Yet, it is still not fully understood how disks form around young protostars. By comparing the observed dust and gas structures to numerical models, it might give insights to how the material is transported from the early stages of star formation to the young planet-forming disk. In order to obtain a more complete picture, the dust, gas and ice composition of the young disk is compared with meteorites.  The history and physics of star formation can be better understood by knowing the ingredients (dust, ice and gas) of the young disk.



*** Colloquium ***

Speaker:    Ellis Owen (NTHU)
Topic:         Cosmic rays in distant galaxies: the impact of the unseen
Time:         7/22 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:          R1203
Abstract:
At high redshifts, protogalaxies were forming their first generations of stars in intense bursts. During their active phases, these starburst galaxies would presumably be environments rich in energetic cosmic rays due to the presence of massive stars and their remnants. Stellar remnants can supply seed particles and generate the shocks (via supernova explosions and other violent events) needed to accelerate the seeds to very high energies. I will present an overview of my current research activities, which consider the effects these energetic cosmic rays can have on the early Universe, particularly on the formation and evolution of the galaxies therein. I will outline how these energetic particles can interact with protogalactic environments, and discuss the impacts they may have on the evolution and star-formation histories of their hosts, how their astrophysical effects can manifest themselves on galactic, sub-galactic and super-galactic scales, and how their signatures mi!
 ght be observed in the CTA era.

Subject: Call for SMA-Taiwan Key Science Proposals

Dear Yi-Jehng,

I would appreciate it if you could circulate the â€œCall for SMA-Taiwan
Key Science Proposalsâ€￾ to TAN.

Thank you,
Naomi

---------------------------------------------------

Dear colleague,

The SMA-Taiwan (SMA-T) invites key science programs requiring substantial amount of time spreading over the multiple semesters.  The SMA-T key science project is aimed at achieving significant scientific impact using the capabilities of the SMA such as wide bandwidth and large field-of-view efficiently. The project will be conducted using the ASIAA time of the SMA, which is 13 % of the total SMA observing time. Each semester, approximately half of the ASIAA time will be allocated to the approved key science project.

Prospective PIs of the SMA-T key science projects need to submit a Notice of Intent (NoI) in advance of the submission of a full proposal. Note that the NoI needs a â€œfull-list of expected co-Isâ€￾ in order to avoid conflict of interest in seeking external reviewers.
The full proposal must be submitted by the deadline of the regular science proposals.

The deadlines for consideration in the 2020B cycle are"
Notice of Intent: 2020 Aug. 7 (Fri.) 24:00 CST
Full submission: 2020 Sep. 11 (Fri.) 4:00 CST

For detail of the SMA-T Key Science Projects, please refer to
    http://sma.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/proposal_key.php

Note that this opportunity is open to the researchers in Taiwanese institutions including ASIAA Hawaii.

Questions may be addressed to
    hirano [at] asiaa [dot] sinica [dot] edu [dot] tw.


Regards,
Naomi Hirano (on behalf of the SMA-Taiwan)
