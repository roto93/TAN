Title : Gravitational Self-force in the context of Extreme Mass Ratio
Inspirals

Abstract : When a stellar mass object is captured into an inspiral orbit
of a supermassive blackhole having mass around 10^6-10^9 M_0 then the
gravitational waves emitted are called extreme mass ratio
inspirals(EMRIs). These inspirals are slow and gradual and hence the
frequency of EMRIs ranges between 10^(-3) to 1 Hz. Since the
inspiralling object is very small compared to the central  object their
dynamics are dominated by the spacetime metric of the central blackhole
as a result the gravitational waves from EMRIs can encode the spacetime
structure of a central object with a high accuracy. In this talk, I will
discuss the properties of EMRIs and the basic concept of the
gravitational self force(GSF) in the context of EMRI waveform modeling.
