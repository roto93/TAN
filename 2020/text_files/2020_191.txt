SOKENDAI Asia Winter School 2021

The Department of Astronomical Science, SOKENDAI, invites young researchers
from Asia to join the SOKENDAI Asia Winter School 2021. The aim of the
school is to offer high-level educational experience to both undergraduate
and graduate students as well as to demonstrate the department's
cutting-edge research activities. The school consists of two parts;
intensive lecture series and hands-on sessions. The lectures cover a wide
area of astronomy and are given by world-leading researchers. The hands-on
sessions offer an opportunity for students to experience astronomy
research. This year's school is an online school. No registration fee is
needed. Interested students are encouraged to register at the website:
https://www.soken.ac.jp/event/6870/.  The registration deadline is December
25th.

Title : Gravitational Self-force in the context of Extreme Mass Ratio
Inspirals

Abstract : When a stellar mass object is captured into an inspiral orbit
of a supermassive blackhole having mass around 10^6-10^9 M_0 then the
gravitational waves emitted are called extreme mass ratio
inspirals(EMRIs). These inspirals are slow and gradual and hence the
frequency of EMRIs ranges between 10^(-3) to 1 Hz. Since the
inspiralling object is very small compared to the central  object their
dynamics are dominated by the spacetime metric of the central blackhole
as a result the gravitational waves from EMRIs can encode the spacetime
structure of a central object with a high accuracy. In this talk, I will
discuss the properties of EMRIs and the basic concept of the
gravitational self force(GSF) in the context of EMRI waveform modeling.

Title: Feature Extraction on Synthetic Black Hole Images with Neural
Networks

Abstract: The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) recently released the first
horizon-scale images of the black hole in M87. Combined with other
astronomical data, these images constrain the mass and spin of the black
hole as well as the accretion rate and magnetic flux trapped on the
black hole. An important question for EHT is how well key parameters
such as spin and trapped magnetic flux can be extracted from present and
future EHT data alone. Here we explore parameter extraction using a
neural network trained on high resolution synthetic images drawn from
state-of-the-art simulations. We find that the neural network is able to
recover spin and flux with high accuracy. We are particularly interested
in interpreting the neural network output and understanding which
features are used to identify, e.g., black hole spin. Using feature
maps, we find that the network keys on low surface brightness features
in particular.

[SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE]
The field of galaxy evolution covers a wide range of astrophysical
scales: from the cosmic large-scale structure to a central black hole of
the Milky Way Galaxy. This is a rapidly evolving field and thus it is
important to understand astrophysical processes operating on various
physical scales to draw a complete picture of the galaxy evolution.
While a workshop focused on some specific aspects of galaxies is useful,
a workshop with a broader scope essentially on everything about galaxies
is highly complementary. Motivated by this, we hold a galaxy evolution
workshop every year to improve our understanding of the complex nature
of galaxies and their evolution over time. This fiscal year in 2020,
this workshop will be virtual.

The spirit of the workshop is;
(1) to present and discuss recent (and new!) results, and
(2) to discuss what the next steps will be.
We very much appreciate presentations by young scientists. We hope this
workshop will make the galaxy community stronger on a long run.

In the past workshops, we had talks and discussions in Japanese, but we
adopted English as an official language of the last workshop, in order
to further 'educate' young people.
This fiscal year, to foster the exchange between East-Asia astronomical
community, this workshop is jointly hosted by Japan, Taiwan and Korea.
Any presentations related to galaxies (from the Milky Way to the most
distant galaxies) are welcome. In addition to general science sessions,
we have a focus session. We focus on the 'Black holes and co-evolution'.
This topic is one of the main streams of galaxy evolution science from
both theoretical and observational perspectives. We will invite a few
key people from this topic and discuss it deeply. We also welcome
oral/poster contributions about Black holes and co-evolution science. We
look forward to seeing you at the workshop!
