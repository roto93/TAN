[SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE]
The field of galaxy evolution covers a wide range of astrophysical
scales: from the cosmic large-scale structure to a central black hole of
the Milky Way Galaxy. This is a rapidly evolving field and thus it is
important to understand astrophysical processes operating on various
physical scales to draw a complete picture of the galaxy evolution.
While a workshop focused on some specific aspects of galaxies is useful,
a workshop with a broader scope essentially on everything about galaxies
is highly complementary. Motivated by this, we hold a galaxy evolution
workshop every year to improve our understanding of the complex nature
of galaxies and their evolution over time. This fiscal year in 2020,
this workshop will be virtual.

The spirit of the workshop is;
(1) to present and discuss recent (and new!) results, and
(2) to discuss what the next steps will be.
We very much appreciate presentations by young scientists. We hope this
workshop will make the galaxy community stronger on a long run.

In the past workshops, we had talks and discussions in Japanese, but we
adopted English as an official language of the last workshop, in order
to further 'educate' young people.
This fiscal year, to foster the exchange between East-Asia astronomical
community, this workshop is jointly hosted by Japan, Taiwan and Korea.
Any presentations related to galaxies (from the Milky Way to the most
distant galaxies) are welcome. In addition to general science sessions,
we have a focus session. We focus on the 'Black holes and co-evolution'.
This topic is one of the main streams of galaxy evolution science from
both theoretical and observational perspectives. We will invite a few
key people from this topic and discuss it deeply. We also welcome
oral/poster contributions about Black holes and co-evolution science. We
look forward to seeing you at the workshop!
