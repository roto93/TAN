Dear Yi-Jehng,

I would appreciate it if you could circulate the â€œCall for SMA-Taiwan
Key Science Proposalsâ€￾ to TAN.

Thank you,
Naomi

Dear colleague,

The SMA-Taiwan (SMA-T) invites key science programs requiring substantial amount of time spreading over the multiple semesters.  The SMA-T key science project is aimed at achieving significant scientific impact using the capabilities of the SMA such as wide bandwidth and large field-of-view efficiently. The project will be conducted using the ASIAA time of the SMA, which is 13 % of the total SMA observing time. Each semester, approximately half of the ASIAA time will be allocated to the approved key science project.

Prospective PIs of the SMA-T key science projects need to submit a Notice of Intent (NoI) in advance of the submission of a full proposal. The full proposal must be submitted by the deadline of the regular science proposals.

The deadlines for consideration in the 2019B cycle are"
Notice of Intent: 2020 Fwb. 14 (Fri.) 24:00 CST
Full submission:: 2020 Mar. 6 (Fri.) 5:00 CST

For detail of the SMA-T Key Science Projects, please refer to
    http://sma.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/proposal_key.php

Note that this opportunity is open to the researchers in Taiwanese institutions including ASIAA Hawaii.

Questions may be addressed to

Regards,
Naomi Hirano (on behalf of the SMA-Taiwan)
