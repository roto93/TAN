Arizona Radio Observatory: Call for Proposals (2020A)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To Astronomers and Astrophysicists of Taiwan:


The Arizona Radio Observatory (ARO) solicits observing proposals for the ALMA
Prototype 12-meter Telescope (12m) located on Kitt Peak, Arizona, and for the
10-meter Submillimeter Telescope (SMT) located on Mount Graham, Arizona, for
the period March 1, 2020 - June 15, 2020. Proposal candidates from members of
the University Consortium of ALMA-Taiwan (UCAT) and ASIAA should submit up to
THREE pages of scientific and technical justification (including figures,
tables, and references) in addition to their Proposal Summary Sheet (form here):

https://www.as.arizona.edu/sites/default/files/ARO_Proposal_Cover_Sheet.pdf


All proposal candidates are required to list on the Proposal Summary Sheet
their requested observing blocks (the exact LST ranges to be scheduled and
number of times to be repeated), dates on which they are NOT available to
observe, and dates in which sources in those observing blocks are within the
Sun-avoidance zone (45 degrees at the SMT, 10 degrees at the 12m).


The 12m ALMA Prototype antenna currently supports dual-polarization sideband-
separating (SBS) observations in three bands: 4mm (66 - 90 GHz), 3mm (84 - 116
GHz), and 1mm (211 - 275 GHz). Observations at 1mm must be clearly justified
as to why they cannot be performed on the SMT.  The 12m control system supports
dual-polarization in the same sideband or single-polarization in each sideband
("2 IF mode"; fixed 6.0 GHz IF frequency), position-switched, beam-switched,
and OTF observations. Backend modes for the AROWS spectrometer may be found on
the ARO Equipment Summary and Status sheet at:

https://www.as.arizona.edu/arizona-radio-observatory


The 10m SMT currently supports a dual-polarization sideband-separating (SBS)
observations at 1mm (211 - 280 GHz) and dual-polarization double-sideband
observations at 0.8mm (325 - 370 GHz).  The SMT is the preferred site for 1mm
observations. We note that 0.8mm weather is limited during this semester. The
SMT control system supports both dual-polarization ("2 IF mode") and dual-
polarization + dual-sideband observations ("4 IF mode") with tunable IF from
4.5 - 7.5 GHz, for position-switched, beam-switched, and OTF observations\.
Proposal candidates should consult the ARO Equipment Summary and Status sheet
for additional technical specifications:

https://www.as.arizona.edu/arizona-radio-observatory

Remote observing is available. Observers who plan to observe remotely must
supply fixed IP address(es) of the computer(s) that will be used during
observing on their Proposal Summary Sheet. For further information about
remote observing and other operational questions, please contact the ARO
Software Engineers: Tom Folkers:

tfolkers@email.arizona.edu or Natalie Gandilo ngandilo@email.arizona.edu


Scheduling of successful proposals will be done according to availability of
the receivers requested.  Graduate student participation is especially
encouraged.

Projects which require long telescope time, e.g.  > 24 hrs, are possible based
on scientific merit.  Proposals should be emailed in PDF format to
kuan[at]asiaa.sinica.edu.tw by midnight (23:59 CST) on February 26, 2020
(Wednesday).

Speaker:    Seongjoong Kim (Tokyo Institute of Technology)
Topic:         Deriving the dust properties in the TW Hya disks with the synthetic ALMA
multiband analysis
Time:         2/18 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:          R1203
Abstract:
The multiwavelength analysis is one of the useful tools to understand the dust properties in protoplanetary disks. I study the synthetic ALMA multiband analysis to find the best three ALMA band combination for deriving the accurate dust temperature Tdust, optical depth Ï„Î½, and dust opacity power-law index Î² (ÎºÎ½ âˆ￾ Î½^Î²) using the ALMA archival data of the TW Hya disk. Through this approach, I can directly derive the three unknowns (Tdust, Ï„Î½, Î²) without any assumptions on some of the dust properties. The synthetic multiband analysis results show that the Band [10,6,3] set is the best combination for minimizing the uncertainties of the dust properties derived from ALMA observations. The band combinations with Band 9 or 10 and with the large frequency intervals between the bands in the set give us stronger
constraints on the dust properties. Also, large Î² and low Tdust are preferable for reducing the uncertainties of the dust properties. Some of those conditions are interpreted that the combination of optically thick and thin bands are required for obtaining stronger constraints on the dust properties. To examine the consistency of the synthetic analysis results, I apply the multiband analysis to ALMA archival data of the TW Hya disk at Band 4, 6, 7, and 9. I confirm that the trend of the synthetic model is consistent with the derivations from the real data. Additionally, I examine my synthetic analysis results with ALMA Band 1 which has been developing in ASIAA. The results show that the ALMA band combinations with Band 1 will improve the constraints on the dust properties.
