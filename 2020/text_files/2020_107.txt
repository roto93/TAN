ALMA-Taiwan Users Survey

Dear colleagues,

The ALMA Regional Center (ARC) in Taiwan organizes User workshops to advertise relevant information about the ALMA Call for proposals, new capabilities, Observatory news, etc.

In the interest of the Taiwan-based community, we have discussed topics and format for future ALMA workshops. If you are interested, please access and fill in the survey, where you can see relevant info about upcoming and planned events.

We will send additional information in the coming weeks. Please send us your feedback within 1 or 1.5 weeks. This short survey will take you between 5 to 10 mins to complete.

Arizona Radio Observatory: Call for Proposals (2020B)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To Astronomers and Astrophysicists of Taiwan,

The Arizona Radio Observatory (ARO) solicits observing proposals for the
10-meter Submillimeter Telescope (SMT) located on Mount Graham, Arizona, for
the period October 15, 2020 - February 15, 2021. No new proposals for the ALMA
Prototype 12-meter Telescope (12m) located on Kitt Peak, Arizona will be
accepted for this current call as proposals from the 2020A call for proposals
will be carried over to the 2020B proposal period. Proposal candidates from
members of the University Consortium of ALMA-Taiwan (UCAT) and ASIAA should
submit up to THREE pages of scientific and technical justification (including
figures, tables, and references) in addition to their Proposal Summary Sheet
(download form here):
https://www.as.arizona.edu/sites/default/files/ARO_Proposal_Cover_Sheet.pdf

All proposal candidates are required to list on the Proposal Summary Sheet
their requested observing blocks (the exact LST ranges to be scheduled and
number of times to be repeated), dates on which they are NOT available to
observe, and dates in which sources in those observing blocks are within the
Sun-avoidance zone (45 degrees at the SMT, 10 degrees at the 12m).

The 10m SMT currently supports dual-polarization sideband-separating (SBS)
observations at 1mm (211-280 GHz) and dual-polarization double-sideband
observations at 0.8mm (325-370 GHz). The SMT control system supports both
dual-polarization ("2 IF mode") and dual-polarization + dual-sideband
observations ("4 IF mode") with tunable IF from 4.5-7.5 GHz, for position-
switched, beam-switched, and OTF observations.  Proposal candidates should
consult the ARO Equipment Summary and Status sheet for additional technical
specifications:
https://www.as.arizona.edu/arizona-radio-observatory

Remote observing is available. Observers who plan to observe remotely must
supply fixed IP address(es) of the computer(s) that will be used during
observing on their Proposal Summary Sheet. For further information about
remote observing and other operational questions, please contact the ARO
Software Engineer Natalie Gandilo ngandilo@email.arizona.edu

Scheduling of successful proposals will be done according to availability of
the receivers requested. Based on scientific merit, projects which request
observing time longer than 24 hours will be considered. Graduate student
participation is especially encouraged. Proposals should be emailed as a
single file in PDF format to kuan[at]asiaa.sinica.edu.tw by 23:59 CST on
August 27, 2020 (Thursday).

Subject: [CAG seminar] 30/Jul/2020

Dear all,

Next Thursday we will have Pin-Gao from ASIAA as our seminar speaker.
Pin-Gao works on a wide spectrum of astrophysical topics. He will share
with us his recent discoveries of the close relationships between stars
and planets.

Best,
Yueh-Ning

Speaker: Pin-Gao Gu (Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Academia
Sinica)
Time: 16:30, 30/Jul/2020
Venue: S101

Title: My recent journey from star-forming regions to planetary systems
Abstract:
I will talk about my "journey" from star-forming clouds, protoplanetary
disks, chaotic planet-forming regions, hot Jupiters, and finally back to
the Solar System based on the stories in my very recent works. Through
this journey, the audience will enjoy the power of interstellar shocks,
potential young planets embedded in disks, violent giant impacts among
planets, anomalously bloated exoplanets, and even the hot debris just
hidden in the glory of the solar corona that we see during a solar
eclipse!
