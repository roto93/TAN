Release of Full Polarization ALMA Test Data
Oct 01, 2020
https://almascience.nao.ac.jp/news/release-of-full-polarization-alma-test-data

On 1 October ALMA has released data acquired as part of the Extension and Optimization of Capabilities effort (EOC). The data were used to test, implement, and determine the accuracy of the linear-polarization mosaicking observing mode of ALMA. The data consist of:

(1) Offset-pointing full-polarization observations performed in an 11x11 pointing grid in the (Azimuth, Elevation) frame, covering a region spanning approximately the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the primary beam at bands 3, 5, 6, and 7. The observations were of the bright, highly linearly polarized quasar 3C 279.

(2) A 15 and 45-pointing mosaic in band 3 and band 6, respectively, toward the Orion-KL nebula. The observations were configured as rectangular mosaics with a factor of 2 over-sampling (with respect to Nyquist) along both axes, or a factor of 4 in total beam overlap. Both mosaics are centered at RA = 05:35:14.5, DEC = -05:22:31.6 (J2000), using the standard spectral specification for continuum polarization observations with ALMA. The mosaics were oriented at approximately 30 degrees E of N, with an approximate extension of 90 arcsec in width and 130 arcsec in length for band 3, and 54 arcsec in width and 82 arcsec in length for band 6. The approximate angular resolution of the data is 0.9 arcsec in band 3 and 0.6 arcsec in band 6. The approximate achieved sensitivity is 0.9, 0.1, and 0.1 mJy/beam for Stokes I, Q, and U, respectively, in band 3 and 2.1, 0.5, and 0.49 mJy/beam for Stokes I, Q, and U, respectively, in band 6.

Note that the theoretical sensitivity was not reached for the Stokes I Orion-KL data as the image was dynamic range limited. The raw data, along with the calibrated measurement sets, reference images, and reduction scripts are included in the release.

The data are available here (please refer to the readme file at each of these locations for information on the content of the files):
- 3C279 data (https://alma-dl.mtk.nao.ac.jp/ftp/alma/sciver/3C279-11x11/)
- OrionKL data (https://alma-dl.mtk.nao.ac.jp/ftp/alma/sciver/OrionKL-Pol/)

Speaker:    Natsuko Izumi (ASIAA)
Topic:         Core mass function in low-metallicity environment
Time:         10/12 (Monday) 12:15 - 13:15
Place:          R1203
Abstract:
Understanding the origin of stellar initial mass function (IMF) is a central issue in the study of star formation. The past studies of dense cores reported that the slope of the stellar IMF and core mass function (CMF) are consistent, suggesting that the fundamental mass distribution of stars is determined during the early stage of the core formation. However, dense cores have been observed and studied only in the inner part of the Galactic plane (including the solar neighborhood), which has similar metallicity to that of the solar neighborhood. Thus, an important question to address is whether the same relation between the CMF and stellar IMF holds true even in low-metallicity environments. To solve this question, we performed CO and dust continuum ALMA high-resolution (~0.1 pc scale) mapping observation toward a massive star-forming molecular cloud in the outer Galaxy, which has much lower gas density and lower metallicity (~20 % of the solar neighborhood value) than those!
   in the solar neighborhood . As the results, we successfully detected ~0.1 pc-wide filament structures and ~0.1 pc-scale dense core structures in the outer Galaxy for the first time. We also found that the slope of the CMF in the outer Galaxy is similar to that of the universal IMF. These results suggest that the star-formation processes in the low-metallicity environment follow a universal law.

Please help forward the following message about a high-energy astrophysics
winter school at NTHU during the winter break.

*****************************

*NTHU/NCTS Astronomy Winter School: High-Energy Astrophysics*
Jan 18th =E2=80=93 22nd
*Online, and NCTS, Hsinchu*

We are pleased to announce the NTHU/NCTS Winter School on High-Energy
Astrophysics, to be held both online and at the National Center for
Theoretical Science, Hsinchu, Taiwan, January 18th =E2=80=93 22nd, 2021.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Registration is now open. Please complete registration here:
http://phys.cts.nthu.edu.tw/actnews/intro.php?Sn=3D505&OSn=3D1349
You can indicate whether you will attend on-site or remotely.
*Registration deadline: 20th December 2020.*
------------------------------------------------------------------------
We cordially invite your participation.
The purpose of this winter school is to present an overview of the progress
in major areas of cosmic ray astrophysics and gamma-ray astronomy in recent
years, and to provide an introduction to the essential physics and
concepts. It will also be an opportunity to bring together both new and
established researchers in the field for discussion and exchange of ideas\.
The programme will cover a broad range of topics within cosmic ray
astrophysics and gamma-ray astronomy, ranging from theory/modelling &
simulation to instrumentation & observation.

The school is intended for graduate research (PhD and Masters) students and
post-docs with an interest in becoming involved in high energy astrophysics
(in particular, topics relating to cosmic rays and gamma-rays), as well as
early-career scientists already active in the field looking to broaden
their understanding. It will comprise of a keynote lecture and six primary
lecture series from international experts, plus five highlight science
talks to complement the programme. The keynote lecture will be given by
Prof Werner Hofmann (Max-Planck-Institut f=C3=BCr Kernphysik, Heidelberg,
Germany).

There is one more talk at colloquium next week. Sorry for the late notice.=

NEXT Colloquium: 2020-10-14 Wed 14:20~15:20 [R1203]
Speaker:    Aniket Agrawal
Topic:    Probing the early Universe with gravitational waves
Abstract:    Observations of the cosmic microwave background over the last two=
 decades hint that all structure in our Universe, including us, arose from =
quantum fluctuations at its birth. One key piece in confirming this picture=
, however, remains missing. In this talk, I will describe how observations =
of gravitational waves from the very beginning of our Universe can provide =
this missing piece. I will also talk about how we can use these primordial =
gravitational waves to probe the constituents of our Universe at its moment=
 of birth, and how they might provide possibly the only evidence for quantu=
m gravity.
