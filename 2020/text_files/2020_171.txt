Dear All,

We will again have SMA school next spring.
This time, it will be a remote virtual school.
This means that you won't need to travel.
Please mark your calendar and wait for the
2nd announcement if you are interested in
this school.

Cheers,
Wei-Hao

Hi Wei-Hao,

Please would you be able to circulate this announcements for the SMA School to the ASIAA mailing list?

Thank you very much!

Dear Colleagues,

We are delighted to be releasing this First Announcement for the 2021 Submillimeter Array Interferometry School.

The school will be held virtually between March 14-19th 2021, and is organized by the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian, in conjunction with the Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA) and the University of Hawaii. The goals of the school are to provide graduate students, postdocs and scientists with a broad knowledge of interferometry and data reduction techniques at (sub)millimeter wavelengths.

The workshop will provide a series of online lectures on the fundamentals of radio interferometry with a special emphasis on observations at (sub)millimeter wavelengths along with data reduction tutorials with SMA observations. The school will extensively utilize the Submillimeter Array (SMA) on Mauna Kea, Hawaii and its new capabilities. Multiple sessions will be organized daily to accommodate participants from all time zones. We particularly stress the interactive nature of this School, where participants will be able to experience real-time data reduction for their own proposed projects. Further information can be found on the school website https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/sma-school/.

A second announcement will contain more details regarding the logistics of this virtual school, including the opening of registration in November. Questions can be sent to the School's email at sma-school@cfa.harvard.edu. Stay tuned and, for now, save the date!

The Organizing Committee

Subject: [CAG seminar] 2020 Nov. 06 12:20 B101

Dear all,=20

Next Friday (Nov 06) our CAG seminar will focus on observations of
stellar flares. Li-Ching Huang will talk to us about possible
implications of flare activities on binary stars or on exoplanets.=20

Speaker: Li-Ching Huang (=E9=BB=83=E7=AB=8B=E6=99=B4 NCU)
Time: 12:20 pm, 2020 Nov 06
Venue: B101=20

Title: Flare Activity of Eclipsing Binary and Exoplanet Systems=20

Abstract: Flare activity is an important phenomena caused by the
chromosphere activity in late-type stars. We collected the light curve
data from Kepler telescope and spectral data from ground-based
telescopes for detecting flare events and measuring the chromospheric
active levels of late-type stars with exoplanets or in binary systems.
Our result agrees with the previous studies that slow rotators are less
active than fast rotators and the stars with exoplanets tend to have
less flare activity and lower chromospheric activity levels. M-type
eclipsing binaries (EBs) show less flare events with large flares
(energy release 10^34 ergs) than the hyperflaring M dwarfs, but their
cumulative flare frequency factor is 10 times higher than the flaring
single M dwarfs. The flare timing also shows that the secondary stars
might be the major flare producers in some EB systems. Flare activity is
also important to the habitability of the exoplanets. Stars with less
frequent superflares provide better environments for life development,
especially for the M-type stars, whose longevity and abundance make them
good environments for habitable exoplanets. Kepler-442 is a K-type
main-sequence star with an earth size exoplanet (2.3 M_earth) in the
habitable zone. Flare events are detected on this star, which is
different from our result that exoplanet systems rarely show flare
activity.
