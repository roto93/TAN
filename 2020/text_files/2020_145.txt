Subject: [EAVN2021A] Call for Proposals for the East Asian VLBI Network (EAVN)
 for the 2021A semester
Date: Fri, 18 Sep 2020 08:57:31 +0000

Dear colleagues,

This e-mail is to announce 'Call for Proposals (CfP) for the East Asian VLBI
Network (EAVN)' for the 2021A semester. Please refer to the following EAVN
website for more details about the array's specification, available observation
modes, and how to submit proposals.

https://eavn.kasi.re.kr/


Best regards,

Kiyoaki Wajima
(KASI; in place of EAVN directors)

-----------------------------------------------------

***************************************************
Call for Proposals for the East Asian VLBI Network (EAVN) for the 2021A semester
Proposal submission deadline: 2020 November 2 (Mon.), 8:00 UT
EAVN website: https://eavn.kasi.re.kr/
***************************************************

--- Major revisions from the 2020B semester ---
* EAVN will be operated using 14 telescopes (VERA, KVN, Tianma, Sheshan, Nanshan,
  Nobeyama, Takahagi, Hitachi, and Yamaguchi). Availability of VERA's antenna
  will depend on the financial situation in the fiscal year 2021.
* C-band (6.7 GHz) observation mode is newly opened.
-----------------------------------------------


*** Overview ***
We invite proposals for open-use observations with the East Asian VLBI Network
(EAVN), which is the international collaborative VLBI array between China,
Korea, and Japan. In the 2021A semester, 14 telescopes (VERA 4 x 20 m, KVN
3 x 21 m, Tianma 65 m, Sheshan 25 m, Nanshan 26 m, Nobeyama 45 m, Takahagi 32 m,
Hitach 32 m, and Yamaguchi 32 m) participate in the EAVN open-use program.


*** Observing mode ***
EAVN provides an opportunity of a VLBI observation with a data recording rate
of 1 Gbps (total bandwidth of 256 MHz and with single polarization at 6.7, 22,
and 43 GHz. Dual-frequency (22 and 43 GHz) simultaneous observation system
can be used for EAVN observations at KaVA and Nobeyama, while the session
will be set in which the system is available. Details of available observing
mode can be found in the EAVN Status Report on the EAVN website.


*** Telescope time and array configuration ***
The total available observation time for EAVN is up to 500 hours in the 2021A
semester, while the available observing time for individual EAVN telescopes are
different. All EAVN observations will be allocated between 2021 January 16 and
June 15. Please refer to the EAVN status report on the EAVN website for more
details.

EAVN accepts a request for usage of sub-array configuration (KaVA 7 telescopes
and additional telescopes from non-KaVA stations). There are several conditions
of the antenna combination depending on the observing frequency. Further details
about the sub-array configuration are shown in the EAVN status report.

The maximum request time for a single EAVN proposal is limited to 100 hours
in case of usage of only KaVA, while one can request for the maximum total
observation time of 36 hours for non-KaVA telescopes (except Nobeyama) for a
single proposal, and that of 24 hours for Nobeyama. Proposers can request
their project to be allocated over a year until the end of the 2021B semester
(2022 January 15), while the total request time of the proposal is still limited
as shown above.


*** Target of opportunity ***
EAVN accepts target of opportunity (ToO) proposals. Note that Nobeyama cannot
be included for ToO proposals. It is strongly recommended that ToO proposals
(especially expected ToO) are submitted during the regular CfP, while unexpected
or urgent ToO can be submitted as Director's Discretionary Time (DDT) proposals
at any time. ToO proposals must include clear triggering criteria to initiate
an observation. ToOs are valid for one year after it is approved. ToO proposals
for DDT should follow the same way of regular call and should be submitted via
the EAVN website.


*** Proposal submission ***
Proposals should be submitted via EAVN website. Proposal submission deadline
is 2020 November 2 (Mon.), 8:00 UT. Please refer to the EAVN status report for
detailed information about the proposal format. The designated cover sheet
form can be downloaded from the EAVN websites.


*** Acknowledgment ***
All EAVN users are asked to specify the acknowledgment to EAVN in their
publications. A template for the acknowledgment can be found in the EAVN
status report.


Sincerely,

Mareki Honma
Director of Mizusawa VLBI Observatory, NAOJ
