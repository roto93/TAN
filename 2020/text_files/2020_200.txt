Topic:         The birth and the fate of close and wide binaries
Time:         12/21 (Monday) 12:15 - 13:15
Place:          R1203
Abstract:
Since a significant fraction of stars are in multiple systems, binaries are now a critical component in modern astronomy. Close binaries are the origin of many exotic astronomical events in the Universe, including stellar mergers, type Ia supernovae, and gravitational wave events. On the other extreme, wide binaries are easily disrupted by gravitational perturbations, making them a unique tool to probe the Galactic structures. However, the formation and evolution of close and wide binaries remain an unsolved problem, especially because the age of binaries is difficult to measure. In this talk, I will show how we can learn about the age evolution of close and wide binaries from the Galactic kinematics using the Gaia data. For main-sequence contact binaries, I will discuss when and how they are born and when they merge. By combining Gaia with LAMOST, I will show that the wide binary fraction strongly depends on the metallicity, shedding light on their formation processes. In t!
 he end, I will demonstrate how these binaries can help us to understand the mass-radius relation of white dwarfs and planet formation.

Topic:         Feature Extraction on Synthetic Black Hole Images with Neural Networks
Time:         12/23 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:          R1203
Abstract:
The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) recently released the first horizon-scale images of the black hole in M87. Combined with other astronomical data, these images constrain the mass and spin of the black hole as well as the accretion rate and magnetic flux trapped on the black hole. An important question for EHT is how well key parameters such as spin and trapped magnetic flux can be extracted from present and future EHT data alone. Here we explore parameter extraction using a neural network trained on high resolution synthetic images drawn from state-of-the-art simulations. We find that the neural network is able to recover spin and flux with high accuracy. We are particularly interested in interpreting the neural network output and understanding which features are used to identify, e.g., black hole spin. Using feature maps, we find that the network keys on low surface brightness features in particular.

Topic:         Estimating Cluster Mass from SDSS Broad-band Images by Deep Learning
Time:         12/24 (Thursday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:          R1203
Abstract:
The cluster mass is one of the fundamental properties of galaxy clusters. In optical surveys, several measures can be taken to estimate the cluster mass, including, for example, utilizing the velocity dispersion of the cluster galaxies, or the weak gravitational lensing. On the other hand, deep learning provides an unique way to predict the cluster mass by approximating the underlying complicated mappings from inputs (images or catalogs) to outputs. In this talk, I will present a semi-supervised machine learning model which estimates the cluster mass directly from the SDSS ugriz-band images. I will also show the visualization of the model which can be used to interpret the network output.
