East Asian ALMA Science Workshop 2021

Dear Colleague,

It is our pleasure to announce the East Asian ALMA Science Workshop
2021, hosted by KASI (Korea). Please refer to the details given below.
The registration is open now.

Yours truly,
The SOC

** Details **

Time: 2021 February 17 (Wed) - 19 (Fri)
Place: Online
Host organization: KASI, Daejeon, Korea
Website: http://alma.kasi.re.kr/almakasi2021/

** Rationale **

The East Asian ALMA Science Workshop, held annually, serves as a forum
to exchange and discuss many new and exciting scientific results
obtained with ALMA as well as new ideas for future projects and new
proposals for the upcoming cycle 8. The 2021 workshop will be hosted by
KASI in Korea. We invite all colleagues affiliated with the East Asian
ALMA community to participate and to share their work.

Due to the travel restrictions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the
workshop will be fully online. Nevertheless, local meetings of the
various national communities may be organized by local host institutes.

We plan to accommodate most, if not all, presentations in the form of
talks. Depending on the number of abstracts we receive, we may have to
relegate some presentations to a dedicated poster session when
finalizing the program.

Abstract deadline: 2021 Jan 5 (Tue)
