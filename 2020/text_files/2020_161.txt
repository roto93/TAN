Title: Influence of Large Stellar Flares on Rocky Exoplanets=20

Abstract: Planets orbiting low-mass stars are prime systems for
atmospheric characterization due to their low star-to-planet brightness
contrast, high transit frequency, and prolonged main sequence stellar
lifetimes. However, small stars such as M-dwarfs are highly magnetically
active stemming from strong interactions between the stellar photosphere
and corona. As a result, the atmospheres of attendant rocky planets in
these systems may suffer severe atmospheric escape and chemical
modulations by strong X-ray and UV activity. Previous 1D models found
that although a single large flare does not substantially impact the
ozone layers, repeated secular flaring with the inclusion of highly
energetic particles could rapidly destroy the ozone columns of planets
with initially Earth-like atmospheres.=20

In this talk, I present our results in studying the effects of repeated
stellar flares on planets orbiting G-, K-, and M-stars using
state-of-the-art 3D models. First, I will briefly present key
conclusions from my previous work simulating the atmospheres of rocky
planets. Second, I will describe our methodology of this study by
coupling an M-dwarf flare model to the 3D atmosphere model.
Specifically, I will discuss how we compute realistic flare intensities,
frequencies, and durations with a flare toolkit with data drawn from
Hubble Space Telescope observational campaigns. I will then present new
results in that we find that recurring stellar flares drive planetary
atmospheres around K- and M-dwarfs into new chemical equilibria that
substantially deviate from their initial pre-flare regimes. This stems
from increased M-dwarf proton fluences, changes in the latitudinal
extensions of energetic particle deposition due to absence of planetary
magnetic fields, and transport via large-scale circulation and wave
breaking. Using a newly published radiative transfer model, I will show
that chemical compounds such as nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric acid
(HNO3) can be prominently observed throughout the entirety of the
planet's orbit in active stellar systems, making these "beacons of life"
highly amenable to detection by the James Webb Space Telescope and
next-generation instruments.

Topic:         PHANGS and its view of gas and star formation distributions in nearby galaxies
Time:         10/21 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:          R1203
Abstract:
Star formation in galaxies is determined by the efficiency of the conversion of gas to stars and stellar feedback that shapes the reservoir of gas for future star formation. In this talk, I will introduce the PHANGS survey (Physics at High ANgular resolution in Nearby GalaxieS), a large multi-wavelength project to survey nearby galaxies at ~100-pc scale in molecular gas, star-forming regions, and stellar clusters, aiming to study the link between the small-scale physics of gas and star formation and galaxy properties and  evolution.

I will also show you the preliminary results that probe the global property dependency of the relative distribution of molecular gas and star formation in nearby galaxies. We employ a simple approach to quantify the distributions of regions with different evolutionary stages of star formation: from quiescent molecular gas, to star-forming gas, and to regions of massive star formation only. At the best-match resolution of 150 pc, the distribution of regions with different evolutionary stages show a dependence on the stellar mass and morphology of galaxies, both globally and locally. Galactic dynamics (e.g., bar and spiral arms) also add to the complexity of the star formation process. Our results highlight the potential importance of galaxy properties for the gas-star formation cycle, and imply a global-property-dependent Kennicuttâ€“Schmidt relation. However, any trends between galaxy properties and molecular gas and HII region distributions is visible only when the observed!
  spatial scale is smaller than ~500 pc, indicating a critical resolution requirement to resolve the dependency.

AS/NTU Joint Colloquium: 2020-10-20 Tue 14:20~15:20 [CCMS R104]
Speaker:    You-Hua Chu
Topic:    CSI: Type Ia Supernova Remnant in Taiwan
Abstract:    Searching for clues on supernovae (SNe) from their supernova remn=
ants (SNRs) is like a crime scene investigation (CSI). This talk is based o=
n Type Ia SNR work by my students and postdoc in Taiwan. Type Ia SNe have b=
een used as standardizable candles to discover the accelerated expansion of=
 the Universe; however, we still are not certain how Type Ia SNe exploded e=
xactly. Two popular scenarios have been suggested, one involves a white dwa=
rf (WD) having accreted too much material from a normal-star companion, and=
 the other involves merger of two WDs. In the former scenario, the stellar =
companion survives the SN explosion, while in the latter scenario no stella=
r remnant is left. We have been studying the Type Ia SNRs in our neighborin=
g galaxy the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), using Hubble Space Telescope ima=
ges to search for surviving companions of their SN progenitors and dense ci=
rcumstellar material ejected by the SN progenitors. I will report our findi=
ngs and suggest possible explosion mechanisms. I will also report on our se=
arch for young Type Ia SNRs in the M33 galaxy. The goal of this research is=
 to understand the explosion mechanisms of Type Ia SNe.
