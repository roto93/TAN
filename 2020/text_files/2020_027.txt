Dear Colleagues,

Because of the recent outbreak of the coronavirus in China, the SOC decided
to extend the deadline for registration and abstract submission of 2020
East Asian Young Astronomer=E2=80=99s meeting (EAYAM) to Apr 15th 2020. The=
 SOC
will keep a close attention to the epidemic situation and keep you updated
if the schedule of EAYAM is further changed.

Best Regards,
Hsi-Wei Yen
on behalf of the SOC

Speaker:    Teppei Okumura (ASIAA)
Topic:         Intrinsic alignment of galaxy shapes as new dynamic and geometric probes of cosmology
Time:         2/24 (Monday) 12:15 - 13:15
Place:          R1203
Abstract:
Intrinsic alignments (IAs), correlations of galaxy orientations/shapes with surrounding fields such as the mass overdensity, arise due to physical processes during the formation and evolution of galaxies. Thus, investigating IAs in principle enables one to probe galaxy formation and evolution. IAs have been extensively studied also in the context of potential systematic effects in weak-lensing surveys. Besides the two effects above, there is a growing interest of using the galaxy IAs as a tool to extract cosmological information complimentary to galaxy clustering analysis. In a series of recent papers I have developed a comprehensive framework for this purpose: formulation of the IA statistics, investigation of the cosmological information encoded in the IAs, and a forecast study which shows that constraints on cosmological parameters such as dark energy and Hubble parameter can be tighter than those from conventional galaxy clustering analysis alone by a factor of more than!
  1.5. In this lunch talk I will present a brief overview of these series of work.

Speaker:    Takuya Inoue (Doshisha University)
Topic:         The effect of our local motion on the Sandage-Loeb test of the cosmic expansion
Time:         2/25 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:          R1203
Abstract:
Redshifts of an astronomical body measured at multiple epochs (e.g., separated by 10 years) are different due to the cosmic expansion. This so-called Sandage-Loeb test offers a direct measurement of the expansion rate of the Universe. However, acceleration in the motion of Solar System with respect to the cosmic microwave background also changes redshifts measured at multiple epochs. If not accounted for, it yields a biased cosmological inference. To address this, we calculate the acceleration of Solar System with respect to the Local Group of galaxies to quantify the change in the measured redshift due to local motion. Our study is motivated by the recent determination of the mass of Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), which indicates a significant fraction of the Milky Way mass. We find that the acceleration towards the Galactic Center dominates, which gives a redshift change of 7 cm/s in 10 years, while the accelerations due to LMC and M31 cannot be ignored depending on lines o!
 f sight. We create all-sky maps of the expected change in redshift and the corresponding uncertainty, which can be used to correct for this effect.
