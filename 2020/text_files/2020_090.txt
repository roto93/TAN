Call for Proposals 2020B (KVN VLBI)
Proposal submission deadline: 15th June, 2020, 08:00 UT
KVN website: https://kvn.kasi.re.kr/
-----------------------------------------------


The Korean VLBI Network (KVN) invites scientific proposals for VLBI observations during
the 2020B season from astronomers around the world. Observations of successful proposals
will be scheduled between 1st September 2020 and 15th January 2021. Proposals should be
submitted via the KVN website (https://kvn.kasi.re.kr/) before the deadline of UT 08:00
(KST 17:00) on 15th June 2020.


** Korean VLBI Network (KVN) **
The Korean VLBI Network (KVN) is a dedicated mm-VLBI network, operated by the Korea
Astronomy and Space Science Institute (KASI, https://www.kasi.re.kr/). Its three 21m
radio telescopes are located around South Korea in Seoul, Ulsan, and Jeju Island.
The baseline length ranges from 305km to 476 km.

The simultaneous multi-frequency (22/43/86/129 GHz) observing mode in a dual-polarization
is available. Available data rates are 1, 2, 4, and 8 Gbps. Total time of 300 hours are
planned for this call. If requested in the proposals, the observation time can be allocated
over a year, until June 15, 2021, but the observation time will not be increased. Proposers
should use the KVN VLBI observing application form and carefully follow the instructions
on the KVN website. The scientific and technical justification must be provided within
3 pages. Details of the information and current status of the KVN can be found in the KVN
status report on the KVN website (https://kvn.kasi.re.kr/). Proposals should be submitted
via the KVN website.


** Note on the EATING VLBI observations**
According to the MoA between INAF and KASI up to 30 hours of observing time in VLBI mode
are allocated to approved EATING VLBI projects. These projects have to be submitted both
to the Italian and Korean TACs with the standard form selecting "EATING VLBI" mode in the
project type. Approved projects will be observed up to 30 hours/semester. Projects exceeding
30 hours will be scheduled together with all other projects according to their relative
grades. PIs of these proposals must be associated with INAF or KASI.
