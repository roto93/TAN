*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________
Speaker:    Ya-Hui Yang (NCU)
Topic:         Hard X-ray and Radio Signatures Associated with Intense Solar Flares
Time:         8/19 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:          R1203
Abstract:
Solar flare is one of the most explosive phenomena in the solar system that large amount of energy (1032~1033 ergs) releases within 102-103 seconds, which can accelerate electrons up to few hundreds of MeV and ions up to several tens of GeV. One of the most important issues in solar physics is to investigate the energy release and particle acceleration processes. The flare-accelerated particles generated in the corona can propagate upward along the open magnetic fields into the interplanetary space and move along the closed magnetic fields downward to the lower solar atmosphere. In general, the chromospheric hard X-ray sources occur in the impulsive phase of solar flares and are thought to be the footpoints of newly reconnected magnetic fields mapped to the primary energy release site. The radio emissions are the important diagnostic tool to trace and study the dynamics of flare-accelerated particles. In this talk, I will first introduce the solar flare characteristics in mu!
 lti-wavelength observations. Then I will present the research works on the estimation of reconnection electric field, asymmetry of chromospheric hard X-ray emissions, fine structures seen in a radio dynamic spectrogram, as well as the pre-flare Type III radio bursts and their solar associations.
