*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________
Speaker:    Po-Yu Chang (National Cheng Kung University, Institute of Space and Plasma Sciences)
Topic:         Studies of high-energy-density plasma (HEDP) on a 1-kJ pulsed-power system
Time:         2/12 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:          R1203
Abstract:
A 1 kJ pulsed-power system was built for studying various topics related to high-energy-density plasma, a regime with pressure greater than 1 MBar in general. Astrophysics and space sciences can be studied experimentally using the pulsed-power system due to the magnetohydrodynamic scaling. The pulsed-power system consists of twenty 1 Î¼F capacitors, two rail-gap switches, two parallel plate transmission lines, and a cylindrical vacuum chamber orientated vertically. Two capacitors are first connected in series forming a brick. Five bricks are connected in parallel forming a wing. Finally, two wings are connected in parallel forming the whole capacitor bank, i.e., 5 Î¼F in total. The system is charged to 20 kV. When it is discharged, a peak current of 110Â±20 kA with a rise time of 1.51Â±0.06 Î¼s, i.e., a power of âˆ¼ 700 MW, is provided. It is the pulsed current that will be used to drive different loads for different experiments. In particular but not restricted, supersonic !
 plasma jets are generated via imploding conical-wire arrays made of tungsten wires using the pulsed-power system. The supersonic plasma jets will be used to simulate solar winds in the laboratory. When the generated supersonic plasma jet flows around an obstacle with or without surrounding plasma, either the Martian bow shock or wake cavity behind the moon will be studied based on the hydrodynamic similarity between the solar system and the laboratory. Besides generating plasma jets using conical-wire arrays, we are also developing a new scheme of generating plasma jets by compressing argon plasma plume, which will be generated by a plasma gun, using conical-theta pinches. Therefore, experiments can be conducted with higher repetition rates. To diagnose different experiments, a suite of ultrafast x-ray imaging systems such as time-integrated pinhole camera with an exposure time of 1 Î¼s, a streak camera with a temporal resolution of 15 ps, and a framing camera with a tempor!
 al resolution of ns are being built by ourselves. Interferomet!
 ry using a q-switch laser with the single longitudinal mode is planned to be used for plasma density measurements. Collective thomson scattering will be used for measuring local electron temperatures, ion temperatures, electron densities, and ion densities of the plasma. The laser pulse will be compressed using stimulated brillouin scattering (SBS) in water so that a temporal resolution of sub- ns can be achieved. Although all diagnostics are being developed, we have started imploding conical-wire arrays. Time-integrated images in visible light will be shown. This work was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), Taiwan, under Award Number 105-2112-M-006-014-MY3.
