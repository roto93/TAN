IMPORTANT NOTE on the 2020 program

According to recently revised university calendar (the semester and the summer vacation schedule) in Taiwan following the government's Coronavirus disease protection measure, we have revised our summer student program period to be 7/13-8/28. This year the program is only 1.5 month-long (our regular program is 2 month-long).

Given the Coronavirus outbreak, there are travel/visiting regulations/restrictions imposed by the government(s) on both ends and by our institution. (Note that the visa application is usually made at early May). If the local situation around ASIAA becomes very bad, we might need to cancel the entire summer student program even after confirming the students. The situation has been very dynamic and these regulations may change rapidly. The applicants need to understand the risk of their admission getting canceled or travel getting restricted due to unforeseen and unfortunate conditions.

Below you can find the latest information about the conditions in Taiwan and the government regulations from Taiwan Centers for Disease Control and Ministry of the Interior, National Immigration Agency of Taiwan.
