Dear all,

Next Friday (Dec 18) our CAG seminar will be given by Joshua Yao-Yu Lin.
He will share with us how to apply machine learning technique to black
hole imaging. If you wish to order lunchbox, please reserve [1] before
Thursday noon.

Title: Feature Extraction on Synthetic Black Hole Images with Neural
Networks

Abstract: The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) recently released the first
horizon-scale images of the black hole in M87. Combined with other
astronomical data, these images constrain the mass and spin of the black
hole as well as the accretion rate and magnetic flux trapped on the
black hole. An important question for EHT is how well key parameters
such as spin and trapped magnetic flux can be extracted from present and
future EHT data alone. Here we explore parameter extraction using a
neural network trained on high resolution synthetic images drawn from
state-of-the-art simulations. We find that the neural network is able to
recover spin and flux with high accuracy. We are particularly interested
in interpreting the neural network output and understanding which
features are used to identify, e.g., black hole spin. Using feature
maps, we find that the network keys on low surface brightness features
in particular.
