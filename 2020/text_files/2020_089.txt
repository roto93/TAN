Dear all,

  EA ARC at NAOJ provides the service to deliver calibrated MS on demand =
for PIs and archive users.=20
  The delivery service is offered for interferometric data which require =
CASA version 4.6.* or earlier only, basically corresponding to the data =
in Cycle 1-3 (calibrated MS are provided in the archive for Cycle 0).=20
   =20
  Below please find the detailed information from Fukagawa-san. Please =
request through the Helpdesk with necessary information as explained =
below.

best,
Yu-Nung

When you want to do imaging using ALMA interferometric data, you need =
to download raw data with the package including necessary scripts from =
the ALMA Science Archive, then run the calibration script using the =
right version of CASA shown in README (for Cycle 1-4) or =
qa2_report.html/pdf (for Cycle 5 and later) to produce the calibrated =
measurement sets (MS). However, it happens that you cannot calibrate the =
data since the recent Operating Systems are not officially supported for =
old versions of CASA.
=20
EA ARC provides the service to deliver calibrated MS on demand for PIs =
and archive users. Please request through the Helpdesk with necessary =
information as explained below. Please also note that we cannot deliver =
the data in a timely manner if many requests are received at the same =
time or requests include data with huge sizes. Thank you for your =
understanding for a possible delay of the delivery.
=20
-----------------------------------------------
- The delivery service is offered for interferometric data which =
require CASA version 4.6.* or earlier, basically corresponding to the =
data in Cycle 1-3 (calibrated MS are provided in the archive for Cycle =
0). The service is not offered for single-dish data.
- Please check the CASA version in README before you request the =
calibrated MS. Depending on the dataset, you do not have to download a =
package and can check README listed as the individual file in the data =
request page. If README with CASA version is not listed, you need to =
download the package ('product' package for Cycle 3 and earlier). The =
following list shows CASA versions that were used for data calibration. =
This does not always apply depending on the timing of QA2, but we hope =
that this helps before you look for the CASA versions to request the =
calibrated MS.
=20
    #cycle     CASA_version
    1 (2012.*)       4.2.0 - 4.2.1
    2 (2013.*)       4.2.2 - 4.4.0
    3 (2015.*)       4.3.1 - 4.6.0
    4 (2016.*)       4.7.0 - 4.7.2
=20
- Calibrated MS for up to 5 Scheduling Blocks can be requested at one =
time.
- The product that we will deliver is the outcome of running =
"scriptForPI.py".
- Notification will be sent as soon as the calibrated MS is ready. =
Then you will need to download the calibrated MS in 15 days.

1) Go to the download request page in the ALMA Science Archive=20

2) Check if there is an auxiliary package
2a. No auxiliary, no individual README listed

untar it, then=20
=E3=80=80=E3=80=80you can find README with the CASA version =
information.
