Dear All,

We will again have SMA school next spring.
This time, it will be a remote virtual school.
This means that you won't need to travel.
Please mark your calendar and wait for the
2nd announcement if you are interested in
this school.

Cheers,
Wei-Hao

Hi Wei-Hao,

Please would you be able to circulate this announcements for the SMA School to the ASIAA mailing list?

Thank you very much!

Dear Colleagues,

We are delighted to be releasing this First Announcement for the 2021 Submillimeter Array Interferometry School.

The school will be held virtually between March 14-19th 2021, and is organized by the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian, in conjunction with the Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA) and the University of Hawaii. The goals of the school are to provide graduate students, postdocs and scientists with a broad knowledge of interferometry and data reduction techniques at (sub)millimeter wavelengths.

The workshop will provide a series of online lectures on the fundamentals of radio interferometry with a special emphasis on observations at (sub)millimeter wavelengths along with data reduction tutorials with SMA observations. The school will extensively utilize the Submillimeter Array (SMA) on Mauna Kea, Hawaii and its new capabilities. Multiple sessions will be organized daily to accommodate participants from all time zones. We particularly stress the interactive nature of this School, where participants will be able to experience real-time data reduction for their own proposed projects. Further information can be found on the school website https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/sma-school/.

A second announcement will contain more details regarding the logistics of this virtual school, including the opening of registration in November. Questions can be sent to the School's email at sma-school@cfa.harvard.edu. Stay tuned and, for now, save the date!

The Organizing Committee
