Dear all,

Below you find the announcement of our first regular seminar within the Center of Astrophysics and Gravitation. Yao-Lun is an expert in radio observation of early phases of star formation. He will be visiting us for the whole day, please do not hesitate to come and talk to him if you are interested in sharing your work. We will go to dinner together after the seminar, please let me know if you would like to join.

Best regards,
Yueh-Ning

Title: Tracing Kinematics and Complex Chemistry of Embedded Protostars with ALMA
Abstract:
Infall drives the mass growth of protostars as well as the structural and chemical complexities.  The rich spectra of molecules best probe the kinematics and chemistry at the star-forming regions.  Using ALMA, we detect direct evidence of infall, the red-shifted absorption against the central continuum source, in the collapsing protostellar envelopes, such as B335 and BHR 71.  A simple inside-out rotating infalling envelope can reproduce the infall signatures.  However, the synthetic spectra disagree with the observations at off-center positions, hinting a faster rotation at the inner 50 au region compared to our envelope model.  Serendipitously, we also identified emissions of complex organic molecules (COMs), revealing the "hot corinos" nature of BHR 71.  Planet formation may start during the embedded phase of star formation.  In this scenario, the chemistry of embedded disks may directly determine the chemical composition of the forming planets.  In recent years, observat!
 ions discover several embedded protostars that have developed complex chemistry at the disk-forming region.  However, only a few observations attempt to constrain the occurrence of complex molecules at embedded protostars and their relationships to star formation processes.  I will present the first result of the Perseus ALMA Chemistry Survey (PEACHES), which aims to unbiasedly survey the chemistry toward 47 embedded protostars with a spatial resolution comparable to the size of disk-forming region.  I will discuss the detection statistics of these molecules with respect to the physical properties of these protostars, such as their evolutionary stages and disk properties.  I will also discuss the correlations of these complex molecules and the comparison with the chemistry of the protostars at other regions and environments.  The occurrence rate of different complex molecules learned from the PEACHES survey will provide a primer for constraining chemical evolution during th!
 e star formation.
