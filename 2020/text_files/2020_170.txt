1. KVN Call for Proposal (VLBI)
-----------------------------------------
Call for Proposals 2021A (KVN VLBI)
Proposal submission deadline: 2020 November 2, 08:00 UT
KVN website: https://kvn.kasi.re.kr/
-----------------------------------------

The Korean VLBI Network (KVN) invites scientific proposals for VLBI observations
during the 2021A season from astronomers around the world. Observations of successful
proposals will be scheduled between 2021 January 16 and June 15. Proposals should
be submitted via the KVN website (https://kvn.kasi.re.kr/) before the deadline of
UT 08:00 (KST 17:00) on 2020 November 2.


** Korean VLBI Network (KVN) **
The Korean VLBI Network (KVN) is a dedicated mm-VLBI network, operated by the Korea
Astronomy and Space Science Institute (KASI, https://www.kasi.re.kr/). Its three
21 m radio telescopes are located around South Korea in Seoul, Ulsan, and Jeju Island.
The baseline length ranges from 305 km to 476 km.

The simultaneous multi-frequency (22/43/86/129 GHz) observing mode in a dual-
polarization is available. Available data rates are 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16/32 Gbps
(limited time and observing mode available in case of 16/32 Gbps, see the details in
the KVN status report). Total time of 300 hours are planned for this call. If
requested in the proposals, the observing schedule can be allocated over a year,
until 2022 January 15, but the total observation time will not be increased.
Proposers should use the KVN VLBI observing application form and carefully follow
the instructions on the KVN website. The scientific and technical justification must
be provided within 3 pages. Details of the information and current status of the KVN
can be found in the KVN status report on the KVN website (https://kvn.kasi.re.kr/).
Proposals should be submitted via the KVN website.


** Note on the EATING VLBI observations**
According to the MoA between INAF (The Istituto Nazionale de Astrofisica) and KASI
up to 30 hours of observing time in VLBI mode are allocated to approved EATING VLBI
projects. These projects have to be submitted both to the Italian and Korean Time
Allocation Committees with the standard form selecting "EATING VLBI" mode in the
project type. Approved projects will be observed up to 30 hours/semester. Projects
exceeding 30 hours will be scheduled together with all other projects according to
their relative grades. PIs of these proposals must be associated with INAF or KASI.
The detailed formation can be found at the website:

2. KVN Call for Proposal (Single Dish)
-----------------------------------------
Call for Proposals 2021A (Single Dish)
Proposal submission deadline: 2020 November 2, 08:00 UT
KVN website: https://kvn.kasi.re.kr/
-----------------------------------------

The Korean VLBI Network (KVN) invites scientific proposals for single dish
observations for the 2021A season from Korean astronomical community. Observations
of successful proposals will be scheduled between 2021 January 16 and June 15.
Proposals should be submitted via the KVN website (https://kvn.kasi.re.kr/) before
the deadline of UT 08:00 (KST 17:00) on 2020 November 2.

The Korean VLBI Network (KVN) is operated by Korea Astronomy and Space Science
Institute (KASI, https://www.kasi.re.kr/). Its three 21m radio telescopes are
located in Seoul, Ulsan and Jeju Island. Both spectral and continuum observation
modes are supported. Available frequency bands are K (18-26 GHz) and Q (35-50 GHz),
86 (85-116 GHz), and 129 (125-142 GHz) GHz and simultaneous observation of the four
frequency bands is also possible. For each KVN telescope, 300 hours of single dish
observation time is available for this call. Therefore, total available time for
three KVN radio telescopes is about 900 hours.

Proposers should use the KVN single dish application form and carefully follow the
instructions on the KVN website. The scientific and technical justification must be
provided within 3 pages. Details of the information and current status of the KVN
can be found in the KVN status report on the KVN website (https://kvn.kasi.re.kr/).
