Dear all,

The 7th KAGRA international workshop (KIW) will be held on 18-20 December
2020 in National Central University, Taoyuan City, Taiwan. KIW focuses not
only the KAGRA project, but also encompasses all related fields such as
other gravitational wave experiments, gravitational wave sciences, and
multi-messenger astronomy.
KIW started in 2016 with a purpose to promote the world-wide gravitational
wave observation. This workshop has been coordinated by the KAGRA
scientific congress board and host region.
This workshop will cover various topics related to gravitational
observation; development and characterization of the current and future
detector, data analysis, and recent observational results (the results of
O3a, from April 2019 to September 2019 by LIGO and Virgo).  We encourage
researchers of both experiment and theory, especially of young generations,
to make contributions and exchange the ideas at this KIW7.

Due to the world-wide pandemic of COVID-19, we decided to employ the hybrid
style. You can attend workshop in face or online.
The meeting information is summarized as follows:
