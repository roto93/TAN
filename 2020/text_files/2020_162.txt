Title: Influence of Large Stellar Flares on Rocky Exoplanets=20

Abstract: Planets orbiting low-mass stars are prime systems for
atmospheric characterization due to their low star-to-planet brightness
contrast, high transit frequency, and prolonged main sequence stellar
lifetimes. However, small stars such as M-dwarfs are highly magnetically
active stemming from strong interactions between the stellar photosphere
and corona. As a result, the atmospheres of attendant rocky planets in
these systems may suffer severe atmospheric escape and chemical
modulations by strong X-ray and UV activity. Previous 1D models found
that although a single large flare does not substantially impact the
ozone layers, repeated secular flaring with the inclusion of highly
energetic particles could rapidly destroy the ozone columns of planets
with initially Earth-like atmospheres.=20

In this talk, I present our results in studying the effects of repeated
stellar flares on planets orbiting G-, K-, and M-stars using
state-of-the-art 3D models. First, I will briefly present key
conclusions from my previous work simulating the atmospheres of rocky
planets. Second, I will describe our methodology of this study by
coupling an M-dwarf flare model to the 3D atmosphere model.
Specifically, I will discuss how we compute realistic flare intensities,
frequencies, and durations with a flare toolkit with data drawn from
Hubble Space Telescope observational campaigns. I will then present new
results in that we find that recurring stellar flares drive planetary
atmospheres around K- and M-dwarfs into new chemical equilibria that
substantially deviate from their initial pre-flare regimes. This stems
from increased M-dwarf proton fluences, changes in the latitudinal
extensions of energetic particle deposition due to absence of planetary
magnetic fields, and transport via large-scale circulation and wave
breaking. Using a newly published radiative transfer model, I will show
that chemical compounds such as nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric acid
(HNO3) can be prominently observed throughout the entirety of the
planet's orbit in active stellar systems, making these "beacons of life"
highly amenable to detection by the James Webb Space Telescope and
next-generation instruments.
