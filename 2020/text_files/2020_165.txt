Speaker:    [Pizza lunch] Jonty Marshall (ASIAA)
Topic:         A giant planet candidate transiting a white dwarf
Time:         10/26 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:          R1203


*** Seminar ***

Speaker:    Dani Chao (MPA)
Topic:         Finding lensed quasars with time variability in imaging surveys
Time:         10/26 (Monday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:          R1203
Abstract:
Lensed quasars are powerful tools to study various topics in
astrophysics and cosmology, such as quasar host properties, dark
matter substructure, and the measurement of the Hubble constant, H_0.
To make the use of lensed quasar more efficient and competitive, it is
essential to enlarge the sample size of lensed quasars. I will present
a lensed quasar finding algorithm based on its variability.
Specifically, this variability-based lens finding algorithm detects
lensed quasar with the difference images from cadenced surveys. I will
show the application of this algorithm on the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC)
transient survey and the resulting lensed quasar candidates. With the
prospects of applying this variability-based algorithm on future
wide-field cadenced imaging surveys, such as LSST, we expect to
skillfully discover hundreds to thousands of new lensed quasars.

*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________
Speaker:    Pei-Ying Hsieh (ESO)
Topic:         Dynamics of streamers towards the CND - witnessed on-going mass accretion
Time:         10/28 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:          R1203
Abstract:
The interaction between a supermassive black hole (SMBH) and
the surrounding material is of primary importance in astrophysics. The
detection of the molecular 2-pc circumnuclear disk (CND) immediately
around the Milky Way SMBH, SgrA*, resembles the "molecular torus" in
AGNs, provides an unique opportunity to study SMBH accretion at
sub-parsec scales. However, the CND is transient if its gas density is
under the tidal threshold of SgrA*/nuclear star clusters, thus
depleting the source of fuel. In our new CS line maps, we find several
dense gas streamers appear to carry gas directly toward the nuclear
region and might be captured by the central potential. These streamers
show a signature of â€œinfallingâ€ motion with progressively higher
velocities as the gas approaches the CND and finally end up
co-rotating with the CND. Furthermore, utilizing the JCMT 850 um
polarization data, we also find that the magnetic field appears
dynamically significant toward the CND and also onwards to the inward
ionized flows.  Our results might suggest a possible mechanism of gas
feeding to the CND. I will also talk about the observed morphology,
kinematics of gas, and effects of magnetic fields in the GC. I will
present our newest ALMA CS line maps in this region and discuss the
gravitational stability of molecular cloud cores near Sgr A*.. As the
nearest observable Galactic nucleus, this feeding process may have
implications for understanding the processes in extragalactic nuclei.

***************************************************
Call for Proposals for the East Asian VLBI Network (EAVN) for the 2021A semester
Proposal submission deadline: 2020 November 2 (Mon.), 8:00 UT
EAVN website: https://eavn.kasi.re.kr/
***************************************************

--- Major revisions from the 2020B semester ---
* EAVN will be operated using 14 telescopes (VERA, KVN, Tianma, Sheshan, Nanshan,
  Nobeyama, Takahagi, Hitachi, and Yamaguchi). Availability of VERA's antenna
  will depend on the financial situation in the fiscal year 2021.
* C-band (6.7 GHz) observation mode is newly opened.
-----------------------------------------------


*** Overview ***
We invite proposals for open-use observations with the East Asian VLBI Network
(EAVN), which is the international collaborative VLBI array between China,
Korea, and Japan. In the 2021A semester, 14 telescopes (VERA 4 x 20 m, KVN
3 x 21 m, Tianma 65 m, Sheshan 25 m, Nanshan 26 m, Nobeyama 45 m, Takahagi 32 m,
Hitach 32 m, and Yamaguchi 32 m) participate in the EAVN open-use program\.


*** Observing mode ***
EAVN provides an opportunity of a VLBI observation with a data recording rate
of 1 Gbps (total bandwidth of 256 MHz and with single polarization at 6.7, 22,
and 43 GHz. Dual-frequency (22 and 43 GHz) simultaneous observation system
can be used for EAVN observations at KaVA and Nobeyama, while the session
will be set in which the system is available. Details of available observing
mode can be found in the EAVN Status Report on the EAVN website.


*** Telescope time and array configuration ***
The total available observation time for EAVN is up to 500 hours in the 2021A
semester, while the available observing time for individual EAVN telescopes are
different. All EAVN observations will be allocated between 2021 January 16 and
June 15. Please refer to the EAVN status report on the EAVN website for more
details.

EAVN accepts a request for usage of sub-array configuration (KaVA 7 telescopes
and additional telescopes from non-KaVA stations). There are several conditions
of the antenna combination depending on the observing frequency. Further details
about the sub-array configuration are shown in the EAVN status report.

The maximum request time for a single EAVN proposal is limited to 100 hours
in case of usage of only KaVA, while one can request for the maximum total
observation time of 36 hours for non-KaVA telescopes (except Nobeyama) for a
single proposal, and that of 24 hours for Nobeyama. Proposers can request
their project to be allocated over a year until the end of the 2021B semester
(2022 January 15), while the total request time of the proposal is still limited
as shown above.


*** Target of opportunity ***
EAVN accepts target of opportunity (ToO) proposals. Note that Nobeyama cannot
be included for ToO proposals. It is strongly recommended that ToO proposals
(especially expected ToO) are submitted during the regular CfP, while unexpected
or urgent ToO can be submitted as Director's Discretionary Time (DDT) proposals
at any time. ToO proposals must include clear triggering criteria to initiate
an observation. ToOs are valid for one year after it is approved. ToO proposals
for DDT should follow the same way of regular call and should be submitted via
the EAVN website.


*** Proposal submission ***
Proposals should be submitted via EAVN website. Proposal submission deadline
is 2020 November 2 (Mon.), 8:00 UT. Please refer to the EAVN status report for
detailed information about the proposal format. The designated cover sheet
form can be downloaded from the EAVN websites.


*** Acknowledgment ***
All EAVN users are asked to specify the acknowledgment to EAVN in their
publications. A template for the acknowledgment can be found in the EAVN
status report.
