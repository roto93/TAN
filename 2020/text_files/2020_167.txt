Topic:         Finding lensed quasars with time variability in imaging surveys
Time:         10/26 (Monday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:          R1203
Abstract:
Lensed quasars are powerful tools to study various topics in
astrophysics and cosmology, such as quasar host properties, dark
matter substructure, and the measurement of the Hubble constant, H_0.
To make the use of lensed quasar more efficient and competitive, it is
essential to enlarge the sample size of lensed quasars. I will present
a lensed quasar finding algorithm based on its variability.
Specifically, this variability-based lens finding algorithm detects
lensed quasar with the difference images from cadenced surveys. I will
show the application of this algorithm on the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC)
transient survey and the resulting lensed quasar candidates. With the
prospects of applying this variability-based algorithm on future
wide-field cadenced imaging surveys, such as LSST, we expect to
skillfully discover hundreds to thousands of new lensed quasars.

Topic:         Dynamics of streamers towards the CND - witnessed on-going mass accretion
Time:         10/28 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:          R1203
Abstract:
The interaction between a supermassive black hole (SMBH) and
the surrounding material is of primary importance in astrophysics. The
detection of the molecular 2-pc circumnuclear disk (CND) immediately
around the Milky Way SMBH, SgrA*, resembles the "molecular torus" in
AGNs, provides an unique opportunity to study SMBH accretion at
sub-parsec scales. However, the CND is transient if its gas density is
under the tidal threshold of SgrA*/nuclear star clusters, thus
depleting the source of fuel. In our new CS line maps, we find several
dense gas streamers appear to carry gas directly toward the nuclear
region and might be captured by the central potential. These streamers
show a signature of â€œinfallingâ€ motion with progressively higher
velocities as the gas approaches the CND and finally end up
co-rotating with the CND. Furthermore, utilizing the JCMT 850 um
polarization data, we also find that the magnetic field appears
dynamically significant toward the CND and also onwards to the inward
ionized flows.  Our results might suggest a possible mechanism of gas
feeding to the CND. I will also talk about the observed morphology,
kinematics of gas, and effects of magnetic fields in the GC. I will
present our newest ALMA CS line maps in this region and discuss the
gravitational stability of molecular cloud cores near Sgr A*.. As the
nearest observable Galactic nucleus, this feeding process may have
implications for understanding the processes in extragalactic nuclei.
