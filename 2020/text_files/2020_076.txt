Dear Yi-Jehng and Shih-Ping,

    Hope all is well.

    I'm actively looking to fill a PhD and a RA position. Please see in the following the ads for the PhD https://www.dropbox.com/s/b3bcivrztl5tf34/call.pdf?dl=0 and the RA https://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/jobopening/ad.php?i=e1a68d0ad2c39d755d73bce2e4be24b3.
It'd be greatly appreciated if you could kindly forward this information to whoever might be interested. Thanks very much!

Cheers,
TC

*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________
Speaker:    Yao-Lun Yang (University of Virginia)
Topic:         The ALMA View of Complex Chemistry toward Embedded Protostars
Time:         5/27 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:          R1203
Abstract:
Planet formation may start during the embedded phase of star formation.  In this scenario, the chemistry of embedded disks may directly determine the chemical composition of the forming planets.  In recent years, observations discover several embedded protostars that have developed complex chemistry at the disk-forming region.  However, only a few observations attempt to constrain the occurrence of complex molecules at embedded protostars and their relationships to star formation processes.  I will present the first result of the Perseus ALMA Chemistry Survey (PEACHES), which aims to unbiasedly survey the chemistry toward 47 embedded protostars with a spatial resolution comparable to the size of disk-forming region.  In PEACHES, we identify a variety of molecules and their isotopologues, including CCH, c-C3H2, SO, SO2, CH3OH, CH3CN, CH3OCHO, CH3OCH3, and C2H5OH.  I will discuss the detection statistics of these molecules with respect to the physical properties of these proto!
 stars, such as their evolutionary stages and disk properties.  I will also discuss the correlations of these complex molecules and the comparison with the chemistry of the protostars at other regions and environments.  The occurrence rate of different complex molecules learned from the PEACHES survey will provide a primer for constraining chemical evolution during the star formation.
