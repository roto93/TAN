*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________
Speaker:    Ting-Yun Cheng (Sunny) (Durham University)
Topic:         What a machine sees? - Galaxy morphological classification told through machine learning
Time:         1/20 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:          R1203
Abstract:
Along with the significant development of astronomical data in 4V aspects (Volume, Velocity, Variety, and Value/Veracity), machine learning techniques, as an analysis tool, are applied in a broad range of astronomical studies. In my PhD, I studied galaxy morphology with supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques for two types of tasks - classification and exploration. In this talk, I will give an overview about how I think machine learning techniques can be used in astronomical studies, in particular, galaxy morphological classification, with four projects I accomplished during my PhD using a broad range of data (DES, SDSS, simulated data for Euclid). Additionally, I would like to bring up a discussion about a possibility of a new astronomical approach may be carried out through machineâ€™s perspective.
