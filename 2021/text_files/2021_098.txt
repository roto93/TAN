Dear Yi-Jehng

Could you please circulate this on TAN?  It should be of interest to
colleagues and
students working on star and planet formation.

Thanks.

Wen Ping

Dear SAC members


      We are now starting the pre-registration of PPVII meeting.  Given the
uncertain situation of COVID-19 pandemic and vaccination, PP7 organizers
consider that it is good to start with an unofficial pre-registration, so
that we can (A) make an e-mail list for potential participants to provide
updates on the conference and (B) know the intent of participation to
estimate the number of on-site participants and poster presentations.  We
hope to start the official registration late summer or early autumn.

      Please visit the following:
      http://ppvii.org/pre-registration/index.html

      After completing the Google Form for pre-registration (in the above
link), you will receive a copy of your answer sent from Google Form.  You
will be added to the e-mail list for pre-registered participants
automatically. Please also distribute the information about the
pre-registration to your colleagues,  students, other mailing list, etc.

      The Pre-registration Form comes with a small questionnaire about the
intention of participation.  Although the situation is uncertain, we assume
the most optimistic case =E2=80=93 most of us are vaccinated and can travel.
Please understand that we will use this questionnaire only for collecting
intentions. Since the number of answers can be many hundreds, we will not
respond to each of them.

      As for Japan, the situation on vaccination is much behind of many
western countries but we hope the situation will be improved in 6 months.


Best Regards,
Shu-ichiro Inutsuka, on behalf of PP7 Editors
