*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________
Speaker:    Ting-Yun Cheng (Sunny) (Durham University)
Topic:         What a machine sees? - Galaxy morphological classification told through machine learning
Time:         1/20 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:          R1203
Abstract:
Along with the significant development of astronomical data in 4V aspects (Volume, Velocity, Variety, and Value/Veracity), machine learning techniques, as an analysis tool, are applied in a broad range of astronomical studies. In my PhD, I studied galaxy morphology with supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques for two types of tasks - classification and exploration. In this talk, I will give an overview about how I think machine learning techniques can be used in astronomical studies, in particular, galaxy morphological classification, with four projects I accomplished during my PhD using a broad range of data (DES, SDSS, simulated data for Euclid). Additionally, I would like to bring up a discussion about a possibility of a new astronomical approach may be carried out through machineâ€™s perspective.

The phased ALMA array is expected to participate in Global mm-VLBI Array =
(GMVA) observations during ALMA Cycle 8 2021 (October 2021 - September =
2022). An introduction to the GMVA+ALMA observing mode is available at =
https://astro.uni-bonn.de/ARC/development/mmvlbi/guidelines.shtml =
<https://astro.uni-bonn.de/ARC/development/mmvlbi/guidelines.shtml> and =
the details on proposal submission are also described at =
https://science.nrao.edu/observing/call-for-proposals/2021b/vlba-proposal-=
guide =
<https://science.nrao.edu/observing/call-for-proposals/2021b/vlba-proposal=
-guide>.
If you are planning to submit a GMVA+ALMA proposal, please read the =
following policies regarding your submission :
1) If you have already submitted a proposal requesting GMVA+ALMA at the =
GMVA deadline in 2020, consider that it has been reviewed by the GMVA =
observatories, but not by ALMA. On the GMVA side, these projects will be =
carried over (with their grades) for possible scheduling in the GMVA =
Session I 2022. These proposals will compete with any new GMVA+ALMA =
proposals submitted at the February 2021 deadline. On the ALMA side, =
proposals must be re-submitted by the ALMA proposal deadline on 21 April =
2021, and will be reviewed together with any newly submitted GMVA+ALMA =
proposals.
2) If you have already submitted a proposal requesting GMVA+ALMA and =
would like to revise your proposal, you can do so by submitting a =
revised version to the GMVA before 01 February 2021 in addition to =
submitting the proposal to ALMA by the proposal deadline on 21 April =
2021. In those cases, proposers should give the code number of the =
earlier GMVA proposal that is superseded.
3) If you consider submitting a new proposal for GMVA+ALMA, it must be =
submitted to the GMVA before the GMVA deadline on 01 February 2021. In =
addition, a separate proposal must be submitted to ALMA by the deadline =
on 21 April 2021.=
