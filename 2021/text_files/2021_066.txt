Dear members,

Greetings.
IANCU will be running a series of zoom online lectures on numerical
simulation with the "PLUTO" code in May.
Could you announce the following information about the event via TAN,
please?  Thank you very much.

-----------Information is below------------

We are pleased to invite you to join us for a series of online lectures
given by Dr. Milijenko Cemeljic on numerical simulations using the "PLUTO"
code.
The event is organized by the Institute of Astronomy, NCU.

*Date*: May 4, May 6, May 11, May 13, and May 18, 2021 (Five classes in
total.)
*Time*: 4 pm to 6 pm (TW time, UTC+8) each class.

***Lecturer***: Miljenko Cemeljic, NCAC, Poland & ASIAA, Taiwan

***Title***: Numerical simulations with PLUTO code
***Place*** : Online
***Abstract***:
Aim of the lectures is to guide attendants to active using of the PLUTO
code. We will work in 5x2 hrs blocks: each hour of theoretical exposition
will be followed by an hour of hands-on work with the code. We will start
with a brief introduction to numerical simulations in astrophysics and the
position of the PLUTO code with respect to other codes. After a short
description of numerical methods employed in the code, we will proceed with
the code installation, testing of the installation, and initial
visualization of the results with gnuplot. Next, we will set a purely
hydrodynamic accretion disk in 2D, and learn to use more advanced
visualization tools like Paraview and VisIt. I will also show the use of
Python for visualization. On the example of adding the magnetic field in
the accretion disk simulation, we will next learn the basics of the
magneto-hydrodynamic simulations, both in ideal and non-ideal (viscous and
resistive) approaches. I will show how to use a Linux cluster for
simulations, and how to plot the magnetic field lines. In the last lecture,
we will learn the setting of the full 3D magnetic accretion disk and
visualization of the results.
