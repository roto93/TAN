*Colloquium on March 09*

Dear Colleagues,

*You are cordially invited to attend the Joint Colloquium which will be
held on Mar 09. *

The Joint Colloquium Series is organized by the NTU Physics Department, NTU
Center for Theoretical Physics, Center for Condensed Matter Science (CCMS),
Leung Center for Cosmology and Particle Astrophysics (LeCosPA), Academia
Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA), the Institute of
Atomic and Molecular Sciences (IAMS), and the NTNU Physics Department.

The idea is to have excellent speakers to give inspiring, informative, but
non-technical talks on the frontiers of Sciences.

Enclosed below is the information of the *Joint Colloquium on* *Mar 09*.

*ASIAA/CCMS/IAMS/LeCosPA/NTNU-Physics/NTU-Physics Joint Colloquium*

*Time: 3/9 (Tue) 14:20 *

*Place: Chin-Pao Yang Lecture Hall (Room 104), CCMS-New Physics Building*

*Speaker: Professor Heng-Liang Wu (Center for Condensed Matter Sciences,
National Taiwan University)*

*Topic: Vibrational Spectroscopy at Electrochemical Interfaces:
Electrocatalytic Conversion of CO2 and Lithium-Sulfur Battery*

*Abstract: Electrochemical energy conversion and storage processes occurred
in the electrolyzer and battery devices play a vital role in the
development of sustainable energy technologies. The predominant mechanism
of the devices involves the charge transfer and various redox reactions on
the solid-liquid interfaces which affect the reactivity and performance. In
order to reveal the reaction mechanism, in-situ vibrational spectroscopy
techniques such as Raman and surface-enhanced infrared absorption
spectroscopy are the powerful tools for examining reaction intermediates on
the solid-liquid interfaces. In this talk, we report on our use of in-situ
SEIRAS to investigate the electrochemical CO2 reduction mechanism over the
Cu electrocatalysts and in situ Raman spectroscopy to study the effect of
electrolyte on the sulfur reduction mechanism in lithium-sulfur battery.
Various in situ techniques were used to provide the complementary
information in the energy conversion and storage systems. The reaction
mechanism will be discussed in detail.*
