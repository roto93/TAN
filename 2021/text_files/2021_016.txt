Array Recovery Status Update
Jan 25, 2021
https://almascience.nao.ac.jp/news/array-recovery-status-update

Dear colleagues,
While the COVID-19 pandemic persists all around the world, ALMA staff at =
the JAO and in the regions continue to work towards bringing the array =
back online, with the ultimate goal to resume science operations and =
deliver high-quality science data to our users.
At this moment, the ALMA antennas are in the process of being powered up =
and inspected after having been stowed for about 300 days. The central =
local oscillator and the two correlators at the high site have =
successfully been started and the first antennas have been paired up to =
perform initial interferometric testing by science operations.
The Operations Support Facility (OSF) can now sustain a minimum number =
of ALMA staff. Nevertheless, the way towards science observations is =
still long and uncertain and heavily depends on issues that may be =
discovered as well as on the pandemic situation in Chile and the rest of =
the world.
The ALMA Regional Centres (ARCs) continue to assist ALMA users with the =
reduction and analysis of existing data through virtual face-to-face =
(f2f) support, in addition to answering the usual Helpdesk queries. If =
you have any questions, want to sign up for a virtual f2f visit, or have =
comments or concerns related to the situation at ALMA, please contact =
the ALMA Helpdesk at https://help.almascience.org =
<https://help.almascience.org/>.
All ALMA staff wish you and your families to remain safe and healthy.=

Speaker:    Chih-Fan Chen (UCLA)
Topic:         [Remote talk] H0 measurement from time-delay cosmography
Time:         2/3 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:          R1203
Abstract:
The Hubble constant is one of the most important parameters in
cosmology. Its value directly sets the age, the size, and the critical
density of the Universe. Despite the success of the flat LCDM model, the
derived Hubble constant from Planck data under the assumption of a flat
LCDM model has 4.4-sigma tension with the direct measurements. If this
tension is not due to the systematics, it may indicate the new physics
beyond the standard cosmological model. H_0 from time-delay lensing is
a powerful independent tool for addressing the H_0 tension since it is
independent of both Planck and the distance ladder. One way to do this
is to increase the number of high-quality lens systems since this allows
us to look for correlations and other effects due to systematics, and to do
hierarchical approaches to assess known systematic effects. Keck AO
data is not only the key component to increase the precision of H0
measurement but also provides systematic checks with the H_0 results
based on HST imaging. In this talk, I will present the current H_0
measurement, the systematic checks, and the future prospective of
TDCOSMO collaboration.
