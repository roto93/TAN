Title: Tasting Saturn's rings and Enceladus' ocean water

Abstract: How old are Saturn's rings? Could life exist elsewhere in the
solar system? Thanks to the 13-year-exploration of the Cassini-Huygens
mission at Saturn, we are a step closer to answer these fundamental
questions. In this talk, I will review the current understanding of
Saturn's ring system and the plausible connection to the origin and
evolution of Saturn's icy satellites. Among them, I will focus on
Enceladus, a 500-km-sized icy moon constantly emitting 200 kg of water
vapor and ice grains from its south-polar fissures each second, and why
it is considered one of the potentially habitable Ocean Worlds in the
solar system. The presentation will be summarized with highlights about
the interactions between the ring-moon system and its host planet,
connections to various astrophysical phenomena, and future solar system
explorations.
