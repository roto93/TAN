Dear colleagues,

Since 17 March 2021, the 12-m Array has consistently been used for PI =
science observations, usually using more than 37 antennas in the 12-m =
Array. Unfortunately, it has become clear that the recent increase in =
the number of COVID-19 cases in Chile will have an impact on ALMA =
observations. Several areas in Chile are back to full lockdown and the =
anticipated addition of more staff to the ALMA site to conduct the =
change of ALMA configurations will be delayed by a minimum of 20 days.

While ALMA will continue to conduct Cycle 7 science observations in the =
current C43-5 configuration on a best-effort basis, the move to more =
extended configurations will be postponed until at least early May. This =
is to ensure the safety of all ALMA staff, as well as the Array, and to =
plan for a smooth transition to the start of Cycle 8 2021 in October.

As always, status updates will be provided in the Science Portal on a =
regular basis as information becomes available. The ALMA Regional =
Centers also continue to provide support for ALMA users. If you have any =
questions, or have comments or concerns related to the situation at =
ALMA, please contact the ALMA Helpdesk at https://help.almascience.org/.

All ALMA staff wish you and your families to stay safe and healthy.=E2=80=8B=
