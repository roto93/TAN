Amplitude calibration issue affecting some ALMA data
Jun 15, 2021
https://almascience.nao.ac.jp/news/amplitude-calibration-issue-affecting-some-alma-data


A visibility amplitude calibration error that affects fields containing strong astronomical emission has been discovered in ALMA interferometer observations up to and including Cycle 7. This calibration scaling error originates in the combined effect of correlator spectral normalization and Tsys calibration and affects both 12-m Array and Atacama Compact Array observations. The effect of this amplitude scaling error is most notable for observations of strong, relatively narrow spectral lines, typically related to Galactic ISM and Galactic star formation (e.g., molecular lines, masers, etc.).

Full technical details of the issue can be found in the Knowledgebase article: https://help.almascience.org/kb/articles/what-errors-could-originate-from-the-correlator-spectral-normalization-and-tsys-calibration.

ALMA has carried out a detailed investigation of this issue and concluded that in some cases this amplitude scaling error can exceed the nominal absolute flux calibration accuracy quoted in the ALMA Technical Handbook. The largest effect occurs in the brightest channels, and the effect can also limit imaging dynamic range.

ALMA has developed a procedure to identify affected datasets taken in FDM mode (conservatively defined as those with a >2% flux scale offset). For all affected datasets that have yet to be delivered, including those that will be observed in the remainder of Cycle 7, ALMA will apply a renormalization correction during data processing to correctly scale the amplitude calibration before being sent to PIs. For affected data in the ALMA Archive, an investigation is underway and plans will be described in a future announcement.

We regret any inconvenience or impact experienced by our ALMA users due to this issue. If you have any questions, or have comments or concerns, please contact your local ALMA Regional Center via the ALMA Helpdesk at https://help.almascience.org/.

Dear Yi-Jehng

Could you please circulate this on TAN?  It should be of interest to
colleagues and
students working on star and planet formation.

Thanks.

Wen Ping

Dear SAC members


      We are now starting the pre-registration of PPVII meeting.  Given the
uncertain situation of COVID-19 pandemic and vaccination, PP7 organizers
consider that it is good to start with an unofficial pre-registration, so
that we can (A) make an e-mail list for potential participants to provide
updates on the conference and (B) know the intent of participation to
estimate the number of on-site participants and poster presentations.  We
hope to start the official registration late summer or early autumn.

      Please visit the following:
      http://ppvii.org/pre-registration/index.html

      After completing the Google Form for pre-registration (in the above
link), you will receive a copy of your answer sent from Google Form.  You
will be added to the e-mail list for pre-registered participants
automatically. Please also distribute the information about the
pre-registration to your colleagues,  students, other mailing list, etc.

      The Pre-registration Form comes with a small questionnaire about the
intention of participation.  Although the situation is uncertain, we assume
the most optimistic case =E2=80=93 most of us are vaccinated and can travel.
Please understand that we will use this questionnaire only for collecting
intentions. Since the number of answers can be many hundreds, we will not
respond to each of them.

      As for Japan, the situation on vaccination is much behind of many
western countries but we hope the situation will be improved in 6 months.


Best Regards,
Shu-ichiro Inutsuka, on behalf of PP7 Editors
