Arizona Radio Observatory: Call for Proposals (2021A)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To Astronomers and Astrophysicists of Taiwan,

The Arizona Radio Observatory (ARO) solicits observing proposals for the 10-meter Submillimeter Telescope (SMT) located on Mount Graham, Arizona, for the period March 15, 2021 â€“ June 15, 2021. No new proposals for the ALMA Prototype 12-meter Telescope (12m) located on Kitt Peak, Arizona will be accepted for this current call as proposals from the 2020A call for proposals are being observed during the 2021A proposal period. Proposal candidates from members of the University Consortium of ALMA-Taiwan (UCAT) and ASIAA should submit up to THREE pages of scientific and technical justification (including figures, tables, and references) in addition to their Proposal Summary Sheet (form here):
https://www.as.arizona.edu/sites/default/files/ARO_Proposal_Cover_Sheet.pdf

All proposal candidates are required to list on the Proposal Summary Sheet their requested observing blocks (the exact LST ranges to be scheduled and number of times to be repeated), dates on which they are NOT available to observe, and dates in which sources in those observing blocks are within the Sun-avoidance zone (45 degrees at the SMT).

The 10m SMT currently supports dual-polarization sideband-separating (SBS) observations at 1mm (211â€“280 GHz) and dual-polarization double-sideband observations at 0.8mm (325â€“370 GHz). The SMT control system supports both dual-polarization ("2 IF mode") and dual-polarization + dual-sideband observations ("4 IF mode") with tunable IF from 4.5â€“7.5 GHz, for position-switched, beam-switched, and OTF observations.  Proposal candidates should consult the ARO Equipment Summary and Status sheet for additional technical specifications:
https://www.as.arizona.edu/arizona-radio-observatory .

The SMT is currently restricted to remote observing. Observers must supply fixed IP address(es) of the computer(s) that will be used during observing on their Proposal Summary Sheet. For further information about remote observing and other operational questions, please contact the ARO Software Engineer Natalie Gandilo ngandilo@email.arizona.edu

Scheduling of successful proposals will be done according to availability of the receivers requested. Proposals which request observing time greater than 24 hours will be considered based on scientific merit. Participation of graduate students is especially encouraged. Proposals should be emailed as a single file in PDF format to: kuan[at]asiaa.sinica.edu.tw by 23:59 CST on February 22, 2021 (Monday).
