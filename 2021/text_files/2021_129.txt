Proposals submitted in the Supplemental Call will be peer reviewed using =

Proposals with targets at any RA will be considered, but those that can =
be observed in the LST range 20 to 10 h are particularly encouraged. =
Note that 7m-Array polarization observations are not offered at this =
Supplemental Call. In addition, time-constrained and =
Target-of-Opportunity (ToO) observations are not offered at this Call =
for Proposals. A minimum of 1500 h will be allocated each on the 7-m =
Array and the Total Power Array to proposals submitted at this Call.

Information about targets that are already in the observing queue can be =
found on the Duplicate Observations page =
(https://almascience.nao.ac.jp/proposing/duplications =
<https://almascience.nao.ac.jp/proposing/duplications>).

Users should note that the Supplemental Call proposal submission server =
