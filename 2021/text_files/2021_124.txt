FYI. I understand that the schedule is very close to the final exams
(depending on when exactly your semester end).
If we receive a lot of registrations from local (junior), we may consider
doing our own hand-on session in language TBD, i.e.,
I personally would not insist on doing a full English lecture.

Dear Colleagues,

We are delighted to be releasing this First Announcement for the 2022
Submillimeter Array Interferometry School.

The school will be held virtually between 18-22 January 2022, and is
organized by the Center for Astrophysics, in conjunction with the Academia
Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics and the University of
Hawaii. The goals of the school are to provide graduate students, postdocs,
and scientists with a broad knowledge of interferometry and data reduction
techniques at (sub)millimeter wavelengths.

The workshop will provide a series of online lectures on the fundamentals
of radio interferometry with a special emphasis on observations at
(sub)millimeter wavelengths along with data reduction tutorials with SMA
observations. The school will extensively utilize the Submillimeter Array
(SMA) on Mauna Kea, Hawaii and its new capabilities. Multiple sessions will
be organized daily to accommodate participants from all time zones. We
particularly stress the interactive nature of this School, where
participants will be able to experience real-time data reduction for their
own proposed projects. Further information can be found on the school
website  https://lweb.cfa.harvard.edu/sma-school/

A second announcement will contain more details regarding the logistics of
this virtual school, including the opening of registration in September.
Questions can be sent to the School=E2=80=99s email at sma-school@cfa.harva=
rd.edu.
Stay tuned and, for now, save the date!
