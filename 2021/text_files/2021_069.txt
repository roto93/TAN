Date: Thu, 22 Apr 2021 04:39:32 +0000

Dear colleagues,

This e-mail is to announce 'Call for Proposals (CfP) for the East Asian VLBI
Network (EAVN)' for the 2021B semester. Please refer to the following EAVN
website for more details about the array's specification, available observation
modes, and how to submit proposals.

https://eavn.kasi.re.kr/


Best regards,

Kiyoaki Wajima
(KASI; in place of EAVN directors)


-------------------------------------------------

***************************************************
Call for Proposals for the East Asian VLBI Network (EAVN)
for the 2021B semester
Proposal submission deadline: 2021 June 1 (Tue.), 8:00 UT
EAVN website: https://eavn.kasi.re.kr/
***************************************************

--- Major revisions from the 2021A semester ---
* Kunming 40-m telescope joins in EAVN open-use program. EAVN will be operated
  using 15 telescopes (VERA, KVN, Tianma, Sheshan, Nanshan, Kunming, Nobeyama,
  Takahagi, Hitachi, and Yamaguchi) in the 2021B semester.
* Total approved time for target of opportunity (ToO) observation is limited to
  be 100 hours.
* No upper limit on the total request time for one proposal is set for KaVA 7
  telescopes, while the total request time is set for non-KaVA telescopes.
* Detailed condition on the time allocation of Nobeyama 45-m telescope is defined.
* EAVN abolishes accepting a proposal requesting one-year-long observations from
  the 2021B semester.
-----------------------------------------------


*** Overview ***
We invite proposals for open-use observations with the East Asian VLBI Network
(EAVN), which is the international collaborative VLBI array between China, Korea,
and Japan. In the 2021B semester, 15 telescopes (VERA 4 x 20 m, KVN 3 x 21 m,
Tianma 65 m, Sheshan 25 m, Nanshan 26 m, Kunming 40 m, Nobeyama 45 m, Takahagi 32 m,
Hitachi 32 m, and Yamaguchi 32 m) participate in the EAVN open-use program.


*** Observing mode ***
EAVN provides opportunities of VLBI observations with a data recording rate of
1 Gbps (total bandwidth of 256 MHz and with single polarization at 6.7, 22, and
43 GHz. Dual-frequency (22 and 43 GHz) simultaneous observation system can also
be used for EAVN observations at KaVA and Nobeyama, while the observing term in
which the system is available will be determined. Details of available observing
mode can be found in the EAVN Status Report on the EAVN website.


*** Telescope time and array configuration ***
The total available observation time for EAVN is up to 500 hours in the 2021B
semester, while the available observing time for individual EAVN telescopes are
different. Especially, detailed conditions on the time allocation of Nobeyama
45-m telescope are defined in the 2021B semester. Please refer to the EAVN status
report on the EAVN website for more details. All EAVN observations will be allocated
between 2021 September 1 and 2022 January 15.

EAVN accepts a request for usage of sub-array configuration (KaVA 7 telescopes
and additional telescopes from non-KaVA stations). There are several conditions
of the antenna combination depending on the observing frequency. Further details
about the sub-array configuration are shown in the EAVN status report.

In the 2021B semester, no limitation of the maximum request time for a single
proposal is determined in case of usage of only KaVA 7 stations, while one can
request for the maximum total telescope time of 50 hours for Tianma/Sheshan and
Nanshan, and 36 hours for Takahagi, Hitachi, Yamaguchi, and Kunming. Total telescope
time of 24 hours for Nobeyama can be requested for a proposal. EAVN abolishes
accepting a proposal requesting one-year-long observations from the 2021B semester.
One should thus submit a proposal by a submission deadline for each semester.


*** Target of opportunity ***
EAVN accepts target of opportunity (ToO) proposals. Note that Nobeyama and Kunming
cannot be included for ToO proposals. It is strongly recommended that ToO proposals
(especially expected ToO) are submitted during the regular CfP, while unexpected
or urgent ToO can be submitted as Director's Discretionary Time (DDT) proposals
at any time. Note that the total approved time for ToO observation in the 2021B
semester is limited to be 100 hours for ToO proposals for both expected and
unexpected events.

ToO proposals must address clear triggering criteria to initiate an observation.
ToOs are valid for one year after it is approved. ToO proposals for DDT should
follow the same way of regular call and should be submitted via the EAVN website.


*** Proposal submission ***
Proposals should be submitted via the EAVN website. Proposal submission deadline
is 2021 June 1 (Tue.), 8:00 UT. Please refer to the EAVN status report for detailed
information about the proposal format. The designated cover sheet form can be
downloaded from the EAVN websites.


*** Acknowledgment ***
All EAVN users are asked to specify the acknowledgment to EAVN in their publications.
A template for the acknowledgment can be found in the EAVN status report.
