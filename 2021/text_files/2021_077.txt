Invitation for Proposals: Cycle-12
Deadline for Receipt of Proposals:
23:59:59 UT on 13th May 2021

Full Details: http://www.e-merlin.ac.uk/observe.html



e-MERLIN requests proposals from the international astronomical community f=
or observations to be made during Cycle-12. Proposals are competitively pee=
r-reviewed under standard STFC rules by the Programme Allocation of Telesco=
pe Time (PATT) e-MERLIN Time Allocation Group. Allocation will be made on t=
he basis of scientific merit and technical feasibility alone.

e-MERLIN Science: e-MERLIN observations address a broad range of science to=
pics, http://www.e-merlin.ac.uk/science.html<http://www.e-merlin.ac.uk/scie=
nce.html%20> and its unique combination of angular resolution (mas) and sen=
sitivity (microJy) provide crucial insights in multiple science areas inclu=
ding:


  *   Star-formation and black hole growth in galaxies.
  *   The physical processes which govern the formation of stars.
  *   The modes of activity in nearby galaxies.
  *   Transient radio sources.
  *   Radio spectral lines (masers and in absorption).
  *   The energetic processes in relativistic outflows from jets generated =
by black holes and compact objects.
  *   Along with multiple other applications.

e-MERLIN provides high angular resolution (12 - 150 milli-arcsec) and high =
sensitivity (micro-Janksy) imaging at cm wavelengths as well as polarimetry=
, spectroscopy, and astrometry. e-MERLIN is an SKA-pathfinder instrument pr=
oviding observations with resolutions and frequencies comparable to those t=
hat will be provided by SKA1-mid.


Cycle-12 e-MERLIN Capabilities

[e-MERLIN observations between August 1st, 2021 and January 31st, 2022 ]
Deadline for Receipt of Proposals:
23:59:59 UT on 13th May 2021

                                             Ang. res.    Sensitivity
L-band (1.25 - 1.75 GHz)      ~150 mas    ~12 uJy/bm*
  C-band (4.5 - 7.5 GHz)         ~ 40 mas      ~10 uJy/bm*
K-band (19 - 25 GHz)            ~12 mas      ~130 uJy/bm


* Assumes inclusion of the Lovell Telescope at L/C-band and a full imaging =
track (~12hrs including calibration). It is envisaged that a limited amount=
 of Lovell time will be available for PATT programmes during Cycle 12. The =
full invitation for proposals, including technical specifications, and link=
s to the e-MERLIN Sensitivity Calculator are available at: www.e-merlin.ac.=
uk/observe.html<http://www.e-merlin.ac.uk/observe.html>.


Access and financial support for e-MERLIN Scientists and Users: e-MERLIN is=
 open to all users with projects allocated solely on the basis of scientifi=
c merit and technical feasibility. Additionally, e-MERLIN is one of the par=
ticipating infrastructures in the European Union=92s Horizon 2020 research =
and innovation programme, the OPTICON-RadioNet PILOT project was launched o=
n March 1st, 2021. This programme will provide facility access and financia=
l support for users from eligible projects in Cycle-12.  For further inform=
ation or contact e-MERLIN staff (emerlin@jb.man.ac.uk<mailto:emerlin@jb.man=
.ac.uk>).



EVN+e-MERLIN Observations: The full integration of e-MERLIN telescopes with=
in the European VLBI Network is also available. This mode of observing prov=
ides e-MERLIN=92s additional 'short-spacing' (10 - 200 km) component availa=
ble to the EVN which allows imaging of a wider range of spatial scales. Pro=
posals for e-MERLIN + EVN observations should be made via the EVN Programme=
 Committee rather than through e-MERLIN directly. The next Call for EVN Pro=
posals (including combined e-MERLIN + EVN observations) is detailed at www.=
evlbi.org<http://www.evlbi.org>. The next deadlines for EVN proposals are J=
une 1st , & October 1st , 2021.
