Hi everyone,

This is a reminder that the first talk of the NCU-Delta online talk =
series in Fall 2021 will be given by Dr. Jean-Baptiste Vincent from DLR =
Institute of Planetary Research on 8 pm Sep 15 (GMT+8). Please find =
below and the attached poster for more details. Could you please help =
circulate this message to anyone who might be interested? Much =
appreciated!

Title:=20
Next frontiers in the exploration of asteroids and comets

Abstract:
The planetary science community has been fortunate to experience many =
fantastic missions to asteroids and comets in the last decade: from =
Rosetta (ESA) reaching and landing on a comet, to Hayabusa 2 (JAXA) and =
OSIRIS-REX (NASA) collecting samples from Near-Earth asteroids, and many =
other projects. Our knowledge of small bodies has improved tremendously, =
and so have our questions. The more we learn about those objects, the =
more we discover that their structure, composition, history, are more =
complex than we thought. Their stories are entangled in many ways with =
the formation and evolution of our Solar System: asteroids and comets =
contain in their core elements answers to fundamental questions about =
our planets came to be. Asteroids and comets may be =E2=80=9Csmall =
bodies=E2=80=9D but their study will  bring constraints to many =E2=80=9Cb=
ig questions=E2=80=9D in our field: from the early ages of planet =
formation in Solar and Extrasolar systems, to planetary evolution and =
life on our Earth.

The next decade is on track to be even more exciting: almost every space =
agency has selected or is planning a mission to a comet or an asteroid, =
if not both ! In this presentation I will give an overview of some of =
the most fundamental open questions in our field and how the next =
generation of spacecrafts will address those. I will give a short =
summary of the upcoming missions then present in more details two =
specific projects: AIDA (ESA/NASA) and Comet Interceptor (ESA/JAXA), =
which will provide unique opportunities for small bodies science in the =
coming years.

The Cycle 8 2021 ACA Supplemental Call for Proposals is now OPEN!!
=
https://almascience.nao.ac.jp/news/the-cycle-8-2021-aca-supplemental-call-=
for-proposals-is-now-open


The Joint ALMA Observatory (JAO) is now accepting observing proposals =
for Cycle 8 that request to use the Atacama Compact Array (ACA) in =
stand-alone mode. Instructions on how to submit proposals can be found =
on the=C2=A0Cycle 8 Supplemental Call web page =
<https://almascience.nao.ac.jp/proposing/7m-array-supplemental-call>.

Users of any nationality or affiliation are invited to submit proposals =
before the deadline of 15:00 UT on Wednesday 6 October 2021.

Proposals submitted in the Supplemental Call will be peer reviewed using =
a distributed system in which each proposal team selects a designated =
reviewer to participate in the review process. The review process is =
described in detail in the Supplemental Call documentation =
(https://almascience.nao.ac.jp/proposing/7m-array-supplemental-call).

Proposals with targets at any RA will be considered, but those that can =
be observed in the LST range 20 to 10 h are particularly encouraged. =
Note that 7m-Array polarization observations are not offered at this =
Supplemental Call. In addition, time-constrained and =
Target-of-Opportunity (ToO) observations are not offered at this Call =
for Proposals. A minimum of 1500 h will be allocated each on the 7-m =
Array and the Total Power Array to proposals submitted at this Call.

Information about targets that are already in the observing queue can be =
found on the Duplicate Observations page =
(https://almascience.nao.ac.jp/proposing/duplications =
<https://almascience.nao.ac.jp/proposing/duplications>).

Users should note that the Supplemental Call proposal submission server =
will not be available for a few hours on September 27 because of =
scheduled maintenance. The precise downtimes will be noted on the =
Science Portal.=
