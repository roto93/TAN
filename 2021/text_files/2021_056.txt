*Colloquium on March 23*
Dear Colleagues,

*You are cordially invited to attend the Joint Colloquium which will be
held on Mar 23. *

The Joint Colloquium Series is organized by the NTU Physics Department,
Center for Condensed Matter Science (CCMS), Leung Center for Cosmology and
Particle Astrophysics (LeCosPA), Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and
Astrophysics (ASIAA), the Institute of Atomic and Molecular Sciences
(IAMS), and the NTNU Physics Department.

The idea is to have excellent speakers to give inspiring, informative, but
non-technical talks on the frontiers of Sciences.

Enclosed below is the information of the *Joint Colloquium on* *Mar 23*.

*ASIAA/CCMS/IAMS/LeCosPA/NTNU-Physics/NTU-Physics Joint Colloquium*

*Time: 3/23 (Tue) 14:20 *

*Place: Chin-Pao Yang Lecture Hall (Room 104), CCMS-New Physics Building*

*Speaker:* Professor Pisin Chen
 (Department of Physics, National Taiwan University)

*Topic: Everything you want to know about black holes=E2=80=94 2020 Nobel P=

*Abstract: The 2020 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Roger Penrose
=E2=80=9Cfor the discovery that black hole formation is a robust prediction=
 of the

tional waves
induced by coalescing binary black holes in 2016, which resulted in the
recognition by the 2017 Nobel Prize, and the Event Horizon Telescope
(EHT)=E2=80=99s observation of supermassive black hole in the galaxy M87, t=
he
existence of black holes, both theoretically and experimentally, are now
firmly established. What exactly is a black hole? How would its existence
in the universe affect its evolution? Black holes are fertile testing
grounds for the future development of modified and/or quantum gravity
theories. Would Hawking radiation result in the complete evaporation of a
black hole, or perhaps leave behind a remnant? Would it render the loss of
information? If not, how would the information be preserved? This question
has bothered theoretical physicists for more than 40 years without a
consensus. So would experimental means be able to shed some lights on this
paradox? In this talk, which will be pedagogical and colloquial, we will
review the history, the present state, and the future prospect of black
hole physics.  *
