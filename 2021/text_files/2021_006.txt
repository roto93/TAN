Speaker:    James Hung-Hsu Chan (ASIAA)
Topic:         Measuring accretion disk sizes of lensed quasars with microlensing time delay in multi-band light curves
Time:         1/11 (Monday) 12:15 - 13:15
Place:          R1203
Abstract:
I will present a new method to measure the color-dependent source size in lensed quasars using the microlensing time delays inferred from multi-band light curves. In practice, the relevant observable is the differential microlensing time delays between different bands. I will show from simulation using the facility as Vera C. Rubin Observatory that if this differential time delay between bands can be measured with a precision of 0.1 days in any given lensed image, the disk size can be recovered to within a factor of 2. If four lensed images are used, our method is able to achieve an unbiased source measurement within the error of the order of 20%, which is comparable with other techniques.
