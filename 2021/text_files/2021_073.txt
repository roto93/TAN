Purpose=EF=BC=9A
The Theoretical and Computational Astrophysics (TCA) Group at the =
National Center for Theoretical Sciences hosts its first undergraduate =
summer student program in 2021. This program aims to provide research =
experiences to undergraduate students and equip them with basic =
theoretical and computational skills. Students will be working under the =
supervision of domestic astrophysicists, on a wide range of topics from =
cosmology to planet formation. Frontier techniques in astronomy, problem =
solving skills, and numerical programing will be learned during this =
program. Participants are required to present their results publicly at =
the end of the program. Further continuation of the research project =
after the summer program can be possible.

Program=EF=BC=9A
July 05 - 07: The summer program will start with a 3-day workshop. =
Lectures on basic astrophysics and research overview will be provided. =
The final program will be released shortly before the beginning of the =
program. This training course is open to the general public.
July 01 - August 31 During the 2-month program, participants will work =
on their research topics with their supervisors at respective =
institutes. Local activities may be arranged by the supervisors.
August 30-31: Final public oral presentation.=
