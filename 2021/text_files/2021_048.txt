ALMA anticipates resuming science observations
Mar 15, 2021
https://almascience.nao.ac.jp/news/alma-anticipates-resuming-science-observations

Dear colleagues,

While the impact of COVID-19 continues to affect our lives around the world, ALMA staff have been moving forward on the long road toward recovering the Arrays and resuming science operations. The antennas in the 12-m Array and ACA are in the process of being powered up and inspected one by one to make them ready for science observations. Before we can resume science observations, a series of end-to-end tests need to be completed, where test observing projects follow the complete process from data acquisition to processing and quality assurance. The positive news at the moment is that these tests have successfully completed using a subset of antennas\.

Following the assessment on the safety and technical constraints in addition to the success of the end-to-end tests, ALMA anticipates restarting limited science operations in March 2021 with at least thirty-two and eight antennas on the 12-m and 7-m arrays, respectively. The array configuration is planned to be C43-4/C43-5, which will roughly correspond to the array when the operations were suspended in March 2020. Similar to the procedure for regular operations, projects in the Cycle 7 observing queue will be executed if suitable in terms of phase stability at the representative frequency and the achievable angular resolution with the available number of antennas. The execution time will be increased to account for the lower sensitivity of the reduced number of antennas in order to achieve the sensitivity requested by the Primary Investigator.

During the limited science operations phase, ALMA will also perform test observations on capabilities for future cycles and will continue the recovery of antennas to reach normal operations with the nominal numbers of antennas for Cycle 7 (see the Proposerâ€™s Guide). All activities, including the limited science operations, are conducted in accordance with an extensive set of safety protocols for managing the risk posed by the corona virus. As always, the health and safety of all ALMA staff is our top priority.

Status updates will be provided in the Science Portal on a regular basis. The ALMA Regional Centers also continue to provide support for ALMA users. If you have any questions, or have comments or concerns related to the situation at ALMA, please contact the ALMA Helpdesk at https://help.almascience.org/.

All ALMA staff wish you and your families to stay safe and healthy.

Dear all,

ALMA Cycle 8 2021 Call for Proposals is Now OPEN!

The ALMA Director, on behalf of the Joint ALMA Observatory and the partner organizations in East Asia, Europe, and North America, is pleased to announce that the ALMA Cycle 8 2021 Call for Proposals for scientific observations is now OPEN!

ALMA Cycle 8 2021 is currently scheduled for observations from October 2021 to September 2022. Users of any nationality or affiliation are invited to submit proposals before the deadline of 15:00 UT on Wednesday 21 April 2021.

For more information, please see https://almascience.nao.ac.jp/news/proposing/call-for-proposals

I would like to remind you that EA ARC is going to host two online meetings next week:

    ALMA Proposal Review Process for Cycle 8 2021
        March 23 (Tue) AM 8:30 - 9:00
        Zoom link: https://us02web.zoom.us/j/83928066526?pwd=R2t0ZlBVK0VkNDROL3E0cncxNEYxUT09

    EA community gathering with ALMA director
        March 24 (Wed) AM 8:30 - 9:30
        Zoom link: https://us02web.zoom.us/j/82235924824?pwd=Mnd5NGVCWW83d0JDMUQ3VDQ2OGZUUT09

Regarding the Q&A session in EA community gathering, you can send me your questions by March 21. Then we can collect questions in advance and send them to Sean before the event. Please make sure that the topic is for the Return to Operations status (not about details on proposal review process, proposal format for Cycle 8 2021 etc.).
 
Furthermore, the registration deadline for our ALMA Cycle 8 2021 Users Workshop is March 23!

Speaker:    [Pizza lunch] Marius Lehmann (ASIAA)
Topic:         Density Waves in Saturn's Rings
Time:         3/22 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:          R1203
Abstract:
I will briefly discuss the occurrence and detection of spiral density waves and the viscous overstability in Saturn's rings.
The former typically being excited by moons orbiting outside the rings, with typical wavelengths of some tens of kilometers,
the latter being a spontaneous instability of the ring flow, instigating axisymmetric density wave trains on a 100m scale.

The study of these wave structures can provide insights in principles of disk-satellite interaction and disk dynamics, and is therefore
of fundamental interest for astrophysical disks. For instance, the actions of moons that orbit interior and exterior to Saturnâ€™s rings bear many similar-
ities to those of planets forming in proto-planetary disks.

Furthermore, by utilizing a fluid description of the rings, the analysis of these wave structures in Saturnâ€™s rings can provide important physical pa-
rameters which are otherwise hard to constrain, such as the local mass surface density and the viscosity of the rings.



*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________
Speaker:    Yun-Ting Cheng (Caltech)
Topic:         Cosmology and Astrophysics with Intensity Mapping
Time:         3/24 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:          R1203
Abstract:
Intensity mapping (IM) has emerged as a promising tool to study the high redshift universe and the faint, diffuse extragalactic populations. Without resolving individual galaxies, IM measures the integrated light from all sources and uses that to statistically probe the emission properties of the sources as well as the underlying large-scale structure they trace. In this talk, I will cover several topics on intensity mapping technique. First, I will introduce line intensity mapping (LIM), which probes the 3D large-scale structure of the universe, and a [C II] LIM experiment, TIME, that I am currently working on. Next I will talk about two recent projects on studying extragalactic background light (EBL), the aggregate emission from all extragalactic sources throughout cosmic time. I will present our latest stacking analysis results on probing the extended stellar halo with CIBER, a sounding rocket experiment that measures the near-IR EBL. Finally, I will conclude with future !
 outlook for IM using SPHEREx, an upcoming all-sky near-infrared spectro-imaging survey.
