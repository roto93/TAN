Array Recovery Status Update
Jan 25, 2021
https://almascience.nao.ac.jp/news/array-recovery-status-update

Dear colleagues,
While the COVID-19 pandemic persists all around the world, ALMA staff at =
the JAO and in the regions continue to work towards bringing the array =
back online, with the ultimate goal to resume science operations and =
deliver high-quality science data to our users.
At this moment, the ALMA antennas are in the process of being powered up =
and inspected after having been stowed for about 300 days. The central =
local oscillator and the two correlators at the high site have =
successfully been started and the first antennas have been paired up to =
perform initial interferometric testing by science operations.
The Operations Support Facility (OSF) can now sustain a minimum number =
of ALMA staff. Nevertheless, the way towards science observations is =
still long and uncertain and heavily depends on issues that may be =
discovered as well as on the pandemic situation in Chile and the rest of =
the world.
The ALMA Regional Centres (ARCs) continue to assist ALMA users with the =
reduction and analysis of existing data through virtual face-to-face =
(f2f) support, in addition to answering the usual Helpdesk queries. If =
you have any questions, want to sign up for a virtual f2f visit, or have =
comments or concerns related to the situation at ALMA, please contact =
the ALMA Helpdesk at https://help.almascience.org =
<https://help.almascience.org/>.
All ALMA staff wish you and your families to remain safe and healthy.=
