Dear All,

ExoClock is a project by the ARIEL Ephemerides Working Group
https://www.exoclock.space/

1st ExoClock annual meeting is coming soon during the 25th & 26th of
September.
It is simply evening time for Taiwan during a weekend.

We are looking forward to seeing you all during our meeting and if you
have not registered, this is the link to register. We encourage you to
share the link with your communities or other interested people you may
know. The annual
meeting intends to bring together people interested in exoplanet research
- the more the merrier. The meeting is open to everyone including
observers, students, academics or just general public.

Subject: Research scholar position in Galaxy and Transient Astrophysics at NCHU
To: astro@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw

Dear all,

Applicants are invited for a research scholar position at the Department of
Physics at National Chung Hsing University (NCHU) to work in the groups of
Prof. Tetsuya Hashimoto and Prof. Yu-Yen Chang. This research scholar
position is an independent researcher without any duty, who can spend 100%
of his/her working time for research. The research scholar has his/her own
research grant from the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) of Taiwan.

Our current research is focused on galaxy formation and evolution,
supermassive black holes, fast radio bursts, gamma-ray bursts, and data
science. The successful candidate will contribute to research programs that
aim to study galaxy astrophysics and extra-galactic transients using
observational data. Candidates with relevant backgrounds and observational
expertise are encouraged to apply, although all exceptional candidates in
theoretical and numerical astrophysics will be considered.

Taiwan has access to world-leading telescope facilities such as
Subaru/Hyper Sprime-Cam, Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey Mapping Nearby Galaxies at APO (SDSS/MaNGA). Our
research team has also granted time for the Five-hundred-meter Aperture
Spherical Telescope to observe fast radio bursts. The successful candidate
can use such cutting-edge observational data to publish papers.

The Department of Physics at NCHU is committed to an inclusive, supportive
working environment that values equality, diversity, and internationality.

The appointment will be for three years with a minimum contract period of
one year, starting from 1st August 2022. Applicants should send (1) a cover
letter, (2) CV, (3) publication list, (4) research achievement (max. 2
pages), (5) research plan (max. 1 page), and (6) contact information for
two references as a single PDF to tetsuya@phys.nchu.edu.tw by Oct. 4, 2021.

After the initial selection by our research groups, the successful
candidates will be asked to prepare other forms of application, including
their budget plans. The final selection will be made by a committee
selected by the MOST.

For further information about our research groups, see the following URLs.
