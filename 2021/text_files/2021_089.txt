Subject: [REMINDER] [KVN2021B] Call for Proposals for the Korean VLBI Network (KVN) for the 2021B semester
Date: Fri, 21 May 2021 07:27:22 +0000

Dear colleagues,

This is a reminder that the proposal submission deadline for the Korean VLBI
Network (KVN) is approaching to June 1, 8:00 UT. Please refer also to the
following EAVN website for more details about the array.

1. KVN Call for Proposal (VLBI)
-----------------------------------------
Call for Proposals 2021B (KVN VLBI)
Proposal submission deadline: 2021 June 1, 08:00 UT
KVN website: https://kvn.kasi.re.kr
-----------------------------------------

The Korean VLBI Network (KVN) invites scientific proposals for VLBI observations
during the 2021B season from astronomers around the world. Observations of successful
proposals will be scheduled between 2021 September 1 and 2022 January 15. Proposals
should be submitted via the KVN website (https://kvn.kasi.re.kr) before the deadline
of UT 08:00 (KST 17:00) on 2021 June 1.


** Korean VLBI Network (KVN) **
The Korean VLBI Network (KVN) is a dedicated mm-VLBI network, operated by the Korea
Astronomy and Space Science Institute (KASI, https://www.kasi.re.kr). Its three 21m
radio telescopes are located around South Korea in Seoul, Ulsan, and Jeju Island.
The baseline lengths range from 305km to 476 km.

The simultaneous multi-frequency (22/43/86/129 GHz) observing mode in dual polarization
is available. Available data rates are 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16/32 Gbps (limited time and
shared risk observations in case of 16/32 Gbps, see the details in the KVN status
report). If requested in the proposals, the observing schedule can be allocated over
a year, until 2022 June 15. Proposers should use the KVN VLBI observing application
form and carefully follow the instructions on the KVN website. The scientific and
technical justification must be provided within 3 pages. Details of the information
and current status of the KVN can be found in the KVN status report on the KVN website
(http://kvn.kasi.re.kr). Proposals should be submitted via the KVN website.


** Note on the EATING VLBI observations**
According to the MoA between INAF (The Istituto Nazionale de Astrofisica) and KASI
up to 30 hours of observing time in VLBI mode are allocated to approved EATING VLBI
projects. These projects have to be submitted both to the Italian and Korean TACs
with the standard form selecting "EATING VLBI" mode in the project type. Approved
projects will be observed up to 30 hours/semester. Projects exceeding 30 hours will
be scheduled together with all other projects according to their relative grades.
PIs of these proposals must be associated with INAF or KASI. The detailed information
can be found at the website: http://www.radiotelescopes.inaf.it/proposal_main.html.

2. KVN Call for Proposal (Single Dish)
-----------------------------------------
Call for Proposals 2021B (Single Dish)
Proposal submission deadline: 2021 June 1, 08:00 UT
KVN website: https://kvn.kasi.re.kr
-----------------------------------------

The Korean VLBI Network (KVN) invites scientific proposals for single dish observations
for the 2021B season from Korean astronomical community. Observations of successful
proposals will be scheduled between 2021 September 1 and 2022 January 15. Proposals
should be submitted via the KVN website (http://kvn.kasi.re.kr) before the deadline
of UT 08:00 (KST 17:00) on 2021 June 1.

The Korean VLBI Network (KVN) is operated by Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute
(KASI, http://www.kasi.re.kr). Its three 21m radio telescopes are located in Seoul,
Ulsan and Jeju Island. Both spectral and continuum observation modes are supported.
Available frequency bands are K (18-26 GHz) and Q (35-50 GHz), extended-W (85-116 GHz),
and D (125-142 GHz), and the simultaneous multi-frequency observing mode is supported.
From 2021B season, the new backend system (GPU spectrometer) is implemented for shared
risk observations. For each KVN telescope, 300 hours of single dish observation time
is available for this call. Therefore, total available time for three KVN radio
telescopes is about 900 hours.

Proposers should use the KVN single dish application form and carefully follow the
instructions on the KVN website. The scientific and technical justification must be
provided within 3 pages. Details of the information and current status of the KVN
can be found in the KVN status report on the KVN website (http://kvn.kasi.re.kr).
