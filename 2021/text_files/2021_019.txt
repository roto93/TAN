Topic:         [Remote talk] H0 measurement from time-delay cosmography
Time:         2/3 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:          R1203
Abstract:
The Hubble constant is one of the most important parameters in
cosmology. Its value directly sets the age, the size, and the critical
density of the Universe. Despite the success of the flat LCDM model, the
derived Hubble constant from Planck data under the assumption of a flat
LCDM model has 4.4-sigma tension with the direct measurements. If this
tension is not due to the systematics, it may indicate the new physics
beyond the standard cosmological model. H_0 from time-delay lensing is
a powerful independent tool for addressing the H_0 tension since it is
independent of both Planck and the distance ladder. One way to do this
is to increase the number of high-quality lens systems since this allows
us to look for correlations and other effects due to systematics, and to do
hierarchical approaches to assess known systematic effects. Keck AO
data is not only the key component to increase the precision of H0
measurement but also provides systematic checks with the H_0 results
based on HST imaging. In this talk, I will present the current H_0
measurement, the systematic checks, and the future prospective of
TDCOSMO collaboration.
