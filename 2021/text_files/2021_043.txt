Dear all,

EA ARC is going to host two online meetings, EA community gathering with ALMA director and the new proposal review process for Cycle 8 2021.

As you know, the new proposal review system will start from Cycle 8 2021.
In the new proposal review process meeting, Adele Plunkett and Andrea Corvillon in the ALMA Proposal Handling Team will explain on the new proposal review system, including double anonymous, distributed peer review, and panel review.

In the EA community gathering, ALMA director Sean Dougherty is going to tell us the status of ALMA Observatory and the progress of return to operations.
