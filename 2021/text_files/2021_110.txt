Dear Colleague,


In light of a change of the array configuration schedule,
we announce a supplementary call for the SMA 2021A proposal:
http://sma.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/proposal.php

We are sorry about this short notice.
Please do not hesitate to let me know in case you have any questions.

Best wishes,
Baobab

ASIAA SMA Call for Proposals

Call for Standard Science Proposals

This opportunity is open to researchers in Taiwanese institutions including
ASIAA Hawaii.

Due to the recent decision of skipping the upcoming EXT1 array
configuration, which impacts the execution of the time-critical project, we
have decided to open the supplemental call for the 2021A proposals. People
who are affiliated with Taiwanese universities or research institutions
(including the staff who are physically located in Hawaii) are eligible for
proposing as PI. Student Thesis Proposals are also welcome.

*Observing period : 2021 Aug. 20 - 2021 Nov. 15 (2021A semester)*
*Proposal deadline: 2021 Aug. 10 (Tue.) 5:00 AM in Taiwan*

Priority of the projects approved through this supplementary call: Regular
projects will have lower priority than the already approved 2021A projects.
Student Thesis Projects can be exceptions, depending on the quality of the
proposals and the timeline for the students.

*Through this call, we expect to allocate 10 observing tracks. *
The tentative plan for the array configuration is:

SUB : 2021 Aug. 20 - Sept. 28 or Oct. 05
EXT2 : 2021 Oct. 1 or 8 - Oct. 26
VEX : 2021 Oct. 29 - Nov. 15

Please select (nighttime) target sources accordingly. For the proposers who
are going for SUB array configuration observations, it is recommended to
avoid the LST range for observing the M31 galaxy since it will be occupied
by a high-priority Large Scale Project.

Proposal Submission:Since this is very short notice, and since there will
be very limited time for the TAC to review the proposals, we have
simplified the format of the proposal to *1 page text (fontsize no smaller
than 11 pt) + 1 page figure (in PDF format).*

The proposers are recommended to just focus on what you will do and/or what
is the goal, omitting the general background introduction. This would be
assuming that the ASIAA TAC is more or less familiar with the science cases
of the Taiwan-side PIs, which is normally indeed the case. The proposals
will be reviewed by the TAC members in Taiwan. The TAC will consult the
experts when it is necessary.

*We will announce the results on August 15.* The PIs please be ready to
produce and upload your observing scripts.

Glen Petitpas has kindly created a specific interface for this
supplementary call for proposal (which is almost exactly the same as the
one that we have been using, i.e., you need to fill the basic information
and abstract, upload the Science Justification PDF, and then create your
observing time requests).* To submit the proposal, please contact Baobab
Liu via E-mail (at least a day ahead of the deadline).* We will direct you
to the interface. *To create a new Student Thesis Project, it is still
necessary to send a Notice of Intent (NoI) to Naomi and Baobab prior to the
deadline.*

Call for SMA-Taiwan Student Thesis Proposals

This opportunity is open to researchers in Taiwanese institutions including
ASIAA Hawaii.

The SMA-Taiwan (SMA-T) invites thesis programs requiring a substantial
amount of time spreading over multiple semesters. The proposals of the
students=E2=80=99 projects will be reviewed locally, i.e. separately from t=
he
regular proposals. The proposals request a bigger chunk of time (5+ tracks)
and the ones spread over the multi-semesters are also welcome.

Prospective PIs of the SMA-T key science projects need to submit a Notice
of Intent (NoI) by E-mail to Naomi and Baobab upon or ahead of the
submission on the SMA Observer Center. In the NoI, it is encouraged to
specify the names of the supervisor/student, and the expected Month/Year of
graduation.

Notice of Intent: E-mail to Naomi and Baobab upon or well ahead of the
submission on SMAOC
*Full submission: 2021 Aug. 10 (Tue.) 5:00 A.M. in Taiwan*
