Topic:         Evidence that 'Oumuamua is the ~45Myr-old product of a Molecular Cloud
Time:         1/25 (Monday) 12:15 - 13:15
Place:          R1203
Abstract:
The arrival of ISOs -- and specifically the appearance of 1I/'Oumuamua -- points to a significant number density of free-floating bodies in the Solar neighborhood. We study the details of 'Oumuamua's pre-encounter galactic orbit and find that it encountered our Sun at very nearly its maximum vertical and radial excursion relative to the galactic plane. 'Oumuamua's kinematics, moreover, strongly resemble those of nearby Young Associations. To obtain an order-of-magnitude a-priori age estimate, we compared 'Oumuamua's orbit to the orbits of 13,066 F-type stars drawn from the Gaia DR2, and with a simple diffusion model, we find tau_`O ~35 Myr. We then compare 'Oumuamua's orbit with the trajectories of nearby moving groups, confirming that its motion is consistent with its membership in the Carina and Columba associations, whose ages are 45 Myr. We conducted Monte Carlo simulations that trace the orbits of test particles ejected from the stars in the Carina and Columba associati!
 ons. We find that to achieve the inferred Pan-STARRS number density of 0.2 ISOs per au^3, the required ejection mass is ~ 100 M_{Jup} per known star within the associations. The Pan-STARRS observation is thus in significant tension with scenarios that posit 'Oumuamua's formation and ejection from a protostellar disk.

Topic:         Unraveling the complex nature of black holes and how they power explosive outflows with time-domain observations
Time:         1/26 (Tuesday) 10:30 - 11:30
Place:          R1203
Abstract:
Time-domain observations now offer a promising new way to study accretion and jet physics in X-ray binaries. Through detecting and characterizing rapid flux variability in these systems across a wide range of wavelength/energy bands (probing emission from different regions of the accretion flow and jet), we can measure properties that are difficult, if not impossible, to measure by traditional spectral and imaging methods (e.g., size scales, geometry, jet speeds, the sequence of events leading to jet launching). While variability studies in the X-ray bands are a staple in the X-ray binary community, there are many challenges that accompany such studies at longer wavelengths. However, with recent advances to observing techniques/instrumentation, the availability of new computational tools, and today's improved coordination capabilities, we are no longer limited by these challenges. In this talk, I will discuss new results from multi-wavelength fast timing observations of Cygn!
 us X-1 and MAXI J1820+070, highlighting how we can directly connect variability properties to internal jet physics. Additionally, I will discuss future prospects for obtaining more of these invaluable data sets, and the key role that next-generation instruments will play in driving new discoveries through this science.

Topic:         The Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope Project
Time:         1/27 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:          R1203
Abstract:
Astrophysical observations at (sub-)mm wavelengths (Î» from ~300 Î¼m to ~3mm) allow us to study the cold and dense material in the Universe, hence probing the formation of stars and planets, and the interstellar and circumgalactic medium within galaxies across cosmic time. The current generation of 10-meter-class single dish telescopes has delivered some of the first surveys at (sub-)mm wavelengths, allowing us to go far beyond the previously optical-biased view of the Universe. Follow-up observations with interferometers then revealed in exquisite detail the morphology and kinematics of such (sub-)mm sources, enabling tests and revisions of theoretical models for the formation and evolution of planets, stars, and galaxies.  However, it is now clear that without a transformative change in the capabilities of single-dish facilities in the 2030s, interferometers (like the ALMA observatory) will soon become source-starved. The current generation of 10-m class single dish telesc!
 opes, with their limited fields of view, spatial resolutions, and sensitivities, can only reveal the â€˜tip of the icebergâ€™ of the (sub-)mm source population, both for Galactic and extragalactic studies. These limitations cannot be fully mitigated by interferometers, which are all intrinsically affected by a low mapping speed and by the loss of diffuse extended signals.

The Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter telescope (AtLAST; http://atlast-telescope.org/;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020arXiv201107974K/abstract) project is a concept for a 50-meter diameter single dish observatory to be built near the ALMA site. With its extremely large field of view (the goal is ~ 2 degrees), spatial resolution (up to ~1.5â€ at 350 Î¼m), and sensitivity to both point sources and large-scale structures, AtLAST will be transformational for all fields of Astronomy in the 2030s. Here we will describe the recently approved EU Horizon2020 project to deliver a comprehensive design study for such a next-generation single-single dish facility.  Beyond the EU, AtLAST would welcome an international consortium, and is beginning to garner broad support, with support from the Japanese 50-meter Large Submm Telescope community as well as many US Astro2020 decadal and Canadian Long Range Plan 2020 science case submissions.
