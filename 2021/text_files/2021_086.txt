***************************************************
Call for Proposals for the East Asian VLBI Network (EAVN)
for the 2021B semester
Proposal submission deadline: 2021 June 1 (Tue.), 8:00 UT
EAVN website: https://eavn.kasi.re.kr/
***************************************************

--- Major revisions from the 2021A semester ---
* Kunming 40-m telescope joins in EAVN open-use program. EAVN will be operated
  using 15 telescopes (VERA, KVN, Tianma, Sheshan, Nanshan, Kunming, Nobeyama,
  Takahagi, Hitachi, and Yamaguchi) in the 2021B semester.
* Total approved time for target of opportunity (ToO) observation is limited to
  be 100 hours.
* No upper limit on the total request time for one proposal is set for KaVA 7
  telescopes, while the total request time is set for non-KaVA telescopes.
* Detailed condition on the time allocation of Nobeyama 45-m telescope is defined.
* EAVN abolishes accepting a proposal requesting one-year-long observations from
  the 2021B semester.
-----------------------------------------------


*** Overview ***
We invite proposals for open-use observations with the East Asian VLBI Network
(EAVN), which is the international collaborative VLBI array between China, Korea,
and Japan. In the 2021B semester, 15 telescopes (VERA 4 x 20 m, KVN 3 x 21 m,
Tianma 65 m, Sheshan 25 m, Nanshan 26 m, Kunming 40 m, Nobeyama 45 m, Takahagi 32 m,
Hitachi 32 m, and Yamaguchi 32 m) participate in the EAVN open-use program.


*** Observing mode ***
EAVN provides opportunities of VLBI observations with a data recording rate of
1 Gbps (total bandwidth of 256 MHz and with single polarization at 6.7, 22, and
43 GHz. Dual-frequency (22 and 43 GHz) simultaneous observation system can also
be used for EAVN observations at KaVA and Nobeyama, while the observing term in
which the system is available will be determined. Details of available observing
mode can be found in the EAVN Status Report on the EAVN website.


*** Telescope time and array configuration ***
The total available observation time for EAVN is up to 500 hours in the 2021B
semester, while the available observing time for individual EAVN telescopes are
different. Especially, detailed conditions on the time allocation of Nobeyama
45-m telescope are defined in the 2021B semester. Please refer to the EAVN status
report on the EAVN website for more details. All EAVN observations will be allocated
between 2021 September 1 and 2022 January 15.

EAVN accepts a request for usage of sub-array configuration (KaVA 7 telescopes
and additional telescopes from non-KaVA stations). There are several conditions
of the antenna combination depending on the observing frequency. Further details
about the sub-array configuration are shown in the EAVN status report.

In the 2021B semester, no limitation of the maximum request time for a single
proposal is determined in case of usage of only KaVA 7 stations, while one can
request for the maximum total telescope time of 50 hours for Tianma/Sheshan and
Nanshan, and 36 hours for Takahagi, Hitachi, Yamaguchi, and Kunming. Total telescope
time of 24 hours for Nobeyama can be requested for a proposal. EAVN abolishes
accepting a proposal requesting one-year-long observations from the 2021B semester.
One should thus submit a proposal by a submission deadline for each semester.


*** Target of opportunity ***
EAVN accepts target of opportunity (ToO) proposals. Note that Nobeyama and Kunming
cannot be included for ToO proposals. It is strongly recommended that ToO proposals
(especially expected ToO) are submitted during the regular CfP, while unexpected
or urgent ToO can be submitted as Director's Discretionary Time (DDT) proposals
at any time. Note that the total approved time for ToO observation in the 2021B
semester is limited to be 100 hours for ToO proposals for both expected and
unexpected events.

ToO proposals must address clear triggering criteria to initiate an observation.
ToOs are valid for one year after it is approved. ToO proposals for DDT should
follow the same way of regular call and should be submitted via the EAVN website.


*** Proposal submission ***
Proposals should be submitted via the EAVN website. Proposal submission deadline
is 2021 June 1 (Tue.), 8:00 UT. Please refer to the EAVN status report for detailed
information about the proposal format. The designated cover sheet form can be
downloaded from the EAVN websites.


*** Acknowledgment ***
All EAVN users are asked to specify the acknowledgment to EAVN in their publications.
A template for the acknowledgment can be found in the EAVN status report.

Date: Fri, 21 May 2021 07:27:22 +0000

Dear colleagues,

This is a reminder that the proposal submission deadline for the Korean VLBI
Network (KVN) is approaching to June 1, 8:00 UT. Please refer also to the
following EAVN website for more details about the array.

1. KVN Call for Proposal (VLBI)
-----------------------------------------
Call for Proposals 2021B (KVN VLBI)
Proposal submission deadline: 2021 June 1, 08:00 UT
KVN website: https://kvn.kasi.re.kr
-----------------------------------------

The Korean VLBI Network (KVN) invites scientific proposals for VLBI observations
during the 2021B season from astronomers around the world. Observations of successful
proposals will be scheduled between 2021 September 1 and 2022 January 15. Proposals
should be submitted via the KVN website (https://kvn.kasi.re.kr) before the deadline
of UT 08:00 (KST 17:00) on 2021 June 1.


** Korean VLBI Network (KVN) **
The Korean VLBI Network (KVN) is a dedicated mm-VLBI network, operated by the Korea
Astronomy and Space Science Institute (KASI, https://www.kasi.re.kr). Its three 21m
radio telescopes are located around South Korea in Seoul, Ulsan, and Jeju Island.
The baseline lengths range from 305km to 476 km.

The simultaneous multi-frequency (22/43/86/129 GHz) observing mode in dual polarization
is available. Available data rates are 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16/32 Gbps (limited time and
shared risk observations in case of 16/32 Gbps, see the details in the KVN status
report). If requested in the proposals, the observing schedule can be allocated over
a year, until 2022 June 15. Proposers should use the KVN VLBI observing application
form and carefully follow the instructions on the KVN website. The scientific and
technical justification must be provided within 3 pages. Details of the information
and current status of the KVN can be found in the KVN status report on the KVN website
(http://kvn.kasi.re.kr). Proposals should be submitted via the KVN website.


** Note on the EATING VLBI observations**
According to the MoA between INAF (The Istituto Nazionale de Astrofisica) and KASI
up to 30 hours of observing time in VLBI mode are allocated to approved EATING VLBI
projects. These projects have to be submitted both to the Italian and Korean TACs
with the standard form selecting "EATING VLBI" mode in the project type. Approved
projects will be observed up to 30 hours/semester. Projects exceeding 30 hours will
be scheduled together with all other projects according to their relative grades.
PIs of these proposals must be associated with INAF or KASI. The detailed information
can be found at the website: http://www.radiotelescopes.inaf.it/proposal_main.html.

2. KVN Call for Proposal (Single Dish)
-----------------------------------------
Call for Proposals 2021B (Single Dish)
Proposal submission deadline: 2021 June 1, 08:00 UT
KVN website: https://kvn.kasi.re.kr
-----------------------------------------

The Korean VLBI Network (KVN) invites scientific proposals for single dish observations
for the 2021B season from Korean astronomical community. Observations of successful
proposals will be scheduled between 2021 September 1 and 2022 January 15. Proposals
should be submitted via the KVN website (http://kvn.kasi.re.kr) before the deadline
of UT 08:00 (KST 17:00) on 2021 June 1.

The Korean VLBI Network (KVN) is operated by Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute
(KASI, http://www.kasi.re.kr). Its three 21m radio telescopes are located in Seoul,
Ulsan and Jeju Island. Both spectral and continuum observation modes are supported.
Available frequency bands are K (18-26 GHz) and Q (35-50 GHz), extended-W (85-116 GHz),
and D (125-142 GHz), and the simultaneous multi-frequency observing mode is supported.
From 2021B season, the new backend system (GPU spectrometer) is implemented for shared
risk observations. For each KVN telescope, 300 hours of single dish observation time
is available for this call. Therefore, total available time for three KVN radio
telescopes is about 900 hours.

Proposers should use the KVN single dish application form and carefully follow the
instructions on the KVN website. The scientific and technical justification must be
provided within 3 pages. Details of the information and current status of the KVN
can be found in the KVN status report on the KVN website (http://kvn.kasi.re.kr).
