Dear all,

ALMA Cycle 8 2021 Call for Proposals is Now OPEN!

The ALMA Director, on behalf of the Joint ALMA Observatory and the partner organizations in East Asia, Europe, and North America, is pleased to announce that the ALMA Cycle 8 2021 Call for Proposals for scientific observations is now OPEN!

ALMA Cycle 8 2021 is currently scheduled for observations from October 2021 to September 2022. Users of any nationality or affiliation are invited to submit proposals before the deadline of 15:00 UT on Wednesday 21 April 2021.

I would like to remind you that EA ARC is going to host two online meetings next week:

Regarding the Q&A session in EA community gathering, you can send me your questions by March 21. Then we can collect questions in advance and send them to Sean before the event. Please make sure that the topic is for the Return to Operations status (not about details on proposal review process, proposal format for Cycle 8 2021 etc.).
