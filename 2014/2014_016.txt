Session Title: Studies of Small Bodies in the Solar System and Insights into Planetary System Formation

Session Description

The Small Bodies and Planetary System Formation Session will address
the latest studies of primitive bodies in the solar system. Asteroids,
comets, small satellites, trans-Neptunian objects, meteors, and
interplanetary dust particles are remnants of the early solar
system. These objects give us clues to the formation of planetary
systems. Scientific investigations include, but are not limited to,
physical characterization, understanding of the origin and the
evolution of the solar system, and the formation processes and
configuration of other planetary systems.

Recently, synergies between in-situ measurements by spacecraft,
laboratory experiments and analysis, ground and space-based
observational studies, together with theoretical and numerical studes
are leading to significant progress. These studies inform research
into the formation of planetary systems.
