NTHU astronomy colloquium - Friday, November 14 2014, 14:00-15:00, R620

Speaker: Claudio Grillo (DARK)
Title:The dark-matter haloes of massive galaxies and clusters of galaxies

Abstract:
The physics of gravitational light deflection, or gravitational lensing,
offers a great variety of applications in several fields of astrophysics.
In particular, in the strong lensing regime, observations of multiple
images of background sources created by intervening mass concentrations
provide a unique opportunity of measuring very precisely the total mass of
these intervening lenses. The combination of strong gravitational lensing
and stellar population models has turned out to be an invaluable tool to
disentangle the luminous and dark-matter components in the inner regions of
distant galaxies and clusters of galaxies. I will show how, by using these
techniques on unprecedented data obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope
and the Very Large Telescope, we have been able to investigate the
properties of the dark-matter haloes and subhaloes of massive lens
early-type galaxies and galaxy clusters in the CASSOWARY and CLASH surveys.
