Dear Prof Kuan,

Could you help to forward the following letter to TAN?

Cheers,

Dear CFHT-T PIs and OIR Community,

I am writing this message on behalf of the CFHT-T time allocation committee.

The 2015A semester has seen a high demand for CFHT observing time from
the Taiwanese community, with an oversubscription rate of nearly 4.
While it is not possible to fully satisfy everbody's needs, the CFHT-T
TAC had worked hard to give most of the programs at least some
observing time to obtain data that can be used to further develop
the science cases for better future proposals.  With the great help
from external referees, the TAC will also provide comprehensive reports
to PIs to help them improve their proposals.

During the review processes, the TAC identified several common
problems in our CFHT proposals.  We list them here so the PIs can
avoid them in the future.

1. No justification or no mention of sample sizes.
How many targets/candidates do you expect to observe/discover?
Why do you need this many?  Lack of justification of these issues usually
leads to reduced time allocation or even the rejection of the proposal.

2. No justification of sensitivity.  What's the limiting magnitude
(AB or Vega mag?) or flux you need to reach?  At how many sigma?
How is this sensitivity requirement connected to your science goals?

3. Unclear sensitivity estimate.  Please state the required seeing
condition, airmass, sky background, spectral resolution, integration
time, and all other important instrumental setup parameters used for your
sensitivity estimate.  Without these details, the CFHT technical
reviewers may not be able to reproduce the required observing time estimate,
and this will reduce the credibility of the proposal.  From semester 15B,
CFHT is very likely to require attachments of ETC screenshots in the
proposal form, which should help a lot.  In case this does not happen,
please provide sufficient details about the time estimates in the
technical justification section.

4. Inaccurate estimate of overheads. For most MegaCam and WIRCam
observations, CFHT only charges the readout overheads. They are
10 sec per exposure for WIRCam and 40 sec per exposure for
MegaCam.  CFHT does NOT charge filter exchange time to PIs.
Only when nodding is used with WIRCam, there is an additional 60-sec
overhead charged to PIs each time when the telescope moves to
and from the offset sky position.  With Espadons, the overheads
charged to the PI are 40, 60, and 85 sec, for fast, normal, and slow
readout modes, respectively.  These include both the readout and
operational overheads.  Therefore, for all the above observations,
PIs need to figure out how many exposures are needed by taking into
account the total integration time, and the integration time for
each single exposure (which strongly depends on instrumental setup,
filter band, and sky condition).

5. Inappropriate proposal length.  CFHT only has simple page limits
(3 page science plus 2 page technique), with no further requirements
on font size and format.  However, PIs should not fill the pages
will small text and crowded figures.  This often confuses/irritates
readers.  On the other hand, please also make good use of the pages to
provide sufficient scientific arguments and technical details.  Short
proposals are easy to read, but lack of necessary details also irritates
readers especially when there is still plenty of available space.
Please use your own judgement on what length will be appropriate.

Finally, the TAC requires PIs who resubmit previous proposals to
revise their proposals addressing the referee reports as well as comments
from the TAC, and to include a brief progress update or preliminary
results if possible. It is hard to predict the oversubscription rates
in future semesters, and only the quality of a proposal can guarantee
a success in obtaining observing time.

Please feel free to contac the TAC should you have questions about the
review process or about how to improve your proposal.

Sincerely yours,
Wei-Hao Wang
