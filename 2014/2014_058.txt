    Title:  Multi-wavelength Studies on
            Be/X-ray Binaries

    Abstract:
Be/X-ray Binaries are a major subclass of high mass X-ray binaries.
The compact object moves in a moderately eccentric orbit around the
Be star in the system. There are two different discs in the Be/X-ray
binary, a circumstellar disk around the Be star and an accretion disk
around the compact object. In this talk, I will present our optical
spectroscopic and photometric observational results on several Be/X-ray
binaries, such as A 0535+26, MXB 0656-072, X Per, and LS V+44 17.  An
anti-correlation between the optical brightness and the strength of the
H emission was observed: when the optical brightness showed a decrease,
the intensity of the H emission displayed an obvious increase. This
anti-correlation is interpreted as the result of the mass ejection from
the Be star. The X-ray outbursts of the Be/X-ray binaries might be
connected with the mass ejections from the Be star.

        Tea/Discussion Time is followed !
                  All Welcome !!
