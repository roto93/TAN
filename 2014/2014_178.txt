=3D=3D=3D 2014 LOT Users Meeting =3D=3D=3D

Date: 19 Nov 2014
Time: 13:30
Place: Room 1013, Chien-Shiung Building (Science Building 4)=EF=BC=8C Natio=
nal
Central University

Topics to be discussed:

* Observing at LOT: users (esp students) are encouraged to go to Lulin
Observatory and run their own observations (and not asking for queue
observing unless it is really necessary). Users that willing to do so will
have higher priority to be allocated in next Semester.

* Suggestions for improving the time-allocation process in this Semester,
ToO handling, LOT observing calendar etc.

* Data download from FTP: comments? suggestions? disk array in future?

* Status of current or past 3-years LOT data: the users are encouraged to
give 1-2 slides presentation about the status of their LOT data. E.g, are
the data being used in recent publication? Are the data currently under
process/analyze?

* Mode of operation for next Semester, 2015A: continue current mode for
internal use only? back to before and issue call-of-proposal? or mixture of
both?

* Calling for "survey" or "key-project" type projects: one possibility is
allocate a fraction of time (50%?) to "survey" or "key-project" type
projects that need substantial amount of observing time (required to submit
status reports) and expected to have a number of publications. The use
Hiyoyu and TRIPOL2 in these projects will be encouraged.

* LOT user fee: since the electric bill and LOT operation fee is increasing
every year, LOT users are encourage to "donate" the LOT user fee (currently
it is voluntary), and request such fee in their MOST proposal (due 12/31
this year).

* Engineering time: starting Jan 2015, default engineering time will be the
full moon night in every month. Additional 1-2 nights may be needed
depending on the maintenance jobs.

* Problems encountered when observing with LOT?

* General suggestions for LOT (operations, time-allocation, instrumentation
etc) and feedback.

Potential LOT users who attend this meeting, willing to observe at LOT
and/or presenting a status report of their LOT data will have higher
priority to be allocated in next Semester (2015A).
