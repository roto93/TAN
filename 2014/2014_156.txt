------------------------------------------------

The Earth-Life Science Institute (ELSI) will be holding its 3rd =
International Symposium on January 13-15, 2015, in Tokyo, Japan.

The main theme of ELSI's 3rd International Symposium is the fundamental =
question: "Is there life in the Universe, outside Earth?"  We still =
don't know the answer, but there is a good chance that the answer will =
be found within our lifetime.  Robotic exploration within the solar =
system, as well as observations of planets circling other stars, may =
soon give us more tentative hints, and possibly even convincing =
evidence, of extraterrestrial forms of life.  During the 3-day =
symposium, we will address three questions, respectively: 1) which =
planets seem fit as potential cradles of life; 2) what can we say about =
the likely properties of more universal forms of life, different from =
the one specific example we know on Earth; and 3) how can we best try to =
find signs of life elsewhere.
