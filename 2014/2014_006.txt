Arizona Radio Observatory: Call for Proposals (Spring 2014)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Astronomers in Taiwan,

Observing proposals from members of the University Consortium of ALMA-Taiwan
(UCAT) and ASIAA for the 10-meter Sub-Millimeter Telescope (SMT), located on
Mount Graham, Arizona, of the Arizona Radio Observatory (ARO) are being
solicited for the period 01 February 2014 to 30 June 2014. The proposal
deadline of UCAT/ASIAA for this 2014 spring semester is set on February 07,
2014 (Friday).

The SMT currently supports a dual-polarization, 1-mm receiver (215-280 GHz)
with ALMA Band 6 sideband-separating (SBS) mixers, a dual-polarization 0.8-mm
(320-370 GHz) receiver, and a 0.4-mm (602-720 GHz) dual-polarization receiver
with ALMA Band 9 mixers. A new 0.6-mm (420-500 GHz) dual-polarization receiver
incorporating sideband-separating mixers will be available as well. The SMT
control system supports both dual-polarization ("2 IF mode"), and
dual-polarization, dual sideband observations ("4 IF mode"), as well as OTF
mapping. 

Remote observing is available at http://aro.as.arizona.edu/remote/remote.htm.
Graduate-student participation is especially encouraged. For further information
about remote observing and other operational questions, contact Tom Folkers,
Operations Manager tfolkers@email.arizona.edu.

Proposers should consult the ARO website (http://aro.as.arizona.edu/) for
technical specifications and to download updated proposal templates. Proposers
are required to list on the cover sheet their requested observing blocks (LST
ranges), dates on which they are not available to observe, and dates in which
sources in those observing blocks are within the Sun-avoidance zone (44 degrees
at the SMT).

Proposals should consist of:
1.  A proposal Cover Sheet, obtainable at http://aro.as.arizona.edu/proposals.
2.  A brief scientific and technical justification (no more than 2 pages).
3.  A source list with observing time requirements and justification, and/or
    tables, figures and references (no more than 1 page in total).
4.  Observers that plan to observe remotely must supply fixed IP address(es) of
    the computer(s) that will be used during observing on the cover sheet of the
    proposal.

Electronic submissions will be accepted in PDF format ONLY. Scheduling of
successful proposals will be done according to availability of the receivers
requested. The final proposal pdf file should be emailed to kuan@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw
by midnight (23:59 pm CST) February 07, 2014 (Friday).


Kind regards,
