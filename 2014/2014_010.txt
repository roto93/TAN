                        (ASROC2014)

  Experimental Forest of National Taiwan University, NanTou
                        May 23 - 25, 2014

The 2014 Scientific Assembly of the Astronomical Society of the Republic of
China (ASROC2014) will be held at the Experimental Forest of National Taiwan
University on May 23 (Friday) - 25 (Sunday), 2014. This is the annual event for
all astronomers and astrophysicists in Taiwan to demonstrate their most recent
discoveries and observations, to report their latest research results and to
exchange ideas, also to organize cooperation when desirable. Oral presentations
and conference posters in all areas of astronomy and astrophysics are solicited.
ASROC2014 is also an excellent venue for students, in particular graduate
students, to present their research findings or progress from their thesis
studies.

    The meeting will include plenary talks, scientific and educational
sessions, poster presentation, and a business meeting. The featured plenary
speakers are 1) Prof. Debra Fischer of Yale University and a Fellow of the
American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Prof. Fisher is a well-known astronomer
and one of the pioneers in extrasolar planet search. Prof. Fischer has
discovered hundreds of extrasolar planets including the first known multiple
planet system in 1999. Prof. Fischer also led an international consortium
searching for extrasolar gas giant planets and detected more than 30 new hot
Jupiters orbiting metal-rich stars. 2) Prof. Neal Evans II, the Edward Randall,
Jr. Centennial Professor in Astronomy of University of Texas at Austin. Prof.
Evans is the world leading expert in low-mass star formation and he has
published more than 250 refereed papers including a review article on star
formation in the Annual Review of Astronomy & Astrophysics. Recently Prof. Evans
used the Spitzer and Herschel infrared/submillimeter space telescopes to study
individual low-mass stars and their planetary systems. The titles of plenary
talks by Prof. Fischer and Prof. Evans are "How will we find another Earth?"
and "Progress in Understanding the Formation of Low Mass Stars," respectively.

    ASROC2014 website will be ready in late-January; on-line registration
will also be available. Participants of the scientific assembly should submit
their abstracts and register on-line. A registration fee of NT$1,000 (NT$800
for students) should be paid on site.

    The Astronomical Society cordially invites you to participate in this
annual event with all the many interesting and exciting activities. For more
