*** Special Seminar
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Chien-Ting Chen (Dartmouth)
Topic:        The links between AGNs and the star formation in their host galaxies
Time:        2/12 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
The connection between star formation in galaxies and the growth of their super-massive black holes (SMBHs) is an important and still uncertain aspect of galaxy evolution that has seen dramatic progress with the launch of Herschel. I will present our recent studies using Herschel and a range of multiwavelength data in the Boç¹¹tes field, which have uncovered a global correlation between galactic SFR and the average SMBH growth in far-IR selected star-forming galaxies. These results are consistent with a simple picture that the growths of SMBHs and galaxies are closely linked over galaxy evolution time scale. Using the datasets from the same survey region, I will also present evidence for a link between nuclear obscuration and host galaxy star formation in powerful quasars, which supports a scenario in which obscuration in quasars might be associated with the star-forming dust in the host galaxies.

Topic:        The link between observed velocity dispersion in globular clusters and three-body stability
Time:        2/13 (Thursday) 13:15 - 14:30
Place:        R1108
Abstract:
The velocity dispersion profile in globular clusters (GCs) is explained here without having to rely on dark matter or a modification of Newtonian dynamics (MOND). The flattening of the velocity dispersion at large radii in certain Milky Way GCs, or lack thereof, is explained by recourse to the stability of the three-body problem in Newtonian dynamics. The transition radius between stable and unstable orbits for a star in a globular cluster is used to predict where the velocity dispersion profile flattens in GCs, given known orbital parameters of the GC-galaxy orbit. Comparison between these predictions to those using MOND is made using published observational data for the velocity dispersion as a function of radius of 15 Milky Way globular clusters with approximately known orbital parameters.
