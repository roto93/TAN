Discovery of a Strong Lensing Galaxy Embedded in a Cluster at z = 1.62

We identify a strong lensing galaxy in the cluster IRC 0218 that is
spectroscopically confirmed to be at z=1.62, making it the
highest-redshift strong lens galaxy known.  The lens is one of the two
brightest cluster galaxies and lenses a background source galaxy into
an arc and a counterimage.  With Hubble Space Telescope grism and
Keck/LRIS spectroscopy, we measure the source redshift to be z=2.26.
Using HST imaging in ACS/F475W, ACS/F814W, WFC3/F125W, and WFC3/F160W,
we model the lens mass distribution with an elliptical power-law
profile and account for the effects of the cluster halo and nearby
galaxies. The Einstein radius is R_E = 0.38" and the total enclosed
mass is 1.8x10^11 M_sun.  We estimate that the cluster environment
contributes ~10% of this total mass.  Assuming a Chabrier IMF, the
dark matter fraction within R_E is f_DM ~ 0.3, while a Salpeter IMF is
marginally inconsistent with the enclosed mass (f_DM ~ -0.3).    The
source has at least one bright compact region offset from the source
center.  Emission from Lyman alpha and [OIII] are likely to probe
different regions in the source.  This unique system is one of only a
handful that allows us to study the mass structure of early-type
galaxies at z > 1.  Current and future surveys, such as the Hyper
Suprime-Cam survey, may uncover more of these high-z lens galaxies to
better understand their physical properties and how they evolve over
time.

********************************
Call for Proposals of KaVA ( KVN and VERA Array )
Deadline;  November 6, 2014, 08:00 UT.
*********************************

Dear Colleagues.

We invite proposals for the open use observations of the KaVA, a joint VLBI array
of the KVN (Korean VLBI Network) and the VERA (VLBI exploration of Radio
Astrometry). The joint array consists of three 21-m KVN telescopes and
four 20-m VERA telescopes, with baseline lengths ranging from 300 km to 2300 km.

Same as the last semester, this open-use call will be based on risk-share, and
provide VLBI observations at 22GHz and 43GHz for astronomers who are affiliated
to universities or institutes in Korea, Japan, China and Taiwan. 
We can support astronomers who are not familiar with VLBI technique 
in the preparation of proposals, scheduling, and data analysis. Proposers from 
China and/or Taiwan are requested to include at least one collaborator from 
VERA or KVN. If it is difficult to find the collaborator from VERA or KVN, we can
support to find them. 
The contact address for the support is kavaprop (at-mark) kasi.re.kr. 

Observations will be conducted with single polarization (LCP) and 1-Gbps data rate.
The total available observation time is up to 250 hours and the observations will be
scheduled between January 15, 2015 and June 15, 2015.
The maximum observing time per proposal is 48 hours during the observing period. 
The deadline of submission is November 6, 2014.  More detailed
information of the KaVA call-for-proposal can be found from

http://kava.kasi.re.kr/contents/proposal_info.php?mid=020101

If you have any questions, please send an email to kavaprop (at-mark) kasi.re.kr

Sincerely,

                        Jongsoo Kim
                        Director of Radio Astronomy Division, KASI

Dear Colleagues.

I attached herewith an announcements of the call-for-proposals of 
the VERA for 2015A season.  
Please distribute this announcement to your community and encourage 
people to write proposals.  

Thank you very much for your cooperation.

Best regards,

********************************
Call for Proposals of VERA
Deadline;  November 6, 2014, 08:00 UT.
*********************************

We wish to inform you call for proposals of VERA; VLBI exploration of
Radio Astrometry.  VERA is a Japanese VLBI network, which has
four 20-m  stations in Japanese archipelago and aims phase referencing
and astrometry observations with 2-beam system.  It makes simultaneous
observations of two objects with the 22-GHz and 43-GHz bands.
VERA, Kashima-34m and Nobeyama-45m network mode is also available.  
Available observation time is up to 200 hours during the observation period 
from January 15th, 2015 to June 15th, 2015.
Although it is limited to VERA array and  a single-beam mode, 
the 6.7 GHz ( C-band ) is opened on shared-risk basis. 

We encourage the submission of many proposals.
For further details please see below,

Speaker:    James Chan (NTU/ASIAA)
Topic:         CHITAH: Strong-Gravitational-Lens Hunter in Imaging Surveys
Time:         10/13 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:         R1203


*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Albert Kong (NTHU)
Topic:         Spider-man vs Transformers: Hunting for the missing black widows
Time:         10/15 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
Six years of observations with the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope
have revolutionized our knowledge of the gamma-ray pulsar population,
leading to the discovery of over 40 millisecond pulsars (MSPs) by
combining with deep radio observations. With this growing number of
gamma-ray emitting MSPs and by combining multi-wavelength observing
facilities, it is now possible to study their properties as a
population. In this talk, I will review recent discoveries of
"transformer" MSPs that switch between low-mass X-ray binaries and
radio MSPs. I will also discuss how multi-wavelength observations
reveal a new population of black widow/redback MSPs that provide new
insights into MSP's emission mechanisms.



*** Special Seminar ***
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Bi-Qing For (Univ. of Western Australia)
Topic:         The gaseous features of the Magellanic System
Time:         10/14 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
In this talk, I will present the results of a study of high velocity clouds in the Magellanic Stream and the Leading Arm. The study uses the Galactic All-Sky Survey (GASS) and a newly conducted survey data of the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). The properties of HVCs in the two regions are compared and contrasted in order to study the different mechanisms shaping their structure and evolution. I will also present new discoveries from the study and report ongoing/future surveys on the Magellanic Clouds with state-of-the-art telescopes.
