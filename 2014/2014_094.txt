*** Colloquium
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Neal Evans (U. Texas at Austin)
Topic:        Star Formation: From Far to Near
Time:        5/28 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
I will discuss developments in what controls star formation, zooming in
from extragalactic perspectives to studies within galaxies, within the
Milky Way, and finally to nearby molecular clouds. Relations 
between gas and star formation (e.g., Kennicutt-Schmidt laws)
will be considered, along with the role of dense gas and threshold
effects.


*** Special Seminar
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Sze-leung Cheung (International Outreach Coordinator, IAU Office for Astronomy Outreach)
Topic:        International Year of Light 2015, Public Naming of Exoplanets and IAU Office for Astronomy Outreach
Time:        5/26 (Monday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
The International Astronomical Union (IAU) Office for Astronomy Outreach (OAO) is an IAU new office hosted at National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ) at Tokyo. After the International Year of Astronomy 2009, IAU decided to establish the OAO to coordinate the international astronomical outreach efforts. Two major campaigns that OAO are running are the International Year of Light 2015 and the Public Naming of Exoplanets. IAU is one of the supporting organization of the International Year of Light 2015 (IYL2015), and one of the IYL2015 cornerstone project is “Cosmic Light”, which connect astronomy to light. OAO is the central hub of coordination for the Cosmic Light cornerstone. On the other hand, IAU has also decided to name exoplanets, however, using a different approach than the naming of solar system bodies like asteroids or comets, the naming of exoplanet will involve public voting and proposal nominations from public organizations including planetariums.
