MEETING TITLE:
Cosmic Dust

VENUE:
Tokyo Skytree Town Campus of Chiba Institute of Technology
8F solamachi, Tokyo Skytree Town(R)
1-1-2 Oshiage, Sumida-ku, Tokyo 131-0045, JAPAN
http://www.it-chiba.ac.jp/skytree/index_en.html

DATE:
Monday, August 17 – Friday, August 21, 2015

OBJECTIVES:
This series of Cosmic Dust meetings aims at finding a consensus among 
experts on the formation and evolution of cosmic dust: where it comes 
from and where it goes. The meeting is organized by dust freaks who are 
very enthusiastic not only to make the goal achievable but also to 
establish a dust community across every scientifically relevant 
discipline for the development of cosmic dust research. For this reason, 
the primary objective of the meeting is to bring together professionals 
who deal with cosmic dust as well as provide an opportunity for 
participants to develop human relations and interactions among themselves.

SCOPE:
All kinds of cosmic dust such as
• intergalactic dust
• circumnuclear dust
• interstellar dust
• protoplanetary disk dust
• debris disk dust
• cometary dust
• interplanetary dust
• circumplanetary dust
• stellar nebular condensates
• presolar grains
• micrometeorites
• meteoroids
• meteors
• regolith particles
• planetary aerosols
are the subject of discussion. The meeting is open for any aspects of 
dust research by means of different methods of studies (in-situ and 
laboratory measurements, astronomical observations, laboratory and 
numerical simulations, theoretical modeling, data analyses, etc.). All 
dust-related topics, for example, the formation of molecules and their 
reactions on and their desorption from the surface of dust particles, 
are also welcome. Publishing the proceedings of this meeting is 
currently planned as a special issue of a peer-reviewed journal, while 
paper submission to the proceedings is not obligatory.

ADMISSIONS APPLICATION:
Please complete online meeting application at the CPS website in order 
to attend the meeting. The deadline for the application is May 13, 2015, 
11:59 p.m. Japan Standard Time (GMT+09:00). Because the number of 
participants is limited to a maximum of 50, the online application does 
not guarantee admission to the meeting. Participants will be determined 
at the discretion of the SOC and all applicants will be notified of the 
admissions decision by May 31, 2015. Priority will be given to those who 
contribute to oral or poster sessions and retain enthusiasm for 
discussions throughout the meeting. For further details, please visit 
the Cosmic Dust website.
https://www.cps-jp.org/~dust/Application.html

REGISTRATION FEE:
The early bird rate of 10,000 JPY is available for those who complete 
both admissions application and abstract submission by April 30, 2015. 
The registration fee for those who complete admissions application on 
and after May 1, 2015 is 15,000 JPY. While no payment is required at the 
time of admissions application and abstract submission, the registration 
fee should be paid by cash on arrival at the venue. No matter what 
circumstances are specified, the registration fee will not be waived.

BRIEF HISTORY:
The Cosmic Dust meeting started in 2006 as a session called “Cosmic 
Dust” of the 3rd AOGS (Asia-Oceania Geoscience Society) annual meeting 
in Singapore. Dust freaks have kept on organizing the session at 
subsequent AOGS meetings in Korea (2008), India (2010), and Taiwan 
(2011). The Cosmic Dust series has been recognized as the most 
successful session of the AOGS Planetary Sciences Section. In 2012, the 
time was ripe to be free from organizing restrictions on the AOGS 
meeting. From that time on, the Cosmic Dust meeting is totally 
independent of any international conference. The past meetings on Cosmic 
Dust have been held in a relaxed and joyful atmosphere. So will be the 
coming one!￼

Friday - October 24, 2014, 2-3pm in R620

Speaker: Chao-Chin Yang (Lund Univ.)

Title: Stumbling Blocks of Planet Formation

Abstract: In contrast to almost two thousand extrasolar planet
candidates detected over the past couple of decades, the theoretical
consideration presents itself many difficulties in the course of
planet formation.  I will review several of these difficulties and
discuss some of their possible solutions.  Specifically, I will
present: (1) the problematic fast inward migration of earth-sized
planets in a gaseous protoplanetary disk; (2) the probability of
collisional destruction between kilometer-sized planetesimals within a
turbulent environment; and (3) how the frictional drag between gas and
solid materials could concentrate the latter fast enough to overcome
the constant angular momentum loss experienced by meter-sized objects.

Dear Taiwan Astronomy Network members,
(cc Piet Hut/SOC chair)

Greetings from the Earth-Life Science Institute in Tokyo.  May I ask you =
to post the announcement of our upcoming symposium through your =
newsletter and/or mailing list?  I have provided the text below.

Thank you in advance, and please let me know if you have any questions.=20=

------------------------------------------------

The Earth-Life Science Institute (ELSI) will be holding its 3rd =
International Symposium on January 13-15, 2015, in Tokyo, Japan.

The main theme of ELSI's 3rd International Symposium is the fundamental =
question: "Is there life in the Universe, outside Earth?"  We still =
don't know the answer, but there is a good chance that the answer will =
be found within our lifetime.  Robotic exploration within the solar =
system, as well as observations of planets circling other stars, may =
soon give us more tentative hints, and possibly even convincing =
evidence, of extraterrestrial forms of life.  During the 3-day =
symposium, we will address three questions, respectively: 1) which =
planets seem fit as potential cradles of life; 2) what can we say about =
the likely properties of more universal forms of life, different from =
the one specific example we know on Earth; and 3) how can we best try to =
find signs of life elsewhere.

Speaker:    Kuan-Yu Liu (ASIAA)
Topic:         Integrated Dual Polarization SIS Mixer at 350 GHz
Time:         10/20 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
To improve the efficiency and survey speed of a radio telescope, an integrated dual polarization (IDP) receiver for a large format multi-pixel array has been designed by integrating superconductor-insulator-superconductor (SIS) junction mixers with a planar orthomode transducer (OMT) at 350 GHz. The incoming signals from a circular waveguide are separated into two polarizations via orthogonal waveguide probes, and then transmitted to the junctions through the tuning circuit. To suppress resonance, metallic blocks confine the RF signals within the circular waveguide, and a 2μm thick silicon nitride membrane, on which all devices were implemented, was suspended across the circular waveguide. 
IDP mixers with junction quality factor (Rsg/Rn) of 10 have been fabricated by using standard Nb-based SIS junction technology and SiN/Si membrane process. The double-side-band (DSB) receiver noise temperature (Trx) of both polarizations, measured simultaneously in a 4K cryostat, is approximately 100K at between 332GHz and 372GHz. The isolation of cross polarization is approximately 20dB.



*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Larry Denneau (University of Hawaii)
Topic:         Observational constraints on the catastrophic disruption rate of main belt asteroids using data from the Pan-STARRS all-sky survey
Time:         10/22 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
The current rate of catastrophic disruptions in the Solar System can be used to constrain models of its formation and evolution. Employing a simple model for an observed catastrophic disruption of an asteroid, we present the results of a search for catastrophic disruptions in the Pan-STARRS all-sky survey. We find that the size of objects disrupting at a rate of once per year in the main belt due to impact is no larger than ~7 m diameter, much smaller (and therefore less frequent) than predicted by contemporary models such as Bottke et al. (2005), who predicted one impact-generated disruption per year at 100 m diameter.  We suggest that this discrepancy can be accounted for by rotational disruption of asteroids, found by Jacobson et al. (2014) to be much more frequent that impact-generated disruptions.  We estimate that in the near-future, Pan-STARRS and other all-sky surveys may detect as many as 10 disruption events per year.  We characterize the efficacy of the PS1 survey 
in detecting moving objects and other transients, and briefly summarize the capability of current and upcoming surveys to detect similar phenomena. We expand our discussion of future surveys to present an overview of the challenges for data processing of transient events in the era of Pan-STARRS, ATLAS, ZTF and LSST.
