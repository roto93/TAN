========= UST-GUAS Radio Astronomy Winter School 2015 =========

  Date: 10-13, February, 2015
  Venue: Daemyung resort, Jeju Island, Korea
  URL: http://kava.kasi.re.kr/contents/activities.php
  Application deadline: 20, December, 2014

===============================================================

Radio astronomy has been playing an essential role in deepening the human
understanding of the universe for recent 90 years, and in East Asian regions
there have been a plenty of on-going radio astronomy activities both in
observational astronomical research and technical development for future
radio astronomy projects.

UST-GUAS Radio Astronomy Winter School 2015, held on 10-13 February
2015 in Jeju Island in Korea, is planned to provide introductory courses of
radio astronomy to undergraduate and master-course students, especially
those who are interested in conducting future radio astronomy research in
Asian countries.

The main topics covered in the winter school are:

    a) Introduction to the radio astronomy world and
      the basics of radio observations

    b) Currently on-going and future radio astronomy projects,
      especially those related with Korea, Japan and
      East Asian Countries

    c) Science highlights in the modern radio astronomy


The winter school also includes tutorial/demo sessions for radio astronomy
data analysis as well as the visit to the KVN Tamna 21m radio telescope.

In order to support participations of young students, local expense in Jeju
(including costs for hotel room, meal, and tour to the KVN
telescope) will be provided by the sponsor institution (UST, Korea, and
GUAS/SOKENDAI, Japan). Support to the flight may be provided (only
partially), but the amount is dependent of the budgetary condition and it is
subject to change.

Due to the capacity limitation of the winter school venue, we expect that
the maximum number of acceptable students is around 50.
