Dear Prof Kuan,

Dear Colleagues

There will be a workshop on "Optical and Infrared Astronomy in Taiwan" 
to be held April 26 (Saturday) at ASIAA.  Past decadal plans, focused on 
radio astronomy, have been successful, and now the spectrum is shifted 
to optical and infrared wavelengths.  The purpose of the workshop, 
hopefully the first of a series, is to keep us all informed of the current 
status of the community, the difficulties and possible opportunities ahead 
of us, and, through sufficient discussions, to prioritize possible major 
projects or instruments that we should join forces to keep ourselves in 
the forefront of the field.  

The program is devised to consist of short talks to (1) update the progresses 
of ongoing major OIR projects, (2) introduce the human and financial 
situations now and in the prospected future, and (3) possible projects 
we can initiate or can join.  The emphasis is to brain storm to maximize 
our competitiveness, rather than being overwhelmed by presentations.  

So please join, so we hear your proposals, and you get to hear ours. The 
program attached below is tentative and by no means is exclusive.  If you 
want to contribute a talk, or suggest someone to do so, please just let 
Wei-Hao Wang (whwang@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw) or Wen-Ping Chen 
(wchen@astro.ncu.edu.tw) know.  Please also visit
