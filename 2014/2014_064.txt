*** Colloquium
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Tom Barclay (NASA ames)
Topic:        Exoplanet discoveries enabled by the precision photometry of Kepler
Time:        4/9 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
The Kepler spacecraft has reinvented the field of exoplanetary science. In this talk I will highlight what is possible with such high quality data. For large planets relativistic Doppler boosting can enable the determination of a planetâ€™s mass purely from photometry. Kepler also has revealed planets smaller than any in our own Solar System, I how how planets that block just 20 in every million photons coming from the star. Finally, I will discuss progress made toward finding the first Earth-like exoplanet.
