Topic:        Probing cosmic re-ionization with gamma ray burst 130606A at z~5.91
Time:        6/11 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
Understanding the cosmic re-ionization is one of the key goals of the
modern observational cosmology. The bright UV continuum of
high-redshift QSOs have been used as a background light source to
probe the cosmic re-ionization since it is absorbed by neutral
hydrogen. However, the original QSO continuum were difficult to be
fit, and thus have been the largest source of uncertainty.
We present the first gamma ray burst used for Gunn-Peterson
re-ionization test. With one of the quickest follow-up observation
using VLT/X-shooter, we obtained high S/N spectrum of a gamma ray
burst 130606A. Our measurements have much smaller uncertainty than
QSOs because of relatively flat, and simple synchrotron emission
continuum of GRB afterglows.

Topic:        Effects of Dynamical Evolution of Giant Planets on Survival of Terrestrial Planets
Time:        6/12 (Thursday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
The orbital distributions of currently observed extrasolar giant planets allow marginally stable orbits for hypothetical, terrestrial planets.  However, many of these giant planets have eccentric orbits that indicate dynamical instability in the past.  If this is the case, many such systems may not have additional planets on the "stable" orbits, since past dynamical evolution could have removed them. We numerically test this hypothesis by simulating the effects of early evolution of multiple giant planets on the orbital stability of the inner, sub-Neptune-like planets.  We find that secular perturbations from giant planets can remove test particles at least down to 10 times smaller than their minimum pericenter distance. Our results indicate that, unless the dynamical instability among giant planets is either absent or quiet like planet-planet collisions, most test particles down to ~0.1 AU within the orbits of giant planets at a few AU may be gone. We find a good agreement b
etween our numerical results and the secular theory as well as with the observations.

Topic:        Numerical simulations of hot accretion flows around black holes
Time:        6/12 (Thursday) 13:30 - 14:30
Place:        R1108
Abstract:
Numerical simulations of hot accretion flows are talked.  I mainly focus on the dynamics of the flows. For hydrodynamic simulations, I will talk about the convective instability in hot accretion flows and its impact on the flows. For magnetohydrodynamic simulations, I will talk about the magnetorotational instability  and the magnetically driven wind. For hot accretion flows with very low accretion rate (density), the mean free path of electrons can be as large as the scale of the whole flow,  magnetothermal instability in hot accretion flows is talked.
