*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Melody Wolk (University of Hawaii)
Topic:         Statistical properties of the matter density field
Time:         9/3 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
In our current paradigm of the Universe, gravitational instabilities give rise to the large scale structures observed today by hierarchical clustering. Two-point statistics are known to fail at providing a complete description as the actual galaxy distribution is non-Gaussian. Moreover, it has been shown that, beyond the linear regime, high order
moments no longer capture all the information encoded in the matter density field.
In this talk, I will introduce an optimal "sufficient statistics" in the case of discrete density fields such as the galaxy
distribution. This new observable was specially designed to capture all the useful cosmological information.
I will describe how it could be applied to one of the current "state of the art" photometric redshift surveys, the CFHTLS Wide, and discuss its efficiency compared to previous method focusing mainly on the power spectrum measurement.
I will also present some forecasts of this method for the upcoming large scale structure surveys.

*** Special Seminar ***
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Chihway Chang (ETH)
Topic:         Mapping the Universe â€” Weak Lensing Maps with the Dark Energy Survey and beyond
Time:         9/5 (Friday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
Our view of the Universe is distorted due to gravitational lensing. These distortions help us understand the content and history of the Universe. In this talk I will describe some of the early work that is being done with the DES Science Verification data to make the largest contiguous weak lensing maps of the sky to date. I then discuss a variety of exciting topics that can be explored with these maps as we look forward to several large optical surveys coming up in the next decade.
