The 3rd Circular
___________________


The 2014 Scientific Assembly of the Astronomical Society of the Republic of
China (ASROC2014) will be held at the Experimental Forest of National Taiwan
University on May 23 (Fri) - 25 (Sun), 2014. This is the annual event for all
astronomers and astrophysicists in Taiwan to demonstrate their most recent
discoveries and observations, to report their latest research results and to
exchange ideas, also to organize cooperation when desirable. ASROC2014 is also
an excellent venue for students, in particular graduate students, to present
their research findings or progress from their thesis studies.

    The meeting will include plenary talks, scientific and educational
sessions, poster presentation, and a business meeting. The featured plenary
speakers are 1) Prof. Debra Fischer of Yale University, Fellow of the American
Academy of Arts and Science. 2) Prof. Neal Evans II, the Edward Randall, Jr.
Centennial Professor in Astronomy of University of Texas at Austin. The titles
of plenary talks are "How will we find another Earth?" and "Progress in
understanding the formation of low mass stars," respectively. The scientific
program, including oral talks and poster presentations, is now available at the
meeting website: http://www.asroc.org.tw/asroc2014/en/program.php .

    In the Assembly, the Society will also present the 1st "Heaven Quest Award"
to Director Paul T.P. Ho of ASIAA for his distinguished contribution to
astronomical research, and the 1st "Heaven Talk Award" to Taipei Astronomical
Museum for its outstanding contribution to astronomy education and
popularization of astronomy. We will also conduct the election of councilors of
the 25th Council of the Society on May 25. In addition to the scientific agenda,
the afternoon of May 24 (Sat) is reserved for group discussions or group
excursions at choice; a conference banquet will be held later in the evening and
all meeting participants are welcome to attend. (Please see more details at
http://www.asroc.org.tw/asroc2014/en/venue.php )

    The online registration is now closed; those who missed the online
registration can still register on site. A registration fee of NT$1,000 (NT$800
for students) should be paid on site. 2014 annual membership fee will be waived
for ASROC members with registration fee paid.

Local Organizing Committee would like to remind all participants of the
following items:

*** Oral Presentations:
The oral program can be found at http://www.asroc.org.tw/asroc2014/en/program.php
the presentation time allocated to each talk includes the 3-minute Q&A time. All
speakers are strongly recommended to load your presentation files onto the
on-site computer before your session. The meeting will provide computers
equipped with Microsoft and Mac platforms and standard presentation software.
Please test your presentations in advance.

*** Poster Presentations:
The physical size of the poster board is about 80 cm wide and 180 cm high.
Posters should be set up before 5:00 pm on May 23. Authors can identify their
poster boards by the tagged ID number on top of each board. All posters should
be removed by authors before 1:30 pm on May 25.
    A competition for the Best Poster Award among student presentations will be
held during the meeting. Poster authors are recommended to attend their posters
during coffee breaks. The three awardees will be given the opportunity to
present a 3-minute oral report each on their award-winning research work in the
General Assembly to be held at 10:00 - 11:00 am on May 25 (Sun).

*** Accommodation Arrangement:
For those who have made lodging reservation via the LOC, you should have
received separated notices about the status of your reservation. If you have
sent in reservation request but did not get the notice, or if you want to make
adjustment, please contact the LOC by May 01 (Thu).

*** Tours:
For those who have signed up for the tours, you should have also received
notices about the status of the tour. Tour B1 is full, and people can sign up
for Tour B2 if you are interested. Please contact the LOC no later than May 01
(Thu).

*** Payment:
Payment includes the registration fee of NT$1,000 (NT$800 for students), the
banquet (NT$50/person), and the tour if you choose Tour B (NT$100/person).
Please prepare exact changes for your applicable payment at the time of
registration.

    Again, the ASROC sincerely welcome you to joining the 2014 Annual Meeting.

Abstract: http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/activity/colloquium.php

*** Colloquium
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Yosuke Mizuno (NTHU)
Topic:        Magnetic field amplification and saturation in turbulence behind a relativistic shock
Time:        4/30 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
Afterglows of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are believed to require magnetic
fields much stronger than that of the compressed preshock medium. As
an alternative to microscopic plasma instabilities, amplification of
the field by macroscopic turbulence has been proposed. We have
investigated via 2D relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations the
long-term evolution of turbulence created by a relativistic shock
propagating through an inhomogeneous medium. In the post-shock region,
magnetic field is strongly amplified by turbulent motions triggered by
pre-shock density inhomogeneities. The amplified magnetic field
evolved into a filamentary structure. The magnetic energy spectrum was
flatter than the Kolmogorov spectrum and indicated that the so-called
small-scale dynamo was occurring in the postshock region. Using a
long-simulation box we have followed the magnetic field amplification
until it is fully developed and saturated. The turbulent velocity is
sub-relativistic even for a strong shock. Magnetic field amplification
is controlled by the turbulent motion and saturation occurs when the
magnetic energy is comparable to the turbulent kinetic energy. We
found that magnetic field amplification and saturation depend on the
initial strength and direction of the magnetic field in the pre-shock
medium, and on the shock strength.
