Apologies for the multiple emails this week.  FYI, there will also be the
following special seminar next week on Thursday:

*** Special Seminar ***
____________________________________________________
Speaker:      Kiyo Masui (University of British Columbia)
Topic:          Large-scale structure with the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity
Mapping Experiment (CHIME)
Time:          10/30 (Thursday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:          R1203

The Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) proposes to map
the large-scale structure of the Universe in three dimensions by detecting
the redshifted 21 cm emission from neutral hydrogen. I will introduce the
CHIME instrument, its science goals, and some of the challenges it faces
going forward with a focus on data analysis.
