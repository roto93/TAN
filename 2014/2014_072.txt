Conference Title: 
New Era of Cosmology 
- Symposium on Inflationary Cosmology after BICEP2 

Date: May 4, 2014 
Place: 1st floor auditorium of ASIAA, Taipei 

Announcement 
The recent groundbreaking observation of primordial gravitational wave announced by BICEP2 collaboration not only gives strong experimental evidence for "cosmic inflation" as the paradigm for early universe, but also opens up a new window to probe fundamental physics at the highest energy scale. The aim of this one-day symposium is to bring together the experts from both theory and observations, through detailed presentations and the panel discussions, we hope to provide local community an overview of these striking developments, also possible exciting research directions in the near future.
