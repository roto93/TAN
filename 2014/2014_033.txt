Title: Testing Cosmology with Merging Galaxy Clusters

Abstract:
Clusters of galaxies, the most massive collapsed objects
known, form from the largest positive density fluctuations
of the early Universe. Merging clusters, the most energetic
events after the big bang, provide us laboratories to test
matter in extreme conditions, which can be used, for example,
to derive the self-scattering cross section of dark matter
particles, and test cosmological models via the dynamics of
merging. After reviewing the physics of merging clusters, we
focus on how the physical parameters of clusters and their
dynamics can be derived using multi-frequency observations
and self-consistent N-body-hydrodynamical simulations.
We present our results for the infall velocities of a few merging
clusters and discuss their significance for cosmology.
