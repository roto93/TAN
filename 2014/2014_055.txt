    Astronomical Society of the Republic of China 2014 Scientific Assembly
                                (ASROC2014)

          Experimental Forest of National Taiwan University, NanTou
                              May 23 - 25, 2014


The 2014 Scientific Assembly of the Astronomical Society of the Republic of China (ASROC2014) will be held at National Taiwan University Experimental Forest (NTUEF) on 2014 May 23 (Fri) - 25 (Sun). This is the annual event for all astronomers and astrophysicists in Taiwan to report their latest research results and to exchange new ideas. ASROC2014 is also an excellent venue for graduate students to present their research findings or progress from thesis studies.

    The meeting will include plenary talks, scientific and educational sessions, poster presentation, and a business meeting. The featured plenary speakers are 1) Prof. Debra Fischer of Yale University, Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Science. 2) Prof. Neal Evans, the Edward Randall, Jr. Centennial Professor in Astronomy of University of Texas at Austin. Prof. Fisher, a well-known astronomer and one of the pioneers in extrasolar planet search, will give a plenary talk on "How will we find another Earth?." Prof. Evans, a world leading expert in low-mass star formation, will talk about "Progress in understanding the formation of low mass stars."

    In the Assembly, the Society will also present the 1st Heaven Quest Award to Director Paul T.P. Ho of ASIAA for his distinguished contribution to astronomical research, and the 1st Heaven Talk Award to Taipei Astronomical Museum for its outstanding contribution to astronomy education and popularization of astronomy. In addition to the scientific agenda, the afternoon of May 24 (Sat) is reserved for group discussions or group excursions at choice; a conference banquet will be held later in the evening and all meeting participants are welcome to attend. Exhibitions of astronomical books and instruments are also planned during the meeting.

    ASROC2014 website is now open for registration and abstract submission. The deadline for online registration is April 15 and for abstract submission, March 31. Participants of the scientific assembly should submit their abstracts and register on-line. A registration fee of NT$1,000 (NT$800 for students) should be paid on site. The LOC will help to reserve 4-person suite in the student dormitory; participants who would like to use this service should inform the LOC (service@www.asroc.org.tw) before April 15; discount rate is offered for all rooms in the Education Center.

Abstract: http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/activity/colloquium.php

*** Colloquium
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Martin Bureau (Oxford)
Topic:        Molecular Gas in Early-type Galaxies. I. Kinematics
Time:        3/26 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
I will demonstrate that, contrary to expectations, early-types
galaxies contain a significant amount of cold molecular gas, and that
the spatially-resolved kinematics of this gas can be used to establish
its origin. More importantly, the molecular gas turns out to be an
excellent, arguably the best tracer of the circular velocity in
early-type galaxies, thus allowing accurate total/dynamical mass
measurements. I will exploit this principally in two ways. First, to
show that an accurate CO Tully-Fisher (luminosity-circular velocity)
relation can easily be derived for early-type galaxies. This opens the
way to probe the mass growth of galaxies of all types to significant
redshits, with a unique and simple method. Second, to show that CO can
be used to accurately measure the mass of the supermassive black holes
lurking at galaxy centres. This opens the way for literaly hundreds of
measurements across the Hubble sequence, potentially revolutionising
our understanding of the co-evolution of galaxies and black holes.
