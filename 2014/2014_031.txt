Title : Cosmological constraints on Unstable Dark Matter and their Implications for Galactic Substructure Properties

  Abstract:
     The nature of dark matter remains unknown. Observation on large-scale generally agrees well with the cold dark matter scenarios. However, for the past decade several issues on galactic substructure properties have been discussed, and one of the possible solutions is to change the properties of dark matter. A few popular models, including warm dark matter (WDM) and self-interacting dark matter (SIDM), have been examined in details recently. As we try to settle the controversies on small scale, the best approach is to look for complementary astrophysical constraints to isolate the viable parameter space. In our study we considered a class of unstable dark matter model in which a dark matter particle decays into a slightly less massive stable dark matter particle and a massless particle. I especially focus on late decay scenario with decay lifetime around the order of the age of the Universe.  I will show that by using contemporary SDSS Lyman-alpha forest measurement combi!
 ning with WMAP data we can place interesting and competitive limits on decaying dark matter (DDM) models. Because of its late-decay nature, this class of DDM models can have significant effects on galactic substructure at present time while agree with observations on high-redshift intergalactic medium (IGM) distribution. I will discuss the features of DDM models on various aspects of galactic-scale problems comparing to other dark matter models.  At the end I will discuss several possible ways to improve model constraints, for example by using newly-released BOSS Lyman-alpha forest data and also late-time phenomena like forthcoming weak lensing measurement. Also I will briefly discuss how we may distinguish between CDM and alternative DM models using high-quality Milky Way dwarf spheroidal (dSph) photometric and kinematic data.


Thanks,
Lance
