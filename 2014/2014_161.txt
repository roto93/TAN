                            tuCASA - ASIAA
              ALMA Community Day and CASA Workshop 2014


The UCAT Center for ALMA Science Advancement (tuCASA) and the Academia Sinica
Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA) are pleased to announce that
an ALMA Community Day together with a two-day CASA workshop will be held at the
Science Campus of National Taiwan Normal University on November 15 and 22, 2014.


CASA Workshop
_____________

The main purpose of the CASA Workshop, which is organized by tuCASA and
cosponsored by ALMA Regional Center of Taiwan (ARC-Taiwan) of ASIAA, is to help
potential ALMA users to familiarize themselves with CASA (Common Astronomy
Software Applications) package for the post-processing of the ALMA data.
Faculty, research staff and graduate students of UCAT (University Consortium of
ALMA-Taiwan) who are interested in using ALMA data for their research but have
little knowledge of CASA package are particularly welcome.

    The workshop format will be short lectures interlaced with hands-on
exercises basically. The detailed program can be found at
    http://140.122.162.144/tuCASA/CASA2014_wksp/program/ 

    Participants are required to bring along with you a notebook computer
running on either Mac OS or Linux, and please have the CASA program "CASA 4.2.2"
and "CASA User Reference & Cookbook 4.2.2" downloaded in advance at
    http://casa.nrao.edu/casa_obtaining.shtml 

    Please also have the dataset "CASA2014_data.zip" readily downloaded prior to
the workshop from
    http://140.122.162.144/tuCASA/CASA2014_wksp/ALMA_data/CASA2014_data.zip 


ALMA Community Day
__________________

The major goal of the ALMA Community Day, organized by ARC-T of ASIAA and
cosponsored by tuCASA, is to make better ALMA science and better ALMA proposals.
The ALMA Community Day will focus on:  1) to update Taiwan community the status
of ALMA and other radio facilities, including JCMT, CSO and SMA, that
astronomers in Taiwan have access to;  2) to improve ALMA proposals from Taiwan;
3) to attract more non-radio astronomers to use the ALMA.

    In addition, we will learn how to search for and identify ALMA archival
data, including ALMA Science Verification (SV) data and Cycle-0 & Cycle-1 data,
that we may be interested in working on. We will also discuss all practical
concerns for ALMA archival data retrieval. Participants who know their target
sources beforehand or have clear science goals in mind are encouraged to
contact Dr. Kuo-Song Wang directly before November 7 so Dr. Wang
(kswang@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw) may help you to locate appropriate datasets more
effectively. If you do want to download ALMA archival datasets to work on for
actual research, a 1-on-1 tutorial on data retrieval is available on November
15, please register first.

    Proposal MOCK Review is also available on November 22 for a 1-on-1
discussion on your unsuccessful proposals in previous cycles. Please register
first and send your proposals to almamock@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw by November 15.
