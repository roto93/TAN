*** Colloquium
____________________________________________________
Speaker:        Phil Marshall (KIPAC, Stanford University)
Topic:          Space Warps: crowd-sourcing the discovery of gravitational lenses
Time:           3/12 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Gravitational lenses are very useful astrophysical tools, providing direct
mass measurements of galaxies and clusters, a magnified view of the distant
universe, and experimental probes of both dark matter and dark energy. Key to
extending the science made possible by gravitational lenses is the discovery
of more systems in wide field imaging surveys, but their complex nature makes
finding lenses a difficult process to automate. Space Warps is a citizen
science project that enables new lenses to be detected by volunteers
inspecting images displayed to them via a custom-built website. Over 10,000
volunteers took part in the first Space Warps project, a blind search of the
CFHT Legacy Survey imaging. I will present premliminary results from this project,
including the first new lens systems to be detected and analyzed by citizen
scientists. The second Space Warps project, a smaller targeted search in the VICS82 survey launched in January of this year and was completed in 3 days, thanks to the efforts of nearly 60,000 volunteers inspired by the BBC Stargazing Live TV programmes. I will share results and conclusions from that project too, and speculate on how this approach in general might be extended into the LSST era.
