Topic:        Magnetic field amplification and saturation in turbulence behind a relativistic shock
Time:        4/30 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
Afterglows of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are believed to require magnetic
fields much stronger than that of the compressed preshock medium. As
an alternative to microscopic plasma instabilities, amplification of
the field by macroscopic turbulence has been proposed. We have
investigated via 2D relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations the
long-term evolution of turbulence created by a relativistic shock
propagating through an inhomogeneous medium. In the post-shock region,
magnetic field is strongly amplified by turbulent motions triggered by
pre-shock density inhomogeneities. The amplified magnetic field
evolved into a filamentary structure. The magnetic energy spectrum was
flatter than the Kolmogorov spectrum and indicated that the so-called
small-scale dynamo was occurring in the postshock region. Using a
long-simulation box we have followed the magnetic field amplification
until it is fully developed and saturated. The turbulent velocity is
sub-relativistic even for a strong shock. Magnetic field amplification
is controlled by the turbulent motion and saturation occurs when the
magnetic energy is comparable to the turbulent kinetic energy. We
found that magnetic field amplification and saturation depend on the
initial strength and direction of the magnetic field in the pre-shock
medium, and on the shock strength.
