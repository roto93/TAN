>> Dear colleagues,
>> 
>> Now we are planning to have the following face-to-face meeting
>> at ASIAA in December, just after the PFS collaboration meeting.
>> This is not only for AGN researchers but also for researchers in
>> closely related fields including galaxy evolution, large-scale structure,
>> IGM physics, and so on. Please take a look at this circular.
>> 
>> Thanks,
>> Tohru Nagao

>> First Circular:
>> Evolution of SMBHs with HSC: First results from initial dataset
>> 
>> ==============================
>> 18th - 20th December 2014
>> Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Academia Sinica (ASIAA),
>> Taipei, Taiwan
>> http://phys.koshigaya.bunkyo.ac.jp/HSC-SMBH2014/
>> ==============================
>> 
>> 
>> The formation and evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are
>> among the most exciting and challenging topics in astronomy and
>> astrophysics. New wide-field deep surveys are required to tackle
>> these issues, and Subaru's new wide-field camera (Hyper Suprime-Cam;
>> HSC) will bring promising opportunities to make breakthroughs in
>> this research field. The HSC-SSP (Subaru Strategic Program) survey
>> obtained its first data in March 2014, and is now delivering
>> outstanding data. In this workshop, we will have intensive
>> face-to-face discussion among HSC collaboration astronomers (from
>> Taiwan, Japan, and Princeton) about scientific opportunities from
>> the first-year data. Note that this workshop is a closed meeting,
>> only for the HSC collaborators from Taiwan, Japan, and Princeton.
>> 
>> We will focus on doing science and writing papers based on the
>> first-year data of the HSC-SSP survey. Specifically we will focus
>> on the following topics:
>>  -- Current status of the HSC hardware
>>  -- HSC reduction pipeline, database, and the internal data release
>>  -- Outcomes of the S14A and S14B runs
>>  -- Quasar selection methods
>>  -- AGN photometric redshifts
>>  -- Statistics of quasars and SMBHs from the HSC data
>>  -- Co-evolution studies of SMBHs and galaxies with the HSC data
>>  -- Synergies of HSC and multi-wavelength data for SMBH studies
>>  -- Strategies for spectroscopic follow-up and the relation with PFS
>>  -- Theoretical preparations for HSC quasar surveys
>>  -- Discussion for publications and the S15A runs
>>  -- Action items for the HSC-SSP 2nd year and beyond that
>> 
>> The meeting will take place at Academia Sinica, Institute of Astronomy
>> and Astrophysics (ASIAA). The institute is located in the city of
>> Taipei, the capital of Taiwan, on the grounds of National Taiwan
>> University (*not* in the Academia Sinica Campus near Nan-Kang). The
>> weather in Taipei is typically fine and warm in December, and visitors
>> can enjoy nearby night markets (the nearest one is within walking
>> distance), historical places within the city, excellent museums, one
>> of the tallest skyscrapers in the world, and superb cuisine, all
>> accessible with a very convenient subway system.
>> 
>> Details of registration, abstract submission, travel info, and so on
>> will be announced in the second circular, which will be distributed
>> in the late September. Though the total available budget is limited,
>> we will be able to support travel expenses for some of the
>> participants. More details on this travel support will be announced
>> in the second circular. If you have any questions, please feel free
>> to contact us (see below).
>> 
>> We plan to arrange your hotel reservations after gathering
>> information about your stay, which will be announced in the 2nd
>> circular. We can also help with visas, and therefore please let the
>> LOC know as soon as possible if you need the travel visa.
>> 
>> We are looking forward to seeing you in Taipei!
