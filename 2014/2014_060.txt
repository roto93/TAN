    Astronomical Society of the Republic of China 2014 Scientific Assembly
                                (ASROC2014)

          Experimental Forest of National Taiwan University, NanTou
                              May 23 - 25, 2014


The 2014 Scientific Assembly of the Astronomical Society of the Republic of China (ASROC2014) will be held at National Taiwan University Experimental Forest (NTUEF) on 2014 May 23 (Fri) - 25 (Sun). This is the annual event for all astronomers and astrophysicists in Taiwan to report their latest research results and to exchange new ideas. ASROC2014 is also an excellent venue for graduate students to present their research findings or progress from thesis studies.

    The meeting will include plenary talks, scientific and educational sessions, poster presentation, and a business meeting. The featured plenary speakers are 1) Prof. Debra Fischer of Yale University, Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Science. 2) Prof. Neal Evans, the Edward Randall, Jr. Centennial Professor in Astronomy of University of Texas at Austin. Prof. Fisher, a well-known astronomer and one of the pioneers in extrasolar planet search, will give a plenary talk on "How will we find another Earth?." Prof. Evans, a world leading expert in low-mass star formation, will talk about "Progress in understanding the formation of low mass stars."

    In the Assembly, the Society will also present the 1st Heaven Quest Award to Director Paul T.P. Ho of ASIAA for his distinguished contribution to astronomical research, and the 1st Heaven Talk Award to Taipei Astronomical Museum for its outstanding contribution to astronomy education and popularization of astronomy. In addition to the scientific agenda, the afternoon of May 24 (Sat) is reserved for group discussions or group excursions at choice; a conference banquet will be held later in the evening and all meeting participants are welcome to attend. Exhibitions of astronomical books and instruments are also planned during the meeting.

    ASROC2014 website is now open for registration and abstract submission. The deadline for online registration is April 15 and for abstract submission, March 31. Participants of the scientific assembly should submit their abstracts and register on-line. A registration fee of NT$1,000 (NT$800 for students) should be paid on site. The LOC will help to reserve 4-person suite in the student dormitory; participants who would like to use this service should inform the LOC (service@www.asroc.org.tw) before April 15; discount rate is offered for all rooms in the Education Center.

Dear Prof Kuan,

Below is a workshop announcement. Please help to forward it to TAN.

Cheers,
Wei-Hao


Dear Colleagues

There will be a workshop on "Optical and Infrared Astronomy in Taiwan" 
to be held April 26 (Saturday) at ASIAA.  Past decadal plans, focused on 
radio astronomy, have been successful, and now the spectrum is shifted 
to optical and infrared wavelengths.  The purpose of the workshop, 
hopefully the first of a series, is to keep us all informed of the current 
status of the community, the difficulties and possible opportunities ahead 
of us, and, through sufficient discussions, to prioritize possible major 
projects or instruments that we should join forces to keep ourselves in 
the forefront of the field.  

The program is devised to consist of short talks to (1) update the progresses 
of ongoing major OIR projects, (2) introduce the human and financial 
situations now and in the prospected future, and (3) possible projects 
we can initiate or can join.  The emphasis is to brain storm to maximize 
our competitiveness, rather than being overwhelmed by presentations.  

So please join, so we hear your proposals, and you get to hear ours. The 
program attached below is tentative and by no means is exclusive.  If you 
want to contribute a talk, or suggest someone to do so, please just let 
Wei-Hao Wang (whwang@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw) or Wen-Ping Chen 
(wchen@astro.ncu.edu.tw) know.  Please also visit

    Title:  Multi-wavelength Studies on
            Be/X-ray Binaries

    Abstract:
Be/X-ray Binaries are a major subclass of high mass X-ray binaries.
The compact object moves in a moderately eccentric orbit around the
Be star in the system. There are two different discs in the Be/X-ray
binary, a circumstellar disk around the Be star and an accretion disk
around the compact object. In this talk, I will present our optical
spectroscopic and photometric observational results on several Be/X-ray
binaries, such as A 0535+26, MXB 0656-072, X Per, and LS V+44 17.  An
anti-correlation between the optical brightness and the strength of the
H emission was observed: when the optical brightness showed a decrease,
the intensity of the H emission displayed an obvious increase. This
anti-correlation is interpreted as the result of the mass ejection from
the Be star. The X-ray outbursts of the Be/X-ray binaries might be
connected with the mass ejections from the Be star.

        Tea/Discussion Time is followed !
                  All Welcome !!

> Subject: ASIAA/CCMS/IAMS/LeCosPA/NTU-Physics Joint Colloquium, April 1

Dear Colleagues,

You are cordially invited to attend the Joint Colloquium which will be held on April 1 (http://web.phys.ntu.edu.tw/colloquium/).

The Joint Colloquium Series is organized by the NTU Physics Department, Center for Condensed Matter Science (CCMS), Leung Center for Cosmology and Particle Astrophysics (LeCosPA), Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA), and the Institute of Atomic and Molecular Sciences (IAMS).

The idea is to have excellent speakers to give inspiring, informative, but non-technical talks on the frontiers of Sciences.

Enclosed below is the information of the Joint Colloquium on  April 1.

Best regards,

Yen-Ting Lin (ASIAA)
Michitoshi Hayashi (CCMS)
Chia-Lung Hsieh (IAMS)
Jiwoo Nam (LeCosPA)

ASIAA/CCMS/IAMS/LeCosPA/NTU-Physics Joint Colloquium

Speaker: Chao-Lin Kuo
        (Stanford University)

Topic :  BICEP2 Results, Implications, and Future

Time  : 04/01 (Tue.) 14:20 - 15:20

Place : Room 204, CCMS-New Physics Building

Abstract:
    The BICEP2 team has just announced the detection of degree-scale B-mode polarization of the CMB, consistent with the imprint of inflationary gravitational waves. r=0 model is ruled out at very high significance. BICEP2 is the second generation in the BICEP/Keck series of small refractor experiments. I will discuss the immediate prospect of confirming and expanding BICEP2's discovery by Keck Array and BICEP3. A dedicated program that covers more sky can significantly reduce the uncertainties on tensor amplitude, putting models of inflation to further test.

Brief Bio:
    Prof. Chao-Lin Kuo received his Bachelor degree from NTU Physics Department in 1994 and Ph.D. in Astrophysics from U.C. Berkeley in 2003. After a postdoctoral fellowship at Caltech/JPL, he is currently Assistant Professor of Physics at Stanford University and SLAC. Prof. Kuo studies the polarization of the most ancient light, the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation, emitted when the universe was in its infancy. The polarization in the CMB contains information on the birth of the universe (big bang/inflation), as well as its subsequent evolution. 
    Prof. Kuo is involved in both cosmological interpretation and instrumentation/technology development, focusing on experiments including BICEP/BICEP2/Keck Array/POLAR Array. He is an expert in advanced experimental techniques, such as cryogenics, superconductivity, and micromachining, for maximizing detector sensitivity to the faint CMB signal. Prof. Kuo has been awarded an Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellowship in 2009, an MRI (Major Research Instrumentation) grant in 2010, and an NSF Faculty Early CAREER Award in 2011.
