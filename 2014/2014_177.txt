                            tuCASA - ASIAA
              ALMA Community Day and CASA Workshop 2014


The UCAT Center for ALMA Science Advancement (tuCASA) and the Academia Sinica
Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA) are pleased to announce that
an ALMA Community Day together with a two-day CASA workshop will be held at the
Science Campus of National Taiwan Normal University on November 15 and 22, 2014.


CASA Workshop
_____________

The main purpose of the CASA Workshop, which is organized by tuCASA and
cosponsored by ALMA Regional Center of Taiwan (ARC-Taiwan) of ASIAA, is to help
potential ALMA users to familiarize themselves with CASA (Common Astronomy
Software Applications) package for the post-processing of the ALMA data.
Faculty, research staff and graduate students of UCAT (University Consortium of
ALMA-Taiwan) who are interested in using ALMA data for their research but have
little knowledge of CASA package are particularly welcome.

    The workshop format will be short lectures interlaced with hands-on
exercises basically. The detailed program can be found at
    http://140.122.162.144/tuCASA/CASA2014_wksp/program/ 

    Participants are required to bring along with you a notebook computer
running on either Mac OS or Linux, and please have the CASA program "CASA 4.2.2"
and "CASA User Reference & Cookbook 4.2.2" downloaded in advance at
    http://casa.nrao.edu/casa_obtaining.shtml 

    Please also have the dataset "CASA2014_data.zip" readily downloaded prior to
the workshop from
    http://140.122.162.144/tuCASA/CASA2014_wksp/ALMA_data/CASA2014_data.zip 


ALMA Community Day
__________________

The major goal of the ALMA Community Day, organized by ARC-T of ASIAA and
cosponsored by tuCASA, is to make better ALMA science and better ALMA proposals.
The ALMA Community Day will focus on:  1) to update Taiwan community the status
of ALMA and other radio facilities, including JCMT, CSO and SMA, that
astronomers in Taiwan have access to;  2) to improve ALMA proposals from Taiwan;
3) to attract more non-radio astronomers to use the ALMA.

    In addition, we will learn how to search for and identify ALMA archival
data, including ALMA Science Verification (SV) data and Cycle-0 & Cycle-1 data,
that we may be interested in working on. We will also discuss all practical
concerns for ALMA archival data retrieval. Participants who know their target
sources beforehand or have clear science goals in mind are encouraged to
contact Dr. Kuo-Song Wang directly before November 7 so Dr. Wang
(kswang@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw) may help you to locate appropriate datasets more
effectively. If you do want to download ALMA archival datasets to work on for
actual research, a 1-on-1 tutorial on data retrieval is available on November
15, please register first.

    Proposal MOCK Review is also available on November 22 for a 1-on-1
discussion on your unsuccessful proposals in previous cycles. Please register
first and send your proposals to almamock@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw by November 15.


Dates and Venue
_______________

November 15 and November 22 (Saturdays) at Rm S101 of the Research Building
(±Ð¾Ç¬ã¨s¤j¼Ó) on the Science Campus of National Taiwan Normal University (®v¤j¤À³¡).

Speaker:    Ti-Lin Chou (ASIAA)
Topic:         Transition from the Infalling Envelope to the Keplerian Disk around L1551 IRS 5
Time:         11/10 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
We present combined SMA+ASTE images of the Class I protobinary L1551 IRS 5 in the CS (J = 7--6) line, the submillimeter images of L1551 IRS 5 with the most complete spatial sampling ever achieved (0â€³.9 -- 36â€³). The SMA image of L1551 IRS 5 in the 343 GHz dust-continuum emission is also presented, which shows an elongated feature along the northwest to southeast direction (âˆ¼160 AU Ã— 80 AU), perpendicular to the associated radio jets. The combined SMA+ASTE images show that the high-velocity (â‰³1.5 km sâˆ’1) CS emission traces the structure of the dust component and shows a velocity gradient along the major axis, which is reproduced by a geometrically-thin Keplerian-disk model with a central stellar mass of âˆ¼0.5 MâŠ™. The low-velocity (â‰²1.3 km sâˆ’1) CS emission shows an extended (âˆ¼1000 AU) feature that exhibits slight south (blueshifted) to north (redshifted) emission offsets, which is modeled with a rotating and infalling envelope with a conserved angular momentu
m. The rotational motion of the envelope connects smoothly to the inner Keplerian rotation at a radius of âˆ¼64 AU. The infalling velocity of the envelope is âˆ¼three times lower than the free-fall velocity toward the central stellar mass of 0.5 MâŠ™. These results demonstrate transition from the infalling envelope to the Keplerian disk, consistent with the latest theoretical studies of disk formation. We suggest that sizable (râˆ¼50--200 AU) Keplerian disks are already formed when the protostars are still deeply embedded in the envelopes.


*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Claudio Grillo (University of Copenhagen)
Topic:         The dark-matter haloes of massive galaxies and clusters of galaxies
Time:         11/11 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
The physics of gravitational light deflection, or gravitational lensing, offers a great variety of applications in several fields of astrophysics. In particular, in the strong lensing regime, observations of multiple images of background sources created by intervening mass concentrations provide a unique opportunity of measuring very precisely the total mass of these intervening lenses. The combination of strong gravitational lensing and stellar population models has turned out to be an invaluable tool to disentangle the luminous and dark-matter components in the inner regions of distant galaxies and clusters of galaxies. I will show how, by using these techniques on unprecedented data obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope and the Very Large Telescope, we have been able to investigate the properties of the dark-matter haloes and subhaloes of massive lens early-type galaxies and galaxy clusters in the CASSOWARY and CLASH surveys.

> Subject: Inspire and "The Universe"

November 7, 2014

Inspire is the High Energy Physcis information system run jointly by 
the four biggest laboratories, SLAC, Fermilab, CERN, and DESY. The 
information disseminated by Inspire is supposed to be important in the 
high energy physics community at large.

"The Universe" is the journal/newsletter of Asia Pacific Organization for 
Cosmomoly and Particle Astrophysics (APCosPA Org), launched last year 
(2013).

About a month ago, Inspire started to provide a "live" coverage of 
"Universe"; so far all the articles under "Universe" are exhibited - it is 
"live" because the current citation histories of articles are provided on 
the screen.
