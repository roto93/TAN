The 2014 Scientific Assembly of the Astronomical Society of the Republic of
China (ASROC2014) will be held at the Experimental Forest of National Taiwan
University on May 23 (Fri) - 25 (Sun), 2014. This is the annual event for all
astronomers and astrophysicists in Taiwan to demonstrate their most recent
discoveries and observations, to report their latest research results and to
exchange ideas, also to organize cooperation when desirable. ASROC2014 is also
an excellent venue for students, in particular graduate students, to present
their research findings or progress from their thesis studies.

    The meeting will include plenary talks, scientific and educational
sessions, poster presentation, and a business meeting. The featured plenary
speakers are 1) Prof. Debra Fischer of Yale University, Fellow of the American
Academy of Arts and Science. 2) Prof. Neal Evans II, the Edward Randall, Jr.
Centennial Professor in Astronomy of University of Texas at Austin. The titles
of plenary talks are "How will we find another Earth?" and "Progress in
understanding the formation of low mass stars," respectively. The scientific
program, including oral talks and poster presentations, is now available at the
meeting website: http://www.asroc.org.tw/asroc2014/en/program.php .

    In the Assembly, the Society will also present the 1st "Heaven Quest Award"
to Director Paul T.P. Ho of ASIAA for his distinguished contribution to
astronomical research, and the 1st "Heaven Talk Award" to Taipei Astronomical
Museum for its outstanding contribution to astronomy education and
popularization of astronomy. We will also conduct the election of councilors of
the 25th Council of the Society on May 25. In addition to the scientific agenda,
the afternoon of May 24 (Sat) is reserved for group discussions or group
excursions at choice; a conference banquet will be held later in the evening and
