Title: CHIRPS: Coevality with Herschel: infrared and radio protostellar SEDs

Abstract: Multiple protstellar systems are commonplace in early star
formation. It is widely agreed that fragmentation is the main
formation mechanism, however when fragmentation occurs is still a
major question. The relative evolutionary stages, i.e. coevality, is
the main tell-tale sign of when fragmentation occurred. In order to
study the coevality of multiple protostellar systems, the evolutionary
stage of each component in a system needs to be determined. The first
step towards evolutionary stage determination is the construction of
the protostar's Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) together with the
derivation of physical parameters (e.g. bolometric luminosity and
temperature) from the SED. However, SEDs are affected by geometry,
thus the protostar's environment needs to be taken into account. In
turn, the environment can help further constrain the evolutionary
stage of a protostar. In this talk, the CHIRPS project will be
introduced, focusing on the sample selection, SED construction method,
and the challenges ahead, illustrated by some initial results of this
on-going project.
