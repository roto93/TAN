Speaker:    Bernd Liebig (ASIAA)
Topic:         NanoSIMS 2014 â€“ Challenges and Chances
Time:         12/8 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
Close to the end of the year 2014, I will give a summary about the projects we have carried out using our NanoSIMS (Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometer) over the past twelve months. This will cover various fields, such as cosmochemistry and geochemistry, as well as microbiology and material sciences. I will demonstrate the versatility of this instrument, look back on the challenges of the last year and give an outlook on the future of our lab.



*** ASIAA/NTU Joint Colloquium ***

Speaker:    David Jewitt (UCLA)
Topic:         Comet Science
Time:         12/9 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         physics 104
Abstract:
Most comets are ice-containing bodies that have been stored in one of two distant reservoirs (the Kuiper belt and the Oort cloud) since the formation of the Solar system. I will provide an accessible, sweeping and scientifically up-to-date overview of the current understanding of comets, of their storage reservoirs, and of their importance for understanding the formation and evolution of the Solar system.



*** Colloquium ***

Speaker:    David Jewitt (UCLA)
Topic:         Sunlight Torques and Amorphous Ice
Time:         12/10 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
This talk will consist of two parts.  First, I will discuss the latest findings concerning the Active Asteroids, nearby objects which continue to amaze with their unexpectedly varied properties.  I will present evidence that some Active Asteroids are being rotationally disrupted by torques imposed by sunlight.  Second, I will discuss the central importance of, evidence for, and puzzles concerning, amorphous ice in the Solar system.
