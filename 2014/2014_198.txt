Title: Pan-STARRS 1 Andromeda survey (PAndromea)

Abstract:
    The 3-year, high-cadence PS1 Andromeda survey yields well-sampled
light curves that improve our understanding of microlensing and
variables in M31. As a preliminary study, we discover 6 microlensing
events in the inner bulge of M31. This demonstrates that deep data
with good temporal resolution are essential to reveal microlensing
events. We also explore the data for variability studies, and produce
catalogs of ~300 eclipsing binaries, ~2000 Cepheids and other
variables. We select bright eclipsing binaries for spectroscopic
follow-up, to obtain a direct distance estimate of M31. We
astromatrically align the multi-band Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda
Treasury (PHAT) data to our PS1 images, and derive precise
period-luminosity relation (PLR) for the Cepheids. The accurate
distance and precise PLR will render M31 a distance anchor and help to
reduce the error budget of Hubble constant. To fully exploit the value
of PAndromeda, we welcome external collaborators, and can provide PS1
light curves with linked HST photometry upon request.
