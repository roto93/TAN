Topic:         LNA and mixer design for ALMA band-1 warm cartridge
Time:         9/22 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
ALMA band-1 is the lowest frequency band among ALMA receivers. The microwave monolithic integrated circuit (MMIC) is an attractive technique for circuit design due to its compact size, high performance, and easy to mass production. In this talk, a low noise amplifier (LNA) and a mixer are designed using MMIC technique for ALMA band-1 warm cartridge.

Topic:         Dwarf Galaxies and Their Role as Building Blocks
Time:         9/24 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
Dwarf galaxies are the most common type of galaxy in the Universe and include the most dark-matter-dominated objects known.  They offer intriguing insights into evolutionary processes at low halo masses
and low metallicities.  Moreover, as survivors of a once much more numerous population of building blocks of larger galaxies, they are key to understanding very early star formation processes.  The Local Group and particularly the Milky Way's dwarf galaxy entourage offer us the unique possibility to compare in detail dwarf and Galactic populations. This is an important step towards quantifying the magnitude and time scales of dwarf contributions to the build-up of the Milky Way and allows us to test predictions of cosmological theories and hierarchical structure formation.
