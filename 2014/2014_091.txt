afternoon of July 14th, 2014. Since most of Cycle 0 data were already =
archived, it is good time to think about ALMA archive sciences. Please =
join this session, hear science cases using archive data and learn how =
to navigate and collect observational data from a ALMA archive. Except =
of the archive session, most of time of July 14th will be devoted to a =
CASA (Common Astronomy Software Applications) tutorial. If you want to =
learn the CASA, please also join this tutorial session, too.
