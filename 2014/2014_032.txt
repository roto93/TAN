Dear Colleagues,

You are cordially invited to attend the Joint Colloquium which will be held
on March 4 (http://web.phys.ntu.edu.tw/colloquium/).

The Joint Colloquium Series is organized by the NTU Physics Department,
Center for Condensed Matter Science (CCMS), Leung Center for Cosmology and
Particle Astrophysics (LeCosPA), Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and
Astrophysics (ASIAA), and the Institute of Atomic and Molecular Sciences
(IAMS).

The idea is to have excellent speakers to give inspiring, informative, but
non-technical talks on the frontiers of Sciences.

Enclosed below is the information of the Joint Colloquium on March 4.

Best regards,

Yen-Ting Lin (ASIAA)
Michitoshi Hayashi (CCMS)
Chia-Lung Hsieh (IAMS)
Jiwoo Nam (LeCosPA)
Yuan-Huei Chang (NTU-Phys)

ASIAA/CCMS/IAMS/LeCosPA/NTU-Physics Joint Colloquium

Speaker: Yee Bob Hsiung

               (National Taiwan University)

Topic :  *The Elusive Neutrinos - neutrino oscillation, **mixing and mass
hierarchy*

Time  : 03/04 (Tue.) 14:20 - 15:20

Place : Room 104, CCMS-New Physics Building

Abstract:
    The tiny, nearly massless neutrinos have been one of the most elusive
particles in elementary particle physics in the past several decades. In
this talk I will review the experimental phenomena on the neutrino
oscillation, mixing and mass hierarchy, as well as the recent new results
from Daya Bay reactor neutrino experiment with spectral measurement.
    The discovery of non-zero q13 in 2012 and the unexpected large sin22q13 has
encouraged studies of the potential to resolve mass hierarchy such as the
proposed JUNO experiment. In this talk, I will describe the Daya Bay
experimental design, installation, calibration and data analysis. Together
with updates on the current results and status of Daya Bay, I will also
give a brief introduction to some potential future developments relevant to
the Daya Bay experiment.

Brief Bio:
    Prof. Yee Bob Hsiung received his Bachelor degree at NTU Physics
Department and Ph.D. in Physics at Columbia University.  He has been
working on experiments of discovering direct CP violation in neutral kaon
decays and rare K and B-meson decays, as well as LHC-CMS experiment to
search for new physics for many years, and in recent years on Daya Bay
neutrino oscillation experiment discovering 3rd mixing angle.  He was the
co-spokesperson of KTeV experiment at Fermilab before he returned to NTU in
2002. He received the Outstanding Scholar Awards from the Foundation for
the Advancement of Outstanding Scholarship (2003-2008), and was the physics
department chair (2007-2013) and the President of PSROC (2012-2014).
Recently he has received the 17th National Professorship of ROC in Taiwan
from Ministry of Education (2014-2017).
