Dear All,

  The NAOJ Chile Observatory invites proposals for observations at the ASTE for 2014b term. This is a good opportunity for East Asian astronomers to observe from the southern hemisphere with ASTE that is located near the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. In this period, single-beam spectroscopy observations in 350GHz band will be offered under the shared risk basis. 

  This opportunity is open to astronomers affiliated with institutes in Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea.

  Please see the following email from NAOJ.
