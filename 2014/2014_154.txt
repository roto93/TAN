MEETING TITLE:
Cosmic Dust

WEBSITE:

VENUE:
Tokyo Skytree Town Campus of Chiba Institute of Technology
8F solamachi, Tokyo Skytree Town(R)
1-1-2 Oshiage, Sumida-ku, Tokyo 131-0045, JAPAN
http://www.it-chiba.ac.jp/skytree/index_en.html

DATE:
Monday, August 17 – Friday, August 21, 2015

OBJECTIVES:
This series of Cosmic Dust meetings aims at finding a consensus among 
experts on the formation and evolution of cosmic dust: where it comes 
from and where it goes. The meeting is organized by dust freaks who are 
very enthusiastic not only to make the goal achievable but also to 
establish a dust community across every scientifically relevant 
discipline for the development of cosmic dust research. For this reason, 
the primary objective of the meeting is to bring together professionals 
who deal with cosmic dust as well as provide an opportunity for 
participants to develop human relations and interactions among themselves.

SCOPE:
All kinds of cosmic dust such as
• intergalactic dust
• circumnuclear dust
• interstellar dust
• protoplanetary disk dust
• debris disk dust
• cometary dust
• interplanetary dust
• circumplanetary dust
• stellar nebular condensates
• presolar grains
• micrometeorites
• meteoroids
• meteors
• regolith particles
• planetary aerosols
are the subject of discussion. The meeting is open for any aspects of 
dust research by means of different methods of studies (in-situ and 
laboratory measurements, astronomical observations, laboratory and 
numerical simulations, theoretical modeling, data analyses, etc.). All 
dust-related topics, for example, the formation of molecules and their 
reactions on and their desorption from the surface of dust particles, 
are also welcome. Publishing the proceedings of this meeting is 
currently planned as a special issue of a peer-reviewed journal, while 
paper submission to the proceedings is not obligatory.

ADMISSIONS APPLICATION:
Please complete online meeting application at the CPS website in order 
to attend the meeting. The deadline for the application is May 13, 2015, 
11:59 p.m. Japan Standard Time (GMT+09:00). Because the number of 
participants is limited to a maximum of 50, the online application does 
not guarantee admission to the meeting. Participants will be determined 
at the discretion of the SOC and all applicants will be notified of the 
admissions decision by May 31, 2015. Priority will be given to those who 
contribute to oral or poster sessions and retain enthusiasm for 
discussions throughout the meeting. For further details, please visit 
the Cosmic Dust website.

REGISTRATION FEE:
The early bird rate of 10,000 JPY is available for those who complete 
both admissions application and abstract submission by April 30, 2015. 
The registration fee for those who complete admissions application on 
and after May 1, 2015 is 15,000 JPY. While no payment is required at the 
time of admissions application and abstract submission, the registration 
fee should be paid by cash on arrival at the venue. No matter what 
circumstances are specified, the registration fee will not be waived.

BRIEF HISTORY:
The Cosmic Dust meeting started in 2006 as a session called “Cosmic 
Dust” of the 3rd AOGS (Asia-Oceania Geoscience Society) annual meeting 
in Singapore. Dust freaks have kept on organizing the session at 
subsequent AOGS meetings in Korea (2008), India (2010), and Taiwan 
(2011). The Cosmic Dust series has been recognized as the most 
successful session of the AOGS Planetary Sciences Section. In 2012, the 
time was ripe to be free from organizing restrictions on the AOGS 
meeting. From that time on, the Cosmic Dust meeting is totally 
independent of any international conference. The past meetings on Cosmic 
Dust have been held in a relaxed and joyful atmosphere. So will be the 
coming one!￼
