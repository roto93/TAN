NTHU astronomy colloquium - Friday, October 24 2014, 14:00-15:00, R620

Dr. Chao-Chin Yang (Lund Univ, Finland)
Title: Stumbling Blocks of Planet Formation

Abstract: In contrast to almost two thousand extrasolar planet
candidates detected over the past couple of decades, the theoretical
consideration presents itself many difficulties in the course of
planet formation.  I will review several of these difficulties and
discuss some of their possible solutions.  Specifically, I will
present: (1) the problematic fast inward migration of earth-sized
planets in a gaseous protoplanetary disk; (2) the probability of
collisional destruction between kilometer-sized planetesimals within a
turbulent environment; and (3) how the frictional drag between gas and
solid materials could concentrate the latter fast enough to overcome
the constant angular momentum loss experienced by meter-sized objects.

We examine one of the implications of the Lin-Shu spiral density-wave
theory, specifically, the noncircular systematic motion of the Galactic
objects. The ordinary equations of the Oort-Lindblad theory of galactic
differential rotation are used.
The minor effects caused by the two-dimensional tightly-wound density waves
are also taken into account. The published data of currently known
Cepheids, open clusters and HII regions are collected from Ngeow (2012),
Dias et al. (2012) and Hou et al. (2014).
The most noteworthy result is the fact that the parameters of density waves
estimated from two independent line-of-sight and  transversal velocities
are nearly equal. We argue that the resemblance of these Galactic wave
structures is so remarkable that no doubt is felt as to the theory's truth
with respect to these data. The results obtained allow us to conclude that
several trailing  Lin-Shu type density-wave patterns with different number
of spiral arms, pitch angles and amplitudes of the perturbing gravitational
potential may coexist in the Galaxy. The latter suggests the asymmetric
multiarm, not well-organized spiral structure of the system under the
question.
