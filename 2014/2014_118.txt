*** Colloquium
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Geoffrey Bower (ASIAA)
Topic:        Two Serendipitous Probes of Sagittarius A*: The Galactic Center Pulsar and The G2 Gas Cloud
Time:        7/16 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
High resolution very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) images of nearby massive black holes have the power to address fundamental questions about the physics of black holes. This includes the most accurate constraints on the mass density of the black hole, detection of the black hole spin, and exploration of extensions to general relativity (GR). In particular, Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations will probe Sgr A* and M87, the two sources with the largest angular diameter black holes on the sky, over the coming years with increasing sensitivity and accuracy in imaging. Unfortunately, we do not fully understand the physical processes that are driving accretion and outflow in these sources. To address the fundamental black hole physics questions, we need to develop a deeper knowledge of the astrophysics of these sources. The periastron passage of the G2 gas cloud with Sgr A* at ~1000 Schwarzschild in Spring of 2014 gives us an unprecedented opportunity to study a wide 
range of astrophysical models for accretion and outflow. I describe here observations from millimeter to X-ray wavelengths that enable us to create the necessary context for understanding physics at a few Schwarzschild radii. These include centimeter wavelength VLBI, millimeter polarimetry, and light curve analysis. The serendipitous discovery of the Galactic Center magnetar, SGR 1745-29, has provided a powerful new probe of the Galactic Center environment, including the gas density, magnetic field strength, and nature of the interstellar scattering screen. The discovery also raises important questions about the detectability of pulsars in close orbit to Sgr A* and the pulsar population in the Galactic Center overall.

Topic:        Hydrodynamical Escape Approximation for Pluto
Time:        7/15 (Tuesday) 13:30 - 14:30
Place:        R1108
Abstract:
Hydrodynamic escape problem is to understand the atmosphere of  steady state. The escape flux of gas is concerned and the gas may be collisionless beyond the thermal exobase of the atmosphere. Although the hydrodynamical assumption may fail in theory, this study is to explore the approximation solution for Pluto simulated by the relaxation method is still accurate and reliable through the comparison with some other simulations. The hydrodynamic solution still could approximate the situation of the rare gas for Pluto.

Please note that this research is with Mao-Chang Liang and  Ronald E. Taam.

Dear All,

Forwarding a call for papers. A conference is organizing
a special issue for cosmic dust. Any one can submit a
paper and the journal is refereed.

Regards,
Hiro

-------- Original Message --------

Call for Papers: Planetary and Space Science
Special Issue on Cosmic Dust VII

The 7th meeting on Cosmic Dust (Cosmic Dust VII) is held at Umeda 
Satellite Campus of Osaka Sangyo University, Osaka, Japan from Monday, 
August 4, 2014 through Friday, August 8, 2014. This special issue of 
Planetary and Space Science will be primarily devoted to Cosmic Dust VII 
and contain the papers presented at this particular meeting. However, it 
is also open to submission of any other papers that discuss some aspect 
of cosmic dust. All kinds of cosmic dust are the subject of discussion. 
Papers on dust-related topics, for example, the formation of molecules 
and their reactions on and their desorption from the surface of cosmic 
dust, are also welcome.

In particular, the topic of interest includes but is not limited to

• intergalactic dust
• interstellar dust
• protoplanetary disk dust
• debris disk dust
• cometary dust
• interplanetary dust
• circumplanetary dust
• stellar nebular condensates
• presolar grains
• micrometeorites
• meteoroids
• meteors
• regolith particles
• planetary aerosols

SUBMISSION FORMAT AND GUIDLINE:
All submitted papers must be clearly written in excellent English and 
contain only original work, which has not been published by or is 
currently under review for any other journal or conference. A detailed 
submission guideline is available as “Guide to Authors” at:
http://www.journals.elsevier.com/planetary-and-space-science/

All manuscripts and any supplementary material should be submitted 
through Elsevier Editorial System (EES). The authors must select as “SI: 
Cosmic Dust VII” when they reach the “Article Type” step in the 
submission process. The EES website is located at:
http://ees.elsevier.com/pss/

All papers will be peer-reviewed by two independent reviewers. Requests 
for additional information should be addressed to the guest editors 
<dust-inquiries@cps-jp.org>.

GUEST EDITORS:
Hiroshi Kimura (Kobe Univ., Japan)
Ludmilla Kolokolova (Univ. of Maryland, USA)
Aigen Li (Univ. of Missouri, USA)
Jean-Charles Augereau (IPAG, France)
Hidehiro Kaneda (Nagoya Univ., Japan)

Dear Colleagues,

We wish to draw your attention to an upcoming Call for Proposals for the Submillimeter Array (SMA), the reconfigurable interferometric array of eight 6-m antennas on Mauna Kea jointly built and operated by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory and the Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics.  The array operates in the 230 GHz, 345 GHz and 420 GHz bands.

The deadline for proposal submission for the coming semester (2014B: 16 Nov 2014 - 15 May 2015) is 07 August 2014. The SMA Observer Center website (http://sma1.sma.hawaii.edu) is expected to open for accepting proposals in mid July, 2014.

Best wishes,

Qizhou Zhang
SMA TAC Chair
