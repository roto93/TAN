Dear colleagues,

This is the 2nd circular of  the HSC-AGN face-to-face meeting
at ASIAA in December, just after the PFS collaboration meeting.
If you would like to participate in this meeting, please complete
your registration (through the webform) and hotel reservation
(using a separate reservation form) by 9th October.

Thanks,
Tohru Nagao





Second Circular:
Evolution of SMBHs with HSC: First results from initial dataset


-------------------------------
18th (Thu) - 20th (Sat) December 2014
Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Academia Sinica (ASIAA),
Taipei, Taiwan
http://phys.koshigaya.bunkyo.ac.jp/HSC-SMBH2014/
http://events.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/meeting/20141218/
-------------------------------


This is the second circular of our workshop, that is dedicated for
intensive face-to-face discussion among AGN/SMBH researchers
participating in the Hyper Suprime Cam (HSC) collaboration.
We will focus on doing science and writing papers based on the
first-year data of the HSC-SSP survey. Specifically we will focus
on the following topics:
  -- Current status of the HSC hardware
  -- HSC reduction pipeline, database, and the internal data release
  -- Outcomes of the S14A and S14B runs
  -- Quasar selection methods
  -- AGN photometric redshifts
  -- Statistics of quasars and SMBHs from the HSC data
  -- Co-evolution studies of SMBHs and galaxies with the HSC data
  -- Synergies of HSC and multi-wavelength data for SMBH studies
  -- Strategies for spectroscopic follow-up and the relation with PFS
  -- Theoretical preparations for HSC quasar surveys
  -- Discussion for publications and the S15A runs
  -- Action items for the HSC-SSP 2nd year and beyond that

Now the registration webform is ready. Please visit the following
webpage and make your registration. If you wish to stay at Howard
International House Taipei (the hotel nearest to ASIAA) at a
discount rate, please complete your registration by 9th October
(Thu). You do not necessarily have to complete your abstract
submission at this stage --- the deadline for the abstract
submission is 21st November (not 9th October). However, please
register the workshop even without the presentation information.
You can register your presentation abstract later.

http://events.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/meeting/20141218/registration.php

After completing your registration, please visit the "venue" page
in the ASIAA workshop web and then find a hotel reservation form.
You are kindly requested to fill in the reservation form and send
it to Howard International House Taipei via fax or email by 12th
October, if you need your room in this hotel. If you will
participate both in this HSC-AGN workshop (on 18th - 20th December)
and in the PFS collaboration meeting (that will be held just before
our workshop at the same place, ASIAA in Taipei), please describe
your whole schedule and arrange the hotel during your Taipei stay
in the reservation form.
Even after the deadline (9th October), you can still make your
registration for the workshop. However in this case you have to
book your hotel room(s) by yourself.

Though the total available budget is limited, we will be able to
support travel expenses for some of the participants. The deadline
for the travel support request is also 21st November. The LOC will
contact to you if you request the support, after this deadline.
Also please let the LOC know as soon as possible if you need the
travel visa.
Please feel feee to contact the LOC (tohru@cosmos.ehime-u.ac.jp)
if you have any questions or requests. We are looking forward to
seeing you in Taipei!
