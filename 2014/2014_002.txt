Dear Colleagues,

You are cordially invited to attend the Joint Colloquium which will be held
on December 31 (http://web.phys.ntu.edu.tw/colloquium/), the last one of
this semester.

The Joint Colloquium Series is organized by the NTU Physics Department,
Center for Condensed Matter Science (CCMS), Leung Center for Cosmology and
Particle Astrophysics (LeCosPA), Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and
Astrophysics (ASIAA), and the Institute of Atomic and Molecular Sciences
(IAMS).

The idea is to have excellent speakers to give inspiring, informative, but
non-technical talks on the frontiers of Sciences.

Enclosed below is the information of the Joint Colloquium on December 31.

Best regards,

Yen-Ting Lin (ASIAA)
Michitoshi Hayashi (CCMS)
Chia-Lung Hsieh (IAMS)
Jiwoo Nam (LeCosPA)
Juinn-Wei Chen (NTU-Phys)

ASIAA/CCMS/IAMS/LeCosPA/NTU-Physics Joint Colloquium

Speaker: Jhih-Wei Chu

              (National Chiao Tung University)

Topic :  *Special Seminar for 2013 Nobel Chemistry Prize: The Past,
Current, and Future of Multiscale **Simulation*

Time  : 12/31 (Tue.) 14:20 - 15:20

Place : Room 104, CCMS-New Physics Building

Abstract:
    In this talk, I will present the history and my perspectives of the
Nobel chemistry prize announced earlier this year. The background for the
development of multiscale simulation methods, the ideas and implementation
being formed, and the impact of these researches will be addressed. The
context for the discussion of which will include some of my research
endeavors. I will also remark on the current status and future perspectives
of multiscale simulation in chemistry, physics, and biology from my point
of view.

Brief Bio:
    Professor Jhih-Wei Chu is a world leading expert in using computers to
simulate biosystems. He is interested in understanding how a complex system
acquires functionalities from its building blocks and their structures and
dynamics. In the meantime, he also develops multiscale computational
schemes to make such simulations possible.
    Prof. Chu got his BS degree from the Chemical Engineering department of
NTU, Ph. D from MIT and after a postdoc term at Utah, he joined the faculty
Berkeley in 2006. He came back to Taiwan from Berkeley this year. Now he is
professor of Biological Science and Technology at National Chiao Tung
University.
    He has received several prestigious awards, including the International
Outstanding Junior Scholars, Foundation for the Advancement of Outstanding
Scholarship in 2013; Chancellor's Faculty Partnership Award, UC Berkeley in
2009; and the Hewlett-Packard Outstanding Junior Faculty Award in 2007.
