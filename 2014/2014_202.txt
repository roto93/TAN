Speaker:    Tim Davis (University of Hertfordshire)
Topic:         Re-fueling dead galaxies; star-formation and black-holes
Time:         12/22 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
Recently, massive early-type galaxies have shed their 'red-and-dead' moniker, thanks to the discovery that many host residual star formation. I will show how observations of the cold and warm ISM, combined with simulations and models, can be used to shed light on the mysterious origin of the material which regenerates red-sequence galaxies and changes their late-time evolution. I will then show that star formation in these objects is dynamically suppressed, leading to stars forming with a much lower efficiency than in spiral/starburst galaxies. Star formation is also suppressed in ETGs which have undergone a recent minor merger. These dynamical processes that suppress star formation are likely to be important in other galactic nuclei, and perhaps even in our own Milky Way. Finally I will show that molecular gas is an excellent kinematic tracer, providing a powerful tool for both studying the large scale mass distribution in galaxies (e.g. with the CO Tully Fisher relation), a
nd probing dark objects lurking at the hearts of galaxies. I will show using high-resolution interferometric observations that one can resolve molecular gas kinematics within the sphere of influence of local supermassive black-holes, and present the first ever black-hole mass measured in this manner.



*** Special Seminar ***

Speaker:    Chi-Ting Chiang (MPA)
Topic:         Position-dependent power spectrum and the application to the BOSS DR10 CMASS sample
Time:         12/23 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
The influence of large-scale density fluctuations on structure formation on small scales is described by the three-point correlation function (bispectrum) in the so-called “squeezed configurations.” This bispectrum is generated by non-linear gravitational evolution and possibly also by inflationary physics. We show that the sqeezed-limit bispectrum can be measured without employing three-point function estimators. Specifically, we use the “position-dependent power spectrum,” i.e., the power spectrum measured in smaller subvolumes of the survey (or simulation box), and correlate it with the mean overdensity of the corresponding subvolume. This correlation directly measures an integral of the bispectrum dominated by the squeezed configurations. Measuring this correlation is only slightly more complex than measuring the power spectrum itself, and sidesteps the considerable complexity of the full bispectrum estimation. We apply this technique to the BOSS DR10 CMASS sample
. Combining the two- and three-point correlation functions, we break the degeneracies between the linear bias, growth rate, and sigma8, and put constraints on these parameters.
