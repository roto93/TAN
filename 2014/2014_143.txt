*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Min-Su Shin (University of Oxford)
Topic:         Applications of machine learning algorithms for reliable
detection of groups in astronomical data
Time:         10/1 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
Due to increasing size of astronomical data and expected
boom of survey projects, it becomes important to detect
interesting objects reliably in the large amount of data.
I explain the importance of applying machine learning
algorithms in future astronomical research. Focusing on
application of clustering algorithms to detect groups in data,
I introduce a non-parametric Bayesian clustering method
and a consensus clustering method which improve reliability
of detecting genuine variable sources in time-series astronomical
data. I also present a new strategy of time-series data
analysis to identify variable sources quickly by using ensemble
of clustering methods as the data size grows. Possible applications
of the non-parametric Bayesian method are presented for theoretical
and observational astronomical research, emphasizing the role of
data-driven models.
