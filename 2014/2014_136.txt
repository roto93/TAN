Arizona Radio Observatory: Call for Proposals (Fall 2014)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Astronomers in Taiwan,

Observing proposals from members of the University Consortium of ALMA-Taiwan
(UCAT) and ASIAA for the 10-meter Sub-Millimeter Telescope (SMT), located on
Mount Graham, Arizona, of the Arizona Radio Observatory (ARO) are being
solicited for the period October 15, 2014 to January 15, 2015. Proposals will
also be accepted on a limited shared-risk basis for the new ALMA Prototype
12-meter Telescope (12m) located on Kitt Peak, Arizona. The proposal deadline
of UCAT/ASIAA for this 2014 fall semester is set on September 26, 2014 (Friday).

The SMT currently supports a dual-polarization, 1-mm (211-275 GHz) receiver with
ALMA Band 6 sideband-separating (SBS) mixers, a dual-polarization 0.8-mm
(320-370 GHz) receiver, a dual-polarization 0.7 mm (420-500 GHz) SIS receiver
with SBS mixers, and a 0.4-mm (602-720 GHz) dual-polarization receiver with ALMA
Band 9 mixers. The SMT control system supports both dual-polarization ("2 IF
mode"), and dual-polarization, dual-sideband observations ("4 IF mode"), as well
as OTF mapping. The new 12m will support an ALMA Band 3 dual-polarization SBS
receiver (84-116 GHz) for this season.

Remote observing is available. Observers who plan to observe remotely must
supply fixed IP address(es) of the computer(s) that will be used during
observing on their Proposal Summary Sheet. Information about Remote Observing
can be viewed at: at http://aro.as.arizona.edu/remote/remote.htm. Graduate
student participation is especially encouraged. For further information about
remote observing and operational questions, please contact Tom Folkers,
Operations Manager at tfolkers@email.arizona.edu.

Proposers should consult the ARO website, http://aro.as.arizona.edu/, for 
technical specifications and to download updated Proposal Summary Sheet
templates here: http://aro.as.arizona.edu/proposal_submission_information.htm.
Proposal candidates are required to list on the Proposal Summary Sheet their
requested observing blocks (LST ranges), dates on which they are NOT available
to observe, and dates in which sources in those observing blocks are within the
Sun-avoidance zone (44 degrees at the SMT).

Proposals should consist of:
1.  A Proposal Summary Sheet.
2.  A brief scientific and technical justification (no more than 2 pages).
3.  A source list with observing time requirements and justification, and/or
    tables, figures and references (no more than 1 page in total).

Electronic submissions will be accepted in PDF format ONLY. Scheduling of
successful proposals will be done according to availability of the receivers
requested. The final proposal pdf file should be emailed to
kuan@ asiaa.sinica.edu.tw by midnight (23:59 pm CST) September 26, 2014
(Friday).


Kind regards,
Yi-Jehng Kuan
on behalf of UCAT's ARO TAC

Dear Colleagues

The CosPA 2014 conference (Cosmology and Particle Astrophysics) will be 
held in Auckland, New Zealand from December 9-12 this year.  

CosPA brings together theorists, experimentalists and observers working in 
the fields of cosmology and particle astrophysics to discuss the latest 
data, theoretical results, and possibilities for future progress.  

CosPA is held annually in the Asia-Pacific region. This will be the 11th 
meeting in the series; conferences in the series have been held in Hawaii, 
Melbourne, Tokyo, Beijing, Pohang, Hsinchu and Taipei.  

The conference will include both plenary and parallel sessions, focussing 
on experimental and theoretical cosmology, large scale structure, particle 
astrophysics, dark matter, dark energy and theoretical and experimental 
particle physics.    

Registration and abstract submission is now open -- we hope we will see 
you in Auckland!  

Yours truly, 
Richard Easther, for the Organising Committee
r.easther@auckland.ac.nz

*** Special Seminar ***
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Yu-Yen Chang (MPIA)
Topic:         Stellar Masses and Star Formation Rates for 1M Galaxies from SDSS and WISE
Time:         9/9 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
We assemble multi-wavelength photometry for the full SDSS spectroscopic galaxy sample, drawing from the SDSS and WISE surveys, covering the wavelength range 0.4-22 micron. We use the latest modeling techniques to estimate stellar masses and star formation rates. The addition of photometry at > 1 micron improves these measurements as compared to previous SDSS-based estimates. The newly measured star formation rates allow us to test methods to separate early-type (passive) from late-type galaxies (star-forming) galaxies.



*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Chan-Kao Chang (NCU)
Topic:         The intermediate Palomar Transient Factory (iPTF) & the 10k Asteroid Rotation Period (10kARP) Project
Time:         9/10 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
The Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) is a synoptic survey designed to explore the transient and variable sky. The PTF camera, the former CFHT 12k mosaic camera, mounted on Palomar Observatory’s 1.2-m f/2.44 Oschin Schmidt Telescope, uses 11 CCDs (4096 × 2048 each) to observe 7.26 deg2 of the sky at a time with a resolution of 1.01 arcsec/pixel. The project started its operation in 2009 and stepped into its second phase, iPTF, in 2013. The nominal survey is at R-band, but additional observations are also made at g-band and H alpha band. The standard exposure time per frame is 60 seconds, yielding a 3-sigma limiting magnitude of 20.5 and 21 for R- and g-band respectively. The iPTF has carried out various experiments with different cadences, from a 5-day cadence to 90 seconds.

The 10k Asteroid Rotation Period (10kARP) Project is trying to use PTF data to collect 10,000 asteroid rotation periods, from which we try to understand the spin rate distributions for different size asteroids and see whether their distributions are different from their NEA counterparts. In addition, we also try to search super-fast rotator (SFR), which has diameter of several hundreds meter and rotates faster than the “spin barrier” at ∼ 2 hours. Such SFR is very critical to understand the interior structure of asteroid with D>150 m.
