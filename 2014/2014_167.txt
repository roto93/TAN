NTHU astronomy colloquium - Friday, November 7 2014, 14:00-15:00, R620

Speaker: Gregg Hallinan (Caltech)
Title: Space Weather Beyond Our Solar System

Abstract:
Magnetic activity has played a key role in the formation and angular
momentum evolution of our Sun and continues to power its radio and high
energy output. The associated radiative output and magnetized plasma
outflow (solar wind) dominates the local space environment of solar system
planets, including Earth, particularly during flares and CMEs. Radio
observations are a powerful trace of these phenomena, both through the
radio bursts produced during flares and CMEs and the low frequency auroral
radio emission produced by magnetized planets experiencing magnetic storms,
the latter a key diagnostic for the presence and strength of planetary
magnetic fields. I will talk about new experiments at Caltech's Owens
Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO), dedicated to the detection of such space
weather on nearby stellar and planetary systems. These includes the
Starburst program, dedicated to the detection and imaging of coronal mass
ejections on nearby stars, and the Owens Valley Long Wavelength Array,
which aims to detect the auroral radio emissions from nearby exoplanets.
The latter is particularly innovative, consisting of 288 antennas, combined
to image the entire viewable sky every second from 25-85 MHz. This facility
recently saw first light and is currently aiming to provide the first
measurement of magnetic fields on extrasolar planets. Finally, I will also
discuss the recent detection of similar aurorae, both optical and radio,
from brown dwarfs, which has allowed us to place the strongest constraints
yet achieved on dynamo theory in the substellar regime.
