Dear all,

Please find below the first announcement for the SPIRou Science Meeting as discussed during the FDR. Rene Doyon will distribute this announcement on Canada, and I'll do it in France. Could you distribute it in your country if you are outside of Canada or France ?

Cheers.

Xavier



First SPIRou Science Meeting : First annoucement (Paris : 22 - 25 Sept 2014)

SPIRou recently passed its FDR (Final Design Review) and the project is now entering the construction and integration phase (with a first light at CFHT planned for 2017). A SPIRou Legacy Survey (SLS) of ~500 CFHT nights on a timescale of 5 yr is proposed - to be focused on the two main science goals of SPIRou : (i) the quest for habitable Earth-like planets around very-low-mass stars, and (ii) the study of low-mass star & planet formation in the presence of magnetic fields. Although dedicated to the two science goals described above and to tightly connected topics (e.g., the activity and magnetic topologies of M dwarfs), the SLS data will also be very useful for a variety of other science programs of high interest for the whole community.

The observations comprising the SLS are in particular intended to achieve the following objectives: (a) accomplish selected large-scale community-defined scientific programs and (b) provide the community with an extensive, homogenous, well characterized, and high quality database having the potential for a wide range of longlasting scientific applications.

The first SPIRou Science Meeting will be held in Paris (Campus de Jussieu and IAP) on 2014 Sept 22-25. The goal is to initiate science preparation for SPIRou and to iterate with the community on the definition and coordination of the SLS, to update its composition and to nominate its representatives.

The preliminary program of the SPIRou Science Meeting is as follows (a more detailed program will be sent later on and will be available on a SPIRou website) :

- day 1 : Definition of the SPIRou planet search; a Radial Velocity Survey of nearby M-dwarfs. Discussion on survey simulation, sampling, observational strategy, target selection, constraint on planet formation, follow up observations, activity jitter (modelisation, charcacterization, filtering), by-product of the survey, work-package organisation...

- day 2 : Definition of the SPIRou transiting planets follow-up; target selection from TESS/K2/, observational strategy, Rossiter monitoring, constraints on planetary internal structures, complementary observations with JWST / CHEOPS, models of planet atmospheres, work-package organisation...

- day 3 : Definition of magnetic protostars survey; magnetic topologies of class-I, -II and -III protostars, accretion processes in low-mass protostars, hot jupiters around wTTSs, dynamo processes of protostars and M dwarfs, inner regions of accretion discs, work-packages organisations...

- day 4 : 1st half day : other science topics w/ SPIRou (preparation of complementary LP)
2nd half day : discussion on the SLS, organisation, the Data Processing center, the DA and PP, the Work Packages, coordinators, responsibilities…
