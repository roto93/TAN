    Astronomical Society of the Republic of China 2014 Scientific Assembly
                                 (ASROC2014)

           Experimental Forest of National Taiwan University, NanTou
                               May 23 - 25, 2014


The 2014 Scientific Assembly of the Astronomical Society of the Republic of China (ASROC2014) will be held at National Taiwan University Experimental Forest (NTUEF) on 2014 May 23 (Fri) - 25 (Sun). This is the annual event for all astronomers and astrophysicists in Taiwan to report their latest research results and to exchange new ideas. ASROC2014 is also an excellent venue for graduate students to present their research findings or progress from thesis studies.

        The meeting will include plenary talks, scientific and educational sessions, poster presentation, and a business meeting. The featured plenary speakers are 1) Prof. Debra Fischer of Yale University, Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Science. 2) Prof. Neal Evans, the Edward Randall, Jr. Centennial Professor in Astronomy of University of Texas at Austin. Prof. Fisher, a well-known astronomer and one of the pioneers in extrasolar planet search, will give a plenary talk on "How will we find another Earth?." Prof. Evans, a world leading expert in low-mass star formation, will talk about "Progress in understanding the formation of low mass stars."

        In the Assembly, the Society will also present the 1st Heaven Quest Award to Director Paul T.P. Ho of ASIAA for his distinguished contribution to astronomical research, and the 1st Heaven Talk Award to Taipei Astronomical Museum for its outstanding contribution to astronomy education and popularization of astronomy. In addition to the scientific agenda, the afternoon of May 24 (Sat) is reserved for group discussions or group excursions at choice; a conference banquet will be held later in the evening and all meeting participants are welcome to attend. Exhibitions of astronomical books and instruments are also planned during the meeting.

        ASROC2014 website is now open for registration and abstract submission. The deadline for online registration is April 15 and for abstract submission, March 31. Participants of the scientific assembly should submit their abstracts and register on-line. A registration fee of NT$1,000 (NT$800 for students) should be paid on site. The LOC will help to reserve 4-person suite in the student dormitory; participants who would like to use this service should inform the LOC (service@www.asroc.org.tw) before April 15; discount rate is offered for all rooms in the Education Center.

*** Colloquium

Speaker:        Eswaraiah Chakali (NCU)
Topic:          Optical and NIR-polarimetry: a key tool to understand dust grain properties and the importance of magnetic fields in star-formation
Time:           2/26 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Incoming light from a number of distant astronomical sources get polarized due to several astrophysical processes. Among them, differential extinction or dichroism, according to which un-polarized light get linearly polarized due to an ensemble of aligned, non-spherical and spinning dust grains with respect to the Galactic magnetic field, is a promising tool to understand the properties of dust grains and to map the line of sight averaged, plane of the sky magnetic field orientation. Polarimetry of reddened background stars of starless and star- forming regions will be useful to map the magnetic field geometry in and around these regions. Magnetic fields are one of the important constituents of the ISM, and are believed to play an important, perhaps even crucial, role in the formation and evolution of the molecular clouds, their collapse, star-formation in them, and the feed back processes (formation and evolution of outflows, mid-infrared bubbles, and bright rimmed clouds).
 Star-clusters/star-forming regions, and molecular clouds (that are distributed at different distances, reddened by different amount extinction values, characterized by different extinction laws, and having different levels of star- formation activity) were studied using optical and NIR-polarimetry. Field stars and the cluster members have been identified using both optical color-color ((U-B) versus (B-V)) and Stokes plane (Q versus U) diagrams. The distribution and properties of dust grains, distribution of the magnetic field orientation, and the polarization efficiency of the dust grains have been studied. In this colloquium, I will present important results on my past and ongoing research work.

Topic:          Formation of Terrestrial Planets: The Basic Dynamical Model
Time:           2/27 (Thursday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
In the standard scenario for solar system formation, planets forms
from a protoplanetary disk that consists of gas and dust. The
formation scenario can be divided into three stages: (1) formation of
planetesimals from dust, (2) formation of protoplanets from
planetesimals, and (3) formation of planets from protoplanets. In
stage (1), planetesimals form from dust through gravitational
instability of a dust layer or coagulation of dust
grains. Planetesimals are small building blocks of solid
planets. Planetesimals grow by mutual collisions to protoplanets or
planetary embryos through runaway and oligarchic growth in stage
(2). The final stage (3) depends on a type of planets. For terrestrial
planets the final stage is giant impacts among protoplanets while
sweeping residual planetesimals. In the present talk, I review the
basic elementary processes of terrestrial planet formation, showing
N-body simulations and discuss the origin of the diversity of
terrestrial planets.
