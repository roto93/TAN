*** Colloquium
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Naoki Yoshida (University of Tokyo)
Topic:        Matter distribution around galaxies and the nature of dark matter
Time:        5/14 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
Gravitational lensing is a powerful method to probe matter distribution in the universe.
We combine large observational data from SDSS and CFHTLens and cosmological
simulations to study the distribution of dark matter around galaxies. Our method can
be used to "measure" the mass of dark matter halos that host SDSS main galaxies,
to derive cosmological parameters such as Omega_matter, and to place constraints
on the annihilation cross-section of dark matter. For the latter study, we also use
data from the Fermi all-sky gamma-ray map. Ongoing wide-field surveys, most
notably Subaru-HSC, will significantly improve the above estimates and constraints.
I discuss theoretical challenges to use the large set of data in the coming few years.

Topic:        The dark ages of the universe
Time:        5/13 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:        Physics 104
Abstract:
One of the milestones in the cosmic history is the formation of the first generation of stars and hydrogen reionization.
The standard theory of cosmic structure formation predicts that the first stars were born about a few hundred million
years after the Big Bang. The dark Universe was then lit up once again, and eventually filled with ultraviolet photons
emitted from stars and galaxies. Recent astronomical observations discovered distant galaxies and super-massive
blackholes that were in place when the age of the universe was less than one billion years old.
How were the galaxies formed, and what are the origin of the massive blackholes? The key to these interesting question
lies probably in the formation of the first stars. I present the results from super-computer simulations that follow
self-consistently the formation of protostars through to the early stages of a main-sequence star with thermonuclear
burning. The characteristic mass of the first stars is estimated from such simulations. I discuss implications for
the formation of early blackholes and Galactic metal-poor stars. Finally I propose to use future wide-field infrared surveys
to detect the supernova explosions of the first stars.
