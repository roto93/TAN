*** Colloquium ***

Speaker:    Colette Salyk (NOAO)
Topic:         Observing the Formation of Planetary Diversity
Time:         10/8 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
Planets and planetary systems are incredibly diverse, as evidenced by the unique planets of our solar system, and the large variety of exoplanetary systems.  How did this diversity develop?  I will discuss our current understanding of how a unified planet formation scenario can explain such an array of planets, and describe the protoplanetary disk observations I have been performing to test these ideas.  I will focus in particular on observations of disk chemistry, including its challenges, exciting advances, and future prospects.
