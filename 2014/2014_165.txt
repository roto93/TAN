                            tuCASA - ASIAA
              ALMA Community Day and CASA Workshop 2014


The UCAT Center for ALMA Science Advancement (tuCASA) and the Academia Sinica
Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA) are pleased to announce that
an ALMA Community Day together with a two-day CASA workshop will be held at the
Science Campus of National Taiwan Normal University on November 15 and 22, 2014.


CASA Workshop
_____________

The main purpose of the CASA Workshop, which is organized by tuCASA and
cosponsored by ALMA Regional Center of Taiwan (ARC-Taiwan) of ASIAA, is to help
potential ALMA users to familiarize themselves with CASA (Common Astronomy
Software Applications) package for the post-processing of the ALMA data.
Faculty, research staff and graduate students of UCAT (University Consortium of
ALMA-Taiwan) who are interested in using ALMA data for their research but have
little knowledge of CASA package are particularly welcome.

    The workshop format will be short lectures interlaced with hands-on
exercises basically. The detailed program can be found at
    http://140.122.162.144/tuCASA/CASA2014_wksp/program/ 

    Participants are required to bring along with you a notebook computer
running on either Mac OS or Linux, and please have the CASA program "CASA 4.2.2"
and "CASA User Reference & Cookbook 4.2.2" downloaded in advance at
    http://casa.nrao.edu/casa_obtaining.shtml 

    Please also have the dataset "CASA2014_data.zip" readily downloaded prior to
the workshop from
    http://140.122.162.144/tuCASA/CASA2014_wksp/ALMA_data/CASA2014_data.zip 


ALMA Community Day
__________________

The major goal of the ALMA Community Day, organized by ARC-T of ASIAA and
cosponsored by tuCASA, is to make better ALMA science and better ALMA proposals.
The ALMA Community Day will focus on:  1) to update Taiwan community the status
of ALMA and other radio facilities, including JCMT, CSO and SMA, that
astronomers in Taiwan have access to;  2) to improve ALMA proposals from Taiwan;
3) to attract more non-radio astronomers to use the ALMA.

    In addition, we will learn how to search for and identify ALMA archival
data, including ALMA Science Verification (SV) data and Cycle-0 & Cycle-1 data,
that we may be interested in working on. We will also discuss all practical
concerns for ALMA archival data retrieval. Participants who know their target
sources beforehand or have clear science goals in mind are encouraged to
contact Dr. Kuo-Song Wang directly before November 7 so Dr. Wang
(kswang@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw) may help you to locate appropriate datasets more
effectively. If you do want to download ALMA archival datasets to work on for
actual research, a 1-on-1 tutorial on data retrieval is available on November
15, please register first.

    Proposal MOCK Review is also available on November 22 for a 1-on-1
discussion on your unsuccessful proposals in previous cycles. Please register
first and send your proposals to almamock@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw by November 15.


Dates and Venue
_______________

November 15 and November 22 (Saturdays) at Rm S101 of the Research Building
(教學研究大樓) on the Science Campus of National Taiwan Normal University (師大分部).

NTHU astronomy colloquium - Friday, October 24 2014, 14:00-15:00, R620

Dr. Chao-Chin Yang (Lund Univ, Finland)
Title: Stumbling Blocks of Planet Formation

Abstract: In contrast to almost two thousand extrasolar planet
candidates detected over the past couple of decades, the theoretical
consideration presents itself many difficulties in the course of
planet formation.  I will review several of these difficulties and
discuss some of their possible solutions.  Specifically, I will
present: (1) the problematic fast inward migration of earth-sized
planets in a gaseous protoplanetary disk; (2) the probability of
collisional destruction between kilometer-sized planetesimals within a
turbulent environment; and (3) how the frictional drag between gas and
solid materials could concentrate the latter fast enough to overcome
the constant angular momentum loss experienced by meter-sized objects.

NTHU astronomy colloquium - Friday, October 31 2014, 14:00-15:00, R620

Prof. Uri (Evgeny) Griv (Ben-Gurion University, Beer-Sheva, Israel)

We examine one of the implications of the Lin-Shu spiral density-wave
theory, specifically, the noncircular systematic motion of the Galactic
objects. The ordinary equations of the Oort-Lindblad theory of galactic
differential rotation are used.
The minor effects caused by the two-dimensional tightly-wound density waves
are also taken into account. The published data of currently known
Cepheids, open clusters and HII regions are collected from Ngeow (2012),
Dias et al. (2012) and Hou et al. (2014).
The most noteworthy result is the fact that the parameters of density waves
estimated from two independent line-of-sight and  transversal velocities
are nearly equal. We argue that the resemblance of these Galactic wave
structures is so remarkable that no doubt is felt as to the theory's truth
with respect to these data. The results obtained allow us to conclude that
several trailing  Lin-Shu type density-wave patterns with different number
of spiral arms, pitch angles and amplitudes of the perturbing gravitational
potential may coexist in the Galaxy. The latter suggests the asymmetric
multiarm, not well-organized spiral structure of the system under the
question.

Apologies for the multiple emails this week.  FYI, there will also be the
following special seminar next week on Thursday:

*** Special Seminar ***
____________________________________________________
Speaker:      Kiyo Masui (University of British Columbia)
Topic:          Large-scale structure with the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity
Mapping Experiment (CHIME)
Time:          10/30 (Thursday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:          R1203

The Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) proposes to map
the large-scale structure of the Universe in three dimensions by detecting
the redshifted 21 cm emission from neutral hydrogen. I will introduce the
CHIME instrument, its science goals, and some of the challenges it faces
going forward with a focus on data analysis.
