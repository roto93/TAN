NTHU astronomy colloquium

Speaker: Chao-Chin Yang (Lund Univ.)

Title: Stumbling Blocks of Planet Formation

Abstract: In contrast to almost two thousand extrasolar planet
candidates detected over the past couple of decades, the theoretical
consideration presents itself many difficulties in the course of
planet formation.  I will review several of these difficulties and
discuss some of their possible solutions.  Specifically, I will
present: (1) the problematic fast inward migration of earth-sized
planets in a gaseous protoplanetary disk; (2) the probability of
collisional destruction between kilometer-sized planetesimals within a
turbulent environment; and (3) how the frictional drag between gas and
solid materials could concentrate the latter fast enough to overcome
the constant angular momentum loss experienced by meter-sized objects.
