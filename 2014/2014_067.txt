*** Colloquium
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Chiranjib Konar (ASIAA)
Topic:        Jet and accretion physics in radio galaxies: theory vs. observations
Time:        4/16 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
Radio galaxies are the good laboratories to study the AGN accretion
and jet physics. Hundred-kpc scale radio galaxies can be hosted by
spirals too. They can be episodic in jet activity. In our recent work
we have made progress in addressing some of the fundamental questions
related to the jet physics and the cause of episodic jet formations
in radio loud AGNs. All episodic radio galaxies in our sample show
two episodes. I will discuss about what is the most consistent model
for the particle acceleration at the jet shocks. I will emphasize how
the application of jet dynamics and particle acceleration physics
leads to various interesting and important conclusions related to
extragalactic jets. I will also discuss the mode of accretion in 
the episodic radio galaxies and present our recent results extracted  
from X-ray (XMM), SDSS and WISE data.
