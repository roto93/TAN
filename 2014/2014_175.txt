Speaker:    Ti-Lin Chou (ASIAA)
Topic:         Transition from the Infalling Envelope to the Keplerian Disk around L1551 IRS 5
Time:         11/10 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
We present combined SMA+ASTE images of the Class I protobinary L1551 IRS 5 in the CS (J = 7--6) line, the submillimeter images of L1551 IRS 5 with the most complete spatial sampling ever achieved (0â€³.9 -- 36â€³). The SMA image of L1551 IRS 5 in the 343 GHz dust-continuum emission is also presented, which shows an elongated feature along the northwest to southeast direction (âˆ¼160 AU Ã— 80 AU), perpendicular to the associated radio jets. The combined SMA+ASTE images show that the high-velocity (â‰³1.5 km sâˆ’1) CS emission traces the structure of the dust component and shows a velocity gradient along the major axis, which is reproduced by a geometrically-thin Keplerian-disk model with a central stellar mass of âˆ¼0.5 MâŠ™. The low-velocity (â‰²1.3 km sâˆ’1) CS emission shows an extended (âˆ¼1000 AU) feature that exhibits slight south (blueshifted) to north (redshifted) emission offsets, which is modeled with a rotating and infalling envelope with a conserved angular momentu
m. The rotational motion of the envelope connects smoothly to the inner Keplerian rotation at a radius of âˆ¼64 AU. The infalling velocity of the envelope is âˆ¼three times lower than the free-fall velocity toward the central stellar mass of 0.5 MâŠ™. These results demonstrate transition from the infalling envelope to the Keplerian disk, consistent with the latest theoretical studies of disk formation. We suggest that sizable (râˆ¼50--200 AU) Keplerian disks are already formed when the protostars are still deeply embedded in the envelopes.


*** Colloquium ***

Speaker:    Claudio Grillo (University of Copenhagen)
Topic:         The dark-matter haloes of massive galaxies and clusters of galaxies
Time:         11/11 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
The physics of gravitational light deflection, or gravitational lensing, offers a great variety of applications in several fields of astrophysics. In particular, in the strong lensing regime, observations of multiple images of background sources created by intervening mass concentrations provide a unique opportunity of measuring very precisely the total mass of these intervening lenses. The combination of strong gravitational lensing and stellar population models has turned out to be an invaluable tool to disentangle the luminous and dark-matter components in the inner regions of distant galaxies and clusters of galaxies. I will show how, by using these techniques on unprecedented data obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope and the Very Large Telescope, we have been able to investigate the properties of the dark-matter haloes and subhaloes of massive lens early-type galaxies and galaxy clusters in the CASSOWARY and CLASH surveys.
