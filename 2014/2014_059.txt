Dear Colleagues,

You are cordially invited to attend the Joint Colloquium which will be held on April 1 (http://web.phys.ntu.edu.tw/colloquium/).

The Joint Colloquium Series is organized by the NTU Physics Department, Center for Condensed Matter Science (CCMS), Leung Center for Cosmology and Particle Astrophysics (LeCosPA), Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA), and the Institute of Atomic and Molecular Sciences (IAMS).

The idea is to have excellent speakers to give inspiring, informative, but non-technical talks on the frontiers of Sciences.

Enclosed below is the information of the Joint Colloquium on  April 1.

Best regards,

Yen-Ting Lin (ASIAA)
Michitoshi Hayashi (CCMS)
Chia-Lung Hsieh (IAMS)
Jiwoo Nam (LeCosPA)
Yuan-Huei Chang (NTU-Phys)

ASIAA/CCMS/IAMS/LeCosPA/NTU-Physics Joint Colloquium

Speaker: Chao-Lin Kuo
        (Stanford University)

Topic :  BICEP2 Results, Implications, and Future

Time  : 04/01 (Tue.) 14:20 - 15:20

Place : Room 204, CCMS-New Physics Building

Abstract:
    The BICEP2 team has just announced the detection of degree-scale B-mode polarization of the CMB, consistent with the imprint of inflationary gravitational waves. r=0 model is ruled out at very high significance. BICEP2 is the second generation in the BICEP/Keck series of small refractor experiments. I will discuss the immediate prospect of confirming and expanding BICEP2's discovery by Keck Array and BICEP3. A dedicated program that covers more sky can significantly reduce the uncertainties on tensor amplitude, putting models of inflation to further test.

Brief Bio:
    Prof. Chao-Lin Kuo received his Bachelor degree from NTU Physics Department in 1994 and Ph.D. in Astrophysics from U.C. Berkeley in 2003. After a postdoctoral fellowship at Caltech/JPL, he is currently Assistant Professor of Physics at Stanford University and SLAC. Prof. Kuo studies the polarization of the most ancient light, the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation, emitted when the universe was in its infancy. The polarization in the CMB contains information on the birth of the universe (big bang/inflation), as well as its subsequent evolution. 
    Prof. Kuo is involved in both cosmological interpretation and instrumentation/technology development, focusing on experiments including BICEP/BICEP2/Keck Array/POLAR Array. He is an expert in advanced experimental techniques, such as cryogenics, superconductivity, and micromachining, for maximizing detector sensitivity to the faint CMB signal. Prof. Kuo has been awarded an Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellowship in 2009, an MRI (Major Research Instrumentation) grant in 2010, and an NSF Faculty Early CAREER Award in 2011.
