Dear Taiwan Astrophysics Colleagues,

Happy New Year of the Horse.

A colleague requested to have a message broadcast to the related physics communities in Taiwan.

Please refer to the attached message, on a call of application to visit the Aspen Center in summer 2014. The sender is a professor of physics in UCLA, in her capacity as Diversity Committee chair at ACP.

As you can see, the context is: the person responsible to promote and provide support to a diversified user-community at Aspen is requesting applications seven days prior to the deadline. And Aspen does not strong component of astro-flavored programs.

Feel free to forward the information to other interested physics colleagues in Taiwan.

Best Regards,
Henry Wong 王子敬
Institute of Physics, Academia Sinica

> Subject: help to get more physicists from Taiwan to apply to Aspen Center for Physics workshops- financial help now available

Dear Prof Wong, first of all very happy new year for you and your loved ones!

I am writing to you now because I am involved with the Aspen Center for Physics, in Aspen, Colorado, USA (I am the chair of the ``Diversity" committee this year, in particular) and I would like to make sure that we get more applicants to the summer workshops from people from countries from which we get very few
participants, and Taiwan is one of them.

The Center is an excellent place to get in contact and start collaborations with other physicists, mostly because of all the unstructured time for informal contacts it provides. However, coming to the Aspen Center is costly and this discourages many people to apply. But now there is a good opportunity. There is a foundation, the Simons Foundation, which has given 100 k dollars per year for 5 years to the Aspen Center for Physics to finance the visit of participants to the workshops from underrepresented countries (this is the second year of the grant). The condition is that the money available for science in the country is below a certain range, and Taiwan does qualify. I wonder if you could forward the message to people in Taiwan who you think maybe interested, or maybe post it somewhere. In fact, if you have any suggestion of other people or websites in Taiwan I could contact for this purpose, please let me know. The minimum stay for theorists is two weeks and for experime!
ntalists is one week.

The information about the summer workshops is at

http://www.aspenphys.org/physicists/summer/index.html

The information about the grant in ACP the website is:

``The Simons Foundation has generously provided funds to support physicists coming from countries where science funding is not strong or from economically disadvantaged countries. All physicists who would like to participate at the Aspen Center for Physics apply before January 31 of the year preceding the summer they would like to attend. The admissions process is rigorous due to the large number of applications. This results in a 60\% acceptance rate. Physicists do not apply for the Simons grant. If the country in which they are working is one that will be supported that year, the physicists will receive letters of acceptance that include information about Simons funding. The Simons grant pays for an accepted individual's registration fee, shared housing while in Aspen (one's own room in a two- or three-bedroom apartment), and a portion of air travel, which will vary from year to year, but will not cover all of one's travel
expenses. "

The houses in Aspen are gorgeous so the accommodation in a house is very good. Each room has a separate bathroom, the kitchens are large and fully equipped, and the Aspen Center lends bicycles or people can take the public free transportation the City of Aspen provides across town to go around (the city is small).

The application deadline is January 31st and it only takes a moment:

http://www.aspenphys.org/physicists/summer/program/applications.html

The Aspen Center not only accepts people for workshops but also by individual research groups of a few people, and even isolated researchers. But applying to a workshop is the most common way to apply. We would like your help to encourage people from Taiwan to apply (it is not sure that they will get in, the
acceptance is on scientific grounds exclusively, but applying is the first step).

Thanks for your help. This is somewhat urgent now because we have only one week before the deadline.

Best regards, Graciela
