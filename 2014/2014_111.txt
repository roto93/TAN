******************************************************************

The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) has been producing a growing number of impressive and scientifically compelling results as the most powerful mm/submm interferometer in the world. Held in central Tokyo, the aim of this four day conference is to highlight the most recent science results from ALMA obtained during the first three years of science operations, and to motivate future collaboration among researchers around the world. The science topic includes all fields of astronomy; cosmology and galaxies in the distant universe, nearby galaxies and the Galactic Center, ISM and star formation in our own galaxy, astrochemistry, circumstellar disks, exoplanets, solar system, stellar evolution and the Sun. Recent results using the ALMA Archive are also welcome. This four day conference will feature invited/contributed talks and poster sessions. Young researchers and students are particularly encouraged to attend the meeting.
