Dear Colleagues

The CosPA 2014 conference (Cosmology and Particle Astrophysics) will be 
held in Auckland, New Zealand from December 9-12 this year.  

CosPA brings together theorists, experimentalists and observers working in 
the fields of cosmology and particle astrophysics to discuss the latest 
data, theoretical results, and possibilities for future progress.  

CosPA is held annually in the Asia-Pacific region. This will be the 11th 
meeting in the series; conferences in the series have been held in Hawaii, 
Melbourne, Tokyo, Beijing, Pohang, Hsinchu and Taipei.  

The conference will include both plenary and parallel sessions, focussing 
on experimental and theoretical cosmology, large scale structure, particle 
astrophysics, dark matter, dark energy and theoretical and experimental 
particle physics.    

Registration and abstract submission is now open -- we hope we will see 
you in Auckland!  

Yours truly, 
Richard Easther, for the Organising Committee
