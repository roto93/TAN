Dear Prof Kuan,

Below is a announcement of the 2014 NCU Astronomy Camp. Please help to forward it to TAN.


Dear Colleagues,

We are very happy to announce that the 2014 NCU Astronomy Camp will be held at the Lulin Observatory. The Camp will take place between the 1st and the 3rd of September 2014. The goal for the Camp is to expose young people (undergraduate students) to the universe and the ways that astronomers study and uncover new secrets about it. Besides, they can get to use the research telescopes including the biggest one, LOT, in Taiwan.
Please have a look at the website for more information.
