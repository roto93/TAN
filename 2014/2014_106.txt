Dear Prof Kuan,

Please help to forward the message about 2014 NCU Astronomy Camp to TAN.


Dear Colleagues,

We are very happy to announce that the 2014 NCU Astronomy Camp will be held at
the Lulin Observatory. The Camp will take place between the 1st and the 3rd of
September 2014. The goal for the Camp is to expose young people (undergraduate
students) to the universe and the ways that astronomers study and uncover new
secrets about it. Besides, they can get to use the research telescopes
including the biggest one, LOT, in Taiwan.
Please have a look at the website for more information.
http://www.astro.ncu.edu.tw/outreach/astrocamp2014.php (中文)

The application deadline for NCU astronomy Camp 2014 is June 30.  
Please forward this information to your students if they plan to attend it.

Regards,
Zhong-Yi

Dear all,

Please find below the first announcement for the SPIRou Science Meeting as
discussed during the FDR. Rene Doyon will distribute this announcement on
Canada, and I'll do it in France. Could you distribute it in your country if
you are outside of Canada or France ?

Cheers.

Xavier



First SPIRou Science Meeting : First annoucement (Paris : 22 - 25 Sept 2014)

SPIRou recently passed its FDR (Final Design Review) and the project is now
entering the construction and integration phase (with a first light at CFHT
planned for 2017). A SPIRou Legacy Survey (SLS) of ~500 CFHT nights on a
timescale of 5 yr is proposed - to be focused on the two main science goals of
SPIRou : (i) the quest for habitable Earth-like planets around very-low-mass
stars, and (ii) the study of low-mass star & planet formation in the presence
of magnetic fields. Although dedicated to the two science goals described
above and to tightly connected topics (e.g., the activity and magnetic
topologies of M dwarfs), the SLS data will also be very useful for a variety
of other science programs of high interest for the whole community.

The observations comprising the SLS are in particular intended to achieve the
following objectives: (a) accomplish selected large-scale community-defined
scientific programs and (b) provide the community with an extensive,
homogenous, well characterized, and high quality database having the potential
for a wide range of longlasting scientific applications.

The first SPIRou Science Meeting will be held in Paris (Campus de Jussieu and
IAP) on 2014 Sept 22-25. The goal is to initiate science preparation for
SPIRou and to iterate with the community on the definition and coordination of
the SLS, to update its composition and to nominate its representatives.

The preliminary program of the SPIRou Science Meeting is as follows (a more
detailed program will be sent later on and will be available on a SPIRou
website) :

- day 1 : Definition of the SPIRou planet search; a Radial Velocity Survey of
  nearby M-dwarfs. Discussion on survey simulation, sampling, observational
strategy, target selection, constraint on planet formation, follow up
observations, activity jitter (modelisation, charcacterization, filtering),
by-product of the survey, work-package organisation...

- day 2 : Definition of the SPIRou transiting planets follow-up; target
  selection from TESS/K2/, observational strategy, Rossiter monitoring,
constraints on planetary internal structures, complementary observations with
JWST / CHEOPS, models of planet atmospheres, work-package organisation...

- day 3 : Definition of magnetic protostars survey; magnetic topologies of
  class-I, -II and -III protostars, accretion processes in low-mass
protostars, hot jupiters around wTTSs, dynamo processes of protostars and M
dwarfs, inner regions of accretion discs, work-packages organisations...

- day 4 : 1st half day : other science topics w/ SPIRou (preparation of
  complementary LP)
2nd half day : discussion on the SLS, organisation, the Data Processing
center, the DA and PP, the Work Packages, coordinators, responsibilities…

contributed presentations.
