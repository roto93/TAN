Dear Colleagues,

You are cordially invited to attend the Joint Colloquium which will be held
on February 25 (http://web.phys.ntu.edu.tw/colloquium/).

The Joint Colloquium Series is organized by the NTU Physics Department,
Center for Condensed Matter Science (CCMS), Leung Center for Cosmology and
Particle Astrophysics (LeCosPA), Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and
Astrophysics (ASIAA), and the Institute of Atomic and Molecular Sciences
(IAMS).

The idea is to have excellent speakers to give inspiring, informative, but
non-technical talks on the frontiers of Sciences.

Enclosed below is the information of the Joint Colloquium on February 25.

Best regards,

Yen-Ting Lin (ASIAA)
Michitoshi Hayashi (CCMS)
Chia-Lung Hsieh (IAMS)
Jiwoo Nam (LeCosPA)
Yuan-Huei Chang (NTU-Phys)

ASIAA/CCMS/IAMS/LeCosPA/NTU-Physics Joint Colloquium

Speaker: Luis Ho =A6=F3=A4l=A4s

               (Kavli Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics at Peking
University)

Topic :  *Black Holes Big and Small: Impact on Galaxy Formation*

Time  : 02/25 (Tue.) 14:20 - 15:20

Place : Room 104, CCMS-New Physics Building

Abstract:
    Supermassive black holes (BHs) have been found in almost 100 galaxies
by dynamical modeling of spatially resolved kinematics.  The Hubble Space
Telescope revolutionized BH research by advancing the subject from its
proof-of-concept phase into quantitative studies of BH demographics.  Most
influential was the discovery of a tight correlation between BH mass and
velocity dispersion of the bulge component of the host galaxy.  Together
with similar correlations with bulge luminosity and mass, this led to the
widespread belief that BHs and bulges coevolve by regulating each other's
growth.  I present a major update to the status of this field.  I will
discuss (1) how BH mass correlates tightly only with classical bulges and
ellipticals, (2) how the zero point and slopes of the fundamental
correlations need to be revised, (3) BH mass estimates in quasars, (4) the
discovery of intermediate-mass BHs in dwarf galaxies and implications for
quasar seeds, (5) quasar-mode energy feedback at high redshifts, and (6)
the evolution (or lack thereof) with time of the BH-host galaxy
scaling relations.

Brief Bio:
    Luis C. Ho has worked on a wide range of topics on astronomy and
astrophysics, including surveys for active galactic nuclei, physics
of quasars and active galaxies, searches for supermassive black
holes, origin of the Hubble sequence, star clusters, supernovae,
interstellar medium, and extragalactic star formation.  His research
employs multiwavelength observations on all scales, from radio waves
to X-rays, using a suite of ground-based facilities and
space-based missions.  He has published almost 500 papers, including 300
in refereed journals. Luis was educated at Harvard University and U.
C. Berkeley, and for the past 15 years he has been Staff Astronomer at the
Observatories of the Carnegie Institution for Science.  Beginning in 2014,
he has taken the positions of Director of the Kavli Institute for Astronomy
and Astrophysics (KIAA), Chair Professor in the School of Physics at Peking
University, and  Distinguished Research Fellow of the Chinese Academy of
Sciences.  He also serves as the Associate Editor of the Astrophysical
Journal Letters.

Dear All,

   There will be an ALMA/NAASC workshop in Charlottesville organised by =
NRAO. Below is the information about this workshop.
    Please register if you are interested in going.

Best,

Transformational Science in the ALMA Era: Multi-Wavelength Studies of =
Galaxy Evolution
Link: =
https://science.nrao.edu/facilities/alma/naasc-workshops/alma2014/faciliti=
es/alma/naasc-workshops/alma2014/index

Date: August 4-7, 2014

Location: Omni Hotel, Charlottesville, VA

At this workshop we will explore four central themes in the field of =
galaxy evolution by bringing together current and future studies with =
ALMA and from across the electromagnetic spectrum from existing (e.g. =
VLA/GBT/IRAM/CARMA, HST, Spitzer/Herschel, Chandra/NuStar) as well as =
future facilities (e.g., JWST, MeerKAT/ASKAP/SKA, LSST, EUCLID, =
TMT/GMT/EELT, CCAT/LMT). The four themes will be: the mass assembly =
history of galaxies and formation and evolution of galactic structure, =
the evolution of the interstellar medium and star formation over cosmic =
time, the role of large scale structure and environment and the role of =
AGN in galaxy evolution. Within these broad themes we will identify two =
to three critical questions in each area that will most benefit from the =
new data from these facilities. The participants will be invited to =
specifically address these questions. Our hope is to foster discussion =
and debate and an active exchange of ideas with the goal of energizing =
the participants to address the outstanding questions in these areas =
using multi-wavelength data from all of these facilities.=
