Title : Cosmological constraints on Unstable Dark Matter and their Implications for Galactic Substructure Properties

  Abstract:
     The nature of dark matter remains unknown. Observation on large-scale generally agrees well with the cold dark matter scenarios. However, for the past decade several issues on galactic substructure properties have been discussed, and one of the possible solutions is to change the properties of dark matter. A few popular models, including warm dark matter (WDM) and self-interacting dark matter (SIDM), have been examined in details recently. As we try to settle the controversies on small scale, the best approach is to look for complementary astrophysical constraints to isolate the viable parameter space. In our study we considered a class of unstable dark matter model in which a dark matter particle decays into a slightly less massive stable dark matter particle and a massless particle. I especially focus on late decay scenario with decay lifetime around the order of the age of the Universe.  I will show that by using contemporary SDSS Lyman-alpha forest measurement combi!
 ning with WMAP data we can place interesting and competitive limits on decaying dark matter (DDM) models. Because of its late-decay nature, this class of DDM models can have significant effects on galactic substructure at present time while agree with observations on high-redshift intergalactic medium (IGM) distribution. I will discuss the features of DDM models on various aspects of galactic-scale problems comparing to other dark matter models.  At the end I will discuss several possible ways to improve model constraints, for example by using newly-released BOSS Lyman-alpha forest data and also late-time phenomena like forthcoming weak lensing measurement. Also I will briefly discuss how we may distinguish between CDM and alternative DM models using high-quality Milky Way dwarf spheroidal (dSph) photometric and kinematic data.


Thanks,
Lance

Dear Colleagues,

You are cordially invited to attend the Joint Colloquium which will be held
on March 4 (http://web.phys.ntu.edu.tw/colloquium/).

The Joint Colloquium Series is organized by the NTU Physics Department,
Center for Condensed Matter Science (CCMS), Leung Center for Cosmology and
Particle Astrophysics (LeCosPA), Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and
Astrophysics (ASIAA), and the Institute of Atomic and Molecular Sciences
(IAMS).

The idea is to have excellent speakers to give inspiring, informative, but
non-technical talks on the frontiers of Sciences.

Enclosed below is the information of the Joint Colloquium on March 4.

Best regards,

Yen-Ting Lin (ASIAA)
Michitoshi Hayashi (CCMS)
Chia-Lung Hsieh (IAMS)
Jiwoo Nam (LeCosPA)
Yuan-Huei Chang (NTU-Phys)

ASIAA/CCMS/IAMS/LeCosPA/NTU-Physics Joint Colloquium

Speaker: Yee Bob Hsiung

Topic :  *The Elusive Neutrinos - neutrino oscillation, **mixing and mass
hierarchy*

Time  : 03/04 (Tue.) 14:20 - 15:20

Place : Room 104, CCMS-New Physics Building

Abstract:
    The tiny, nearly massless neutrinos have been one of the most elusive
particles in elementary particle physics in the past several decades. In
this talk I will review the experimental phenomena on the neutrino
oscillation, mixing and mass hierarchy, as well as the recent new results
from Daya Bay reactor neutrino experiment with spectral measurement.
    The discovery of non-zero q13 in 2012 and the unexpected large sin22q13 has
encouraged studies of the potential to resolve mass hierarchy such as the
proposed JUNO experiment. In this talk, I will describe the Daya Bay
experimental design, installation, calibration and data analysis. Together
with updates on the current results and status of Daya Bay, I will also
give a brief introduction to some potential future developments relevant to
the Daya Bay experiment.

Brief Bio:
    Prof. Yee Bob Hsiung received his Bachelor degree at NTU Physics
Department and Ph.D. in Physics at Columbia University.  He has been
working on experiments of discovering direct CP violation in neutral kaon
decays and rare K and B-meson decays, as well as LHC-CMS experiment to
search for new physics for many years, and in recent years on Daya Bay
neutrino oscillation experiment discovering 3rd mixing angle.  He was the
co-spokesperson of KTeV experiment at Fermilab before he returned to NTU in
2002. He received the Outstanding Scholar Awards from the Foundation for
the Advancement of Outstanding Scholarship (2003-2008), and was the physics
department chair (2007-2013) and the President of PSROC (2012-2014).
Recently he has received the 17th National Professorship of ROC in Taiwan
from Ministry of Education (2014-2017).

Title: Testing Cosmology with Merging Galaxy Clusters

Abstract:
Clusters of galaxies, the most massive collapsed objects
known, form from the largest positive density fluctuations
of the early Universe. Merging clusters, the most energetic
events after the big bang, provide us laboratories to test
matter in extreme conditions, which can be used, for example,
to derive the self-scattering cross section of dark matter
particles, and test cosmological models via the dynamics of
merging. After reviewing the physics of merging clusters, we
focus on how the physical parameters of clusters and their
dynamics can be derived using multi-frequency observations
and self-consistent N-body-hydrodynamical simulations.
We present our results for the infall velocities of a few merging
clusters and discuss their significance for cosmology.
