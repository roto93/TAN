Title: SPHGal: Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics with
        Improved Accuracy for Galaxy Simulations

Abstract:
We present the smoothed-particle hydrodynamics implementation SPHGal
which incorporates several recent developments into the GADGET code.
We conduct a series of idealized hydrodynamic tests. We also test
a more realistic model of an isolated disk galaxy, where we find
a feedback-induced instability developing if too much artificial
viscosity is introduced.

We find that the star formation rates vary only slightly for different SPH
schemes while the mass loading is quite sensitive to the SPH scheme.

          Tea/Discussion Time is followed !

                   All Welcome !!
