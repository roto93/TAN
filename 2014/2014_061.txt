Topic:        Using Faraday Rotation to Probe the Magnetic Field Structure of AGN Jets
Time:        4/2 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
Measurements of the distribution of Faraday rotation of the plane of polarization
occurring in the vicinities of the jets of Active GalacticNuclei (AGN) using multi-wavelength
polarization VLBI can be used to probe the magnetic (B) field structure of the jet, as well
as the B field and  and  distribution of thermal electrons in the immediate vicinity of the
radio-emitting region. Because the Faraday rotation measure (RM) depends on the
line-of-sight component of the B field in the region of Faraday rotation, it can provide a
diagnostic for the presence of toroidal or helical fields, offering an important observational
tie to theoretical models of jet launching. The crucial importance of  determining whether
reports of transverse RM gradients interpreted as evidence for helical jet B fields were reliable
led to a number of studies aimed at improving our understanding of pixel-based uncertainties in
images, sometimes leading to surprising results. My talk will discuss recent analyses of RM
measurements of AGN on parsec scales aimed at searching for evidence of helical jet B fields,
as well as Monte Carlo simulations investigating restrictions on the reliability of observed
transverse RM gradients.  These simulations have revised our ideas about the estimation of
pixel-based uncertainties in images, and also clearly show the ability to detect transverse RM
gradients when the intrinsic jet structures are much narrower than the beam size. This has 
cleared the way to both re-evaluating the significance of previously reported results, and searching 
for new reliable RM gradients across AGN jets.  The majority of previously reported transverse RM 
gradients have proved to be reliable (statistically significant), and a number of new gradients have 
been discovered in the past year. The collected results suggest that helical B fields are common 
in AGN jets, and provide evidence for the action of a cosmic battery, as initially proposed by 
Contopoulos et al. (2009).

Topic:        New insights into AGN jet and lobe physics from radio spectropolarimetry
Time:        3/31 (Monday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
New and upgraded radio telescopes, with broadband radio receivers, are enabling high-precision multi-frequency polarization and Faraday rotation measurements across a wide range of jet scales. Spectropolarimetric techniques such as Faraday rotation measure synthesis and QU-fitting have been developed to take advantage of these new capabilities, providing key insights into the magnetic field structure, particle composition and environmental impact of AGN jets and lobes. I will describe some recent results from radio spectropolarimetric studies of AGN jets and lobes, before presenting future radio telescope projects that will revolutionise our view of the polarized sky and with it our understanding of AGN jets and lobes.

Topic:        Angular resolution in astronomy: present, future and beyond
Time:        4/1 (Tuesday) 10:30 - 11:30
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
This talk will be divided into two grand themes: the development of
novel adaptive optical (AO) correction systems for the next generation
of telescopes, and the application of quantum optical mechanisms to
astronomy.

Advanced adaptive optics systems have kept ground based telescopes at
the forefront of astronomical research. However, as the telescopes
further increase in size current AO systems begin to be inadequate.
The future extremely large telescopes require new approaches, and I
will discuss some of these during my talk. I will notably argue in
favor of wavefront sensors that determine the phase directly.

The aim of adaptive optical systems is to reach the diffraction limit.
This limit is considered as the absolute boundary for the angular
resolution of a telescope; it can, however, be overcome through
non-linear processes, such as stimulated emission and quantum
entanglement.  I will examine the possibility of overcoming the
diffraction limit of a telescope through heralded photon cloning
processes (http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201322665). The main
message will be the possibility in principle to improve the angular
resolution of a telescope beyond the diffraction limit, and thus to
achieve high-angular resolutions even with moderately sized
telescopes.

Topic:        3D Mapping of the IGM on 〜Mpc scales with Ly-a forest Tomography
Time:        4/3 (Thursday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
The Lyman-alpha forest absorption at z>2 can, with a sufficient density of background sightlines, be used to create 3D tomographic maps of large-scale structure. The Cosmic Lyman-Alpha Program for the Tomographic Reconstruction of Absorption Probes (CLAPTRAP) will be the first survey to attempt this technique. We aim to obtain spectra for a background grid of faint quasars and bright LBGs at 2<z<3 at a limiting apparent magnitude of g<24. These sources are separated by transverse comoving distances of ~4 cMpc enabling a 3D absorption map with ~4-5 cMpc spatial resolution to be reconstructed. In a recent paper, we have found that spectra with S/N ~4 per angstrom are sufficient to make excellent-quality maps that clearly trace the underlying dark-matter distribution at overdensities of order unity. We aim to observe ~2500-3000 background sources over 1 sq deg of the COSMOS field with Ly-a forest coverage over 2.0<z<2.4, mapping out a total comoving volume of ~3x10^6 cMpc^3. The
  resulting tomographic maps will be the first 3D maps of large-scale structure at z>2, on ~Mpc scales. In conjunction with the rich multi-wavelength data from the COSMOS survey, these maps will facilitate the study of galaxies in the context of their large-scale environment, reveal the topology of the universe at high-redshifts, and allow the direct detection of galaxy protoclusters at the intersections of the cosmic web. In the near-future, Subaru PFS will be able to map out large areas of the high-redshift universe using this technique.
