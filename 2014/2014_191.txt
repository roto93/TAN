PATHWAYS TOWARDS HABITABLE PLANETS II

Bern (Switzerland), 13 - 17 July 2015

http://www.pathways2015.net


RATIONALE
One of the most exciting scientific challenges of this century is the
search of habitable worlds around other stars, and the characterization
of their atmospheres with the goal of detecting signs of biological
activity. This is a long-term, interdisciplinary endeavor, engaging
astrophysicists, biologists, planetary scientists, and instrument
scientists.

Pathways is dedicated to identifying the steps needed to address those
questions. Its aim is to help integrate the prospective efforts in
Europe and in the US, build a community around this theme, and bring
together several pathways towards that final goal.

The conference will be structured around key questions such as :
    â€¢    Is the habitable zone a well defined concept ?
    â€¢    Is the Sun-Earth pair a good paradigm for an inhabited system ?
    â€¢    How do we define meaningful biomarkers ?
    â€¢    What can we learn from solar system synergies ?
    â€¢    How do we build synergies between ground and space ?
    â€¢    What can we expect from approved projects ?
    â€¢    What future capacity is needed ?

Each question will be introduced by an invited speaker, or more if
several viewpoints are deemed necessary. Contributed talks and posters
will add material to the debate. Ample time will be left for discussion,
while a synthesis will be proposed on the last day.

The main session will occur in the morning and late afternoon, while the
early afternoon will be left open for poster viewing and satellite
meetings which can be proposed by the members of the community.

Pathways II follows the tracks of the Pathways Towards Habitable Planets
conference held in 2009 in Barcelona (wwww.pathways2009.net).


VENUE
The conference will be held in the main building of the University of
Bern (Hochschulstrasse 4, 3012 Bern). It is located immediately above
the central train station, with access by elevator from the platforms
level.


REGISTRATION & PAYMENT
Pre-registration to Pathways is free and open now. Independently from
the pre-registration, you can also submit a contribution for a
presentation (oral or  poster) or the organization of a satellite meeting.

Once the detailed program is finalized (on May 1st, 2015), intended
participants will be able to confirm registration and pay the
corresponding fee (tentatively set to 300chf when no financial support
is provided).

To pre-register and/or submit a contribution, you need to create an
account with Sciencesconf.org, if you do not have one already. This can
be done in the "MY SPACE" section from the menu bar on the left, or
following this link.


SUPPORT
A limited amount of financial support will be available for students,
very junior scientists and participants from emerging countries
contributing with a talk or a poster. The support will concern local
expenses and registration fees, but not the plane or train ticket.
Details can be found on the conference website.
