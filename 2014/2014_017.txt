Arizona Radio Observatory: Call for Proposals (Spring 2014)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Astronomers in Taiwan,

Observing proposals from members of the University Consortium of ALMA-Taiwan
(UCAT) and ASIAA for the 10-meter Sub-Millimeter Telescope (SMT), located on
Mount Graham, Arizona, of the Arizona Radio Observatory (ARO) are being
solicited for the period 01 February 2014 to 30 June 2014. The proposal
deadline of UCAT/ASIAA for this 2014 spring semester is set on February 07,
2014 (Friday).

The SMT currently supports a dual-polarization, 1-mm receiver (215-280 GHz)
with ALMA Band 6 sideband-separating (SBS) mixers, a dual-polarization 0.8-mm
(320-370 GHz) receiver, and a 0.4-mm (602-720 GHz) dual-polarization receiver
with ALMA Band 9 mixers. A new 0.6-mm (420-500 GHz) dual-polarization receiver
incorporating sideband-separating mixers will be available as well. The SMT
control system supports both dual-polarization ("2 IF mode"), and
dual-polarization, dual sideband observations ("4 IF mode"), as well as OTF
mapping.

Remote observing is available at http://aro.as.arizona.edu/remote/remote.htm.
Graduate-student participation is especially encouraged. For further information
about remote observing and other operational questions, contact Tom Folkers,
Operations Manager tfolkers@email.arizona.edu.

Proposers should consult the ARO website (http://aro.as.arizona.edu/) for
technical specifications and to download updated proposal templates. Proposers
are required to list on the cover sheet their requested observing blocks (LST
ranges), dates on which they are not available to observe, and dates in which
sources in those observing blocks are within the Sun-avoidance zone (44 degrees
at the SMT).

Proposals should consist of:
1.  A proposal Cover Sheet, obtainable at http://aro.as.arizona.edu/proposals.
2.  A brief scientific and technical justification (no more than 2 pages).
3.  A source list with observing time requirements and justification, and/or
    tables, figures and references (no more than 1 page in total).
4.  Observers that plan to observe remotely must supply fixed IP address(es) of
    the computer(s) that will be used during observing on the cover sheet of the
    proposal.

Electronic submissions will be accepted in PDF format ONLY. Scheduling of
successful proposals will be done according to availability of the receivers
requested. The final proposal pdf file should be emailed to kuan@asiaa.sinica.ed
u.tw
by midnight (23:59 pm CST) February 07, 2014 (Friday).


Kind regards,
Yi-Jehng Kuan
on behalf of UCAT's ARO TAC

Dear colleagues,

  This is an announcement of the regular seminar of High Energy Theory Group 
at AS.

Speaker: Prof. Francois Bouchet [Institut d'astrophysique de Paris]

    Title: Highlights of the latest cosmological results from Planck

    Time: 11:00 - 12:00

    Date: 24 Jan. 2014

  Place: P7F, Institute of Physics (IoP), Academia Sinica (AS)

Abstract:
  Sketched out in 1992, selected by ESA in 1996, launched in 2009, Planck 
delivered on
March 21st 2013 its first full sky maps of the millimetric emission at 9 
frequencies, as
well as those which follow from them, and in particular Planck map of the 
anisotropies
of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). The later displays minuscule 
variations as a
function of the observing direction of the temperature of the fossile 
radiation around
its mean temperature of 2.725K. I will briefly describe how these high 
resolution maps
with a precision of a few parts in a million have been obtained, from 
collection to
analysis of the first 500 billion samples of our HFI instrument. CMB 
anisotropies reveal
the imprint of the primordial fluctuations which initiate the growth of the 
large scale
structures of the Universe, as transformed by their evolution, in particular 
during the
first 370 000 years, i.e. till the Universe became transparent and the forming 
of the
image we record today. The statistical characteristics of these anisotropies 
allow
constraining jointly the physics of the creation of the primordial 
fluctuations and that
of their evolution. They teach us the possible value of the parameters of the 
models
which we confront to data. I will describe Planck estimates of the density of 
the
constituents of the Universe (usual matter, cold dark matter or CDM, dark 
energy...),
and their implication in terms of derived quantities like the expansion rate 
or the
spatial curvature. I will review what we learnt on the generation of the 
fluctuation,
and will discuss extensions of the standard cosmological model, so called 
"Lambda-CDM",
both in term of non minimal physical models -- multi-field inflation for 
instance, or
additional constituents - like cosmic strings or a fourth neutrino. Finally, 
it intend
to briefly describe other promising results on the matter distribution which 
is
travelled through by the CMB image on its long 13.7 billion years trip towards 
us. I
will mention in particular what we can learn on the dark matter distribution - 
which is
detected through its distorting effect of the CMB image by gravitational 
lensing, or
that of hot gaz, which is revealed by the spectral distortion it induces.

Dear Taiwan Astrophysics Colleagues,

Happy New Year of the Horse.

A colleague requested to have a message broadcast to the related physics communities in Taiwan.

Please refer to the attached message, on a call of application to visit the Aspen Center in summer 2014. The sender is a professor of physics in UCLA, in her capacity as Diversity Committee chair at ACP.

As you can see, the context is: the person responsible to promote and provide support to a diversified user-community at Aspen is requesting applications seven days prior to the deadline. And Aspen does not strong component of astro-flavored programs.

Feel free to forward the information to other interested physics colleagues in Taiwan.

Best Regards,
Henry Wong 王子敬

> Subject: help to get more physicists from Taiwan to apply to Aspen Center for Physics workshops- financial help now available

Dear Prof Wong, first of all very happy new year for you and your loved ones!

I am writing to you now because I am involved with the Aspen Center for Physics, in Aspen, Colorado, USA (I am the chair of the ``Diversity" committee this year, in particular) and I would like to make sure that we get more applicants to the summer workshops from people from countries from which we get very few
participants, and Taiwan is one of them.

The Center is an excellent place to get in contact and start collaborations with other physicists, mostly because of all the unstructured time for informal contacts it provides. However, coming to the Aspen Center is costly and this discourages many people to apply. But now there is a good opportunity. There is a foundation, the Simons Foundation, which has given 100 k dollars per year for 5 years to the Aspen Center for Physics to finance the visit of participants to the workshops from underrepresented countries (this is the second year of the grant). The condition is that the money available for science in the country is below a certain range, and Taiwan does qualify. I wonder if you could forward the message to people in Taiwan who you think maybe interested, or maybe post it somewhere. In fact, if you have any suggestion of other people or websites in Taiwan I could contact for this purpose, please let me know. The minimum stay for theorists is two weeks and for experime!
ntalists is one week.

The information about the summer workshops is at

http://www.aspenphys.org/physicists/summer/index.html

The information about the grant in ACP the website is:

``The Simons Foundation has generously provided funds to support physicists coming from countries where science funding is not strong or from economically disadvantaged countries. All physicists who would like to participate at the Aspen Center for Physics apply before January 31 of the year preceding the summer they would like to attend. The admissions process is rigorous due to the large number of applications. This results in a 60\% acceptance rate. Physicists do not apply for the Simons grant. If the country in which they are working is one that will be supported that year, the physicists will receive letters of acceptance that include information about Simons funding. The Simons grant pays for an accepted individual's registration fee, shared housing while in Aspen (one's own room in a two- or three-bedroom apartment), and a portion of air travel, which will vary from year to year, but will not cover all of one's travel
expenses. "

The houses in Aspen are gorgeous so the accommodation in a house is very good. Each room has a separate bathroom, the kitchens are large and fully equipped, and the Aspen Center lends bicycles or people can take the public free transportation the City of Aspen provides across town to go around (the city is small).

The application deadline is January 31st and it only takes a moment:

http://www.aspenphys.org/physicists/summer/program/applications.html

The Aspen Center not only accepts people for workshops but also by individual research groups of a few people, and even isolated researchers. But applying to a workshop is the most common way to apply. We would like your help to encourage people from Taiwan to apply (it is not sure that they will get in, the
acceptance is on scientific grounds exclusively, but applying is the first step).

Thanks for your help. This is somewhat urgent now because we have only one week before the deadline.

Best regards, Graciela

Session Title: Studies of Small Bodies in the Solar System and Insights into Planetary System Formation

Session Description

The Small Bodies and Planetary System Formation Session will address
the latest studies of primitive bodies in the solar system. Asteroids,
comets, small satellites, trans-Neptunian objects, meteors, and
interplanetary dust particles are remnants of the early solar
system. These objects give us clues to the formation of planetary
systems. Scientific investigations include, but are not limited to,
physical characterization, understanding of the origin and the
evolution of the solar system, and the formation processes and
configuration of other planetary systems.

Recently, synergies between in-situ measurements by spacecraft,
laboratory experiments and analysis, ground and space-based
observational studies, together with theoretical and numerical studes
are leading to significant progress. These studies inform research
into the formation of planetary systems.

Preliminary List of Invited Speakers
Franck Marchis    "High resolution imagings of asteroid's surfaces"
Thomas Mueller    "Contributions by Herschel on TNOs"
Humberto Campins  "Water on asteroids and meteorites"
