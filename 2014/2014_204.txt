Topic:         Compact Quiescent Galaxies at Intermediate Redshifts
Time:         12/29 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
In the local universe, the most massive galaxies are mostly giant ellipticals that show little or no recent star formation. However, many studies have found that massive quiescent galaxies at z > 2 are generally very compact, with effective radii R_e < 2 kpc. Proposed mechanisms to create such compact galaxies from star-forming progenitors generally involve violent, dynamical processes such as gas-rich mergers or dynamical instabilities fed by cold streams. Also, it is now believed that the high-redshift compact galaxies become the cores of the most massive local galaxies after accreting envelopes through minor mergers over cosmic time.

However, it is very difficult to study the compact quiescent galaxies at z > 2 in detail because they are faint. Therefore, many recent studies have focused on identifying and characterizing some similar objects at lower redshifts, where images and spectra with high quality are accessible. In this talk, I will present our recent work on 22 compact quiescent galaxies identified between z ~ 0.4 and z ~ 0.9 from several searches of the area common to SDSS and the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope (UKIRT) Infrared Deep Sky Survey (UKIDSS). I will discuss the formation mechanisms of these galaxies based on our studies of their morphologies and stellar populations.
