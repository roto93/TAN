>> Taiwan, Japan, and Princeton) about scientific opportunities from
>> the first-year data. Note that this workshop is a closed meeting,
>> only for the HSC collaborators from Taiwan, Japan, and Princeton.
>> 
>> We will focus on doing science and writing papers based on the
>> first-year data of the HSC-SSP survey. Specifically we will focus
>> on the following topics:
>>  -- Current status of the HSC hardware
>>  -- HSC reduction pipeline, database, and the internal data release
>>  -- Outcomes of the S14A and S14B runs
>>  -- Quasar selection methods
>>  -- AGN photometric redshifts
>>  -- Statistics of quasars and SMBHs from the HSC data
>>  -- Co-evolution studies of SMBHs and galaxies with the HSC data
>>  -- Synergies of HSC and multi-wavelength data for SMBH studies
>>  -- Strategies for spectroscopic follow-up and the relation with PFS
>>  -- Theoretical preparations for HSC quasar surveys
>>  -- Discussion for publications and the S15A runs
>>  -- Action items for the HSC-SSP 2nd year and beyond that
>> 
>> The meeting will take place at Academia Sinica, Institute of Astronomy
>> and Astrophysics (ASIAA). The institute is located in the city of
>> Taipei, the capital of Taiwan, on the grounds of National Taiwan

NTHU astronomy colloquium - Friday, November 7 2014, 14:00-15:00, R620

Speaker: Gregg Hallinan (Caltech)
Title: Space Weather Beyond Our Solar System

Abstract:
Magnetic activity has played a key role in the formation and angular
momentum evolution of our Sun and continues to power its radio and high
energy output. The associated radiative output and magnetized plasma
outflow (solar wind) dominates the local space environment of solar system
planets, including Earth, particularly during flares and CMEs. Radio
observations are a powerful trace of these phenomena, both through the
radio bursts produced during flares and CMEs and the low frequency auroral
radio emission produced by magnetized planets experiencing magnetic storms,
the latter a key diagnostic for the presence and strength of planetary
magnetic fields. I will talk about new experiments at Caltech's Owens
Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO), dedicated to the detection of such space
weather on nearby stellar and planetary systems. These includes the
Starburst program, dedicated to the detection and imaging of coronal mass
ejections on nearby stars, and the Owens Valley Long Wavelength Array,
which aims to detect the auroral radio emissions from nearby exoplanets.
The latter is particularly innovative, consisting of 288 antennas, combined
to image the entire viewable sky every second from 25-85 MHz. This facility
recently saw first light and is currently aiming to provide the first
measurement of magnetic fields on extrasolar planets. Finally, I will also
discuss the recent detection of similar aurorae, both optical and radio,
from brown dwarfs, which has allowed us to place the strongest constraints
yet achieved on dynamo theory in the substellar regime.

Topic:         Dual Molecular Outflows from the Most Luminous Galaxy in the Local Universe
Time:         11/3 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
Luminous galaxies have their luminosity from large population of young and massive stars and/or 
accreting massive black holes at the nuclei. The high luminosity often results in a large-scale outflow 
of interstellar medium from around the luminosity source. Cold molecular gas is the most important 
outflow medium in this negative feedback to the luminosity generation because it is the fuel for star 
formation and can be the material feeding the central massive black hole.  In this lunch talk 
I will present our ALMA observations of molecular outflow from the most luminous galaxy
within z=0.01, NGC 3256. We found dual bipolar molecular outflows with distinctive properties from 
the two merger nuclei. One of them is particularly noteworthy in that it is a well-collimated bipolar
molecular jet having a ~kpc extent and apparent acceleration; its velocity peaks at ~ 2000 km/s at
300 pc from the driving nucleus. Both outflows eject tens of solar masses per year from the nuclei. 
They are as important as star formation in the gas consumption of the system.

Topic:         Space Weather Beyond Our Solar System
Time:         11/5 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20

Speaker:    Jason Rhodes (JPL)
Topic:         WFIRST and Euclid
Time:         11/6 (Thursday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
Dark energy, the name given to the cause of the accelerating expansion
of the Universe, is one of the most profound mysteries in modern science.
Current cosmological models hold that dark energy is currently the dominant
component of the Universe, but the exact nature of dark energy
remains poorly understood. There are ambitious ground-based surveys
underway that seek to understand dark energy and NASA is participating
in the development of significantly more ambitious space-based surveys
planned for the next decade. NASA is providing mission-enabling
technology to the European Space Agency‘s (ESA) Euclid mission in exchange
for US scientists to participate in the Euclid mission. NASA is
also developing the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope-Astrophysics
Focused Telescope Asset (WFIRST-AFTA) mission for possible launch
in ˜2023. WFIRST was the highest ranked space mission in the Astro2010
Decadal Survey and the AFTA incarnation of the WFIRST design
uses a 2.4m space telescope to go beyond what the Decadal Survey
envisioned for WFIRST. Understanding dark energy is one of the primary
science goals of WFIRST-AFTA. I’ll discuss the status of Euclid
and WFIRST and comment on the complementarity of the two missions. I’ll also briefly discuss other, exciting science goals for WFIRST, including a search for exoplanets using both microlensing and a dedicated coronagraph.

Topic:         Measuring Dark Energy to 1% Accuracy Using Cosmological Simulations
Time:         11/7 (Friday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
The nature of Dark Energy, thought to be driving the accelerating
expansion of the Universe, is one of the most compelling mysteries in
all of science. Determining the equation-of-state of Dark Energy to 1%
accuracy is currently a leading goal for many planned cosmological
surveys, such as NASA's Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST),
ESA's Euclid and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). Numerical
simulations of structure formation are required to make predictions for
these surveys and to help mitigate systematics. My SUNGLASS pipeline
(Simulated UNiverses for Gravitational Lensing Analysis and Shear
Surveys) is able to produce Monte Carlo suites of numerical simulations
and rapidly generates mock weak lensing galaxy shear catalogues. These
catalogues are being used to investigate astrophysical systematics, to
generate accurate covariance matrices that account for the non-linear
nature of the Universe and as an integral part of end-to-end simulation
pipelines - each element being essential to the measurement of the Dark
Energy equation-of-state to 1% in future telescope missions. In this
talk, I will discuss SUNGLASS and its vital role in Dark Energy
telescope mission development and analysis.
