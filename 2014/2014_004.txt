Faculty Position in Earth Sciences at National Taiwan Normal University

The Department of Earth Sciences at National Taiwan Normal University invites
applications for one faculty position in Astronomy, Atmospheric Science,
Geology, Geophysics, or Oceanography starting in the August of 2014. The
position is expected to be at the Assistant Professor level, but a higher
level appointment may be considered for exceptionally qualified candidates.

Candidates in all the above-mentioned disciplines will be considered. However,
candidates for the Astronomy discipline will be considered in the field of
radio and infrared astronomy (with ample experience in interferometry),
astrobiology, minor Solar-System bodies, planetary science, and in comparative
planetology. Candidates for the Geology discipline will be considered in the
field of metamorphic petrology with expertise using analytical (i.e. ICP-MS or
electron microprobe) and modeling techniques. For the Geophysics discipline,
applicants with research interests across the full range of disciplines of
theoretical and applied geophysics are invited. However, preference will be
given to candidates specializing in inverse theory, earthquake engineering, and
field methods.

The appointees should have a demonstrated record in research and a commitment
to excellence in undergraduate and graduate teaching. It is expected that the
candidate will have a Ph.D. in Astronomy, Atmospheric Science, Geology,
Geophysics, or Oceanography at the time of the appointment with preference
given to those with post-doctoral experience and whose interests, abilities,
and experience benefit our existing programs.

Applicants should submit a cover letter, a current CV, a publication list, a
description of how your future research and teaching will contribute to the
overall goals of the department, a (photo) copy of doctorate diploma, and
arrange three letters of reference directly sent to:
    Dr. Horng-sheng Mii, Chair of the Department of Earth Sciences,
    National Taiwan Normal University,
    No. 88, Sec. 4, Ting-Chou Road, Taipei 11677,
    Taiwan, R.O.C.

Complete applications should be received by Feb. 17, 2014 for full
consideration.

Inquiries can be directed to Ms. Grace Lin (grand@ntnu.edu.tw,
esadmin@deps.ntnu.edu.tw), Telephone: +886-2-7734-6375, Fax: +886-2-2933-3315.

Dear Colleagues,

You are cordially invited to attend the Joint Colloquium which will be held
on December 31 (http://web.phys.ntu.edu.tw/colloquium/), the last one of
this semester.

The Joint Colloquium Series is organized by the NTU Physics Department,
Center for Condensed Matter Science (CCMS), Leung Center for Cosmology and
Particle Astrophysics (LeCosPA), Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and
Astrophysics (ASIAA), and the Institute of Atomic and Molecular Sciences
(IAMS).

The idea is to have excellent speakers to give inspiring, informative, but
non-technical talks on the frontiers of Sciences.

Enclosed below is the information of the Joint Colloquium on December 31.

Best regards,

Yen-Ting Lin (ASIAA)
Michitoshi Hayashi (CCMS)
Chia-Lung Hsieh (IAMS)
Jiwoo Nam (LeCosPA)
Juinn-Wei Chen (NTU-Phys)

ASIAA/CCMS/IAMS/LeCosPA/NTU-Physics Joint Colloquium

Speaker: Jhih-Wei Chu

              (National Chiao Tung University)

Topic :  *Special Seminar for 2013 Nobel Chemistry Prize: The Past,
Current, and Future of Multiscale **Simulation*

Time  : 12/31 (Tue.) 14:20 - 15:20

Place : Room 104, CCMS-New Physics Building

Abstract:
    In this talk, I will present the history and my perspectives of the
Nobel chemistry prize announced earlier this year. The background for the
development of multiscale simulation methods, the ideas and implementation
being formed, and the impact of these researches will be addressed. The
context for the discussion of which will include some of my research
endeavors. I will also remark on the current status and future perspectives
of multiscale simulation in chemistry, physics, and biology from my point
of view.

Brief Bio:
    Professor Jhih-Wei Chu is a world leading expert in using computers to
simulate biosystems. He is interested in understanding how a complex system
acquires functionalities from its building blocks and their structures and
dynamics. In the meantime, he also develops multiscale computational
schemes to make such simulations possible.
    Prof. Chu got his BS degree from the Chemical Engineering department of
NTU, Ph. D from MIT and after a postdoc term at Utah, he joined the faculty
Berkeley in 2006. He came back to Taiwan from Berkeley this year. Now he is
professor of Biological Science and Technology at National Chiao Tung
University.
    He has received several prestigious awards, including the International
Outstanding Junior Scholars, Foundation for the Advancement of Outstanding
Scholarship in 2013; Chancellor's Faculty Partnership Award, UC Berkeley in
2009; and the Hewlett-Packard Outstanding Junior Faculty Award in 2007.
