*** Colloquium
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Phil Armitage (Univ. of Colorado)
Topic:        Simulating and observing turbulence in protoplanetary disks
Time:        5/21 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
The strength and nature of turbulence in astrophysical disks is one of the main uncertainties in both accretion disk theory and planet formation. I will present numerical simulations of protoplanetary disk turbulence, which include the non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic effects that damp turbulence in cool poorly-ionized disks. The results hint at a critical role for large-scale magnetic fields, which may be remnants of the star formation process. Sub-mm observations with the SMA and ALMA now approach the acuity needed to measure the turbulent broadening of molecular lines in protoplanetary disks, and I will show predictions for what we may expect to see.

Speaker:    Debra Fischer (Yale University)
Topic:        The Search For 100 Earths
Time:        5/22 (Thursday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
The search for planets orbiting nearby stars has been one of
the greatest success stories of the past decade, with hundreds of
discoveries being made using Doppler, transit, microlensing, and
direct imaging techniques and thousands of candidates detected with
NASAâ€™s Kepler mission. Exoplanet detections have launched a subfield
of astronomy that includes host star characterizations, measurements
of planet radii and density, studies of atmospheres, interior
structure, formation theory, and orbital evolution.

The search for exoplanets is motivated by the question of whether life
exists elsewhere. This drives our interest in the detection of planets
that are similar to our own world: rocky planets with the potential
for liquid surface water and plate tectonics; worlds that might harbor
life that we can recognize. Importantly, we will need to discover not
just a few, but hundreds of these worlds to eventually gain a
statistical understanding of whether life is rare, common, or
ubiquitous and ground-based telescopes offer an ideal platform for
carrying out decade-long surveys. It is critical for follow-up studies
(imaging, atmospheric studies) that these planets orbit nearby stars.
In this talk, I will discuss how we plan to take what we've learned
and push on to the next frontier: our plans for a next generation
spectrograph, EXPRES, to carry out a search 100 Earths with the
Discovery Channel Telescope.
