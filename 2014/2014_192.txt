Speaker:    Meg Schwamb (ASIAA)
Topic:         Probing the Inner Edge of the Inner Oort Cloud
Time:         12/1 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
The discovery of Sedna, nearly a decade ago, on a highly eccentric orbit beyond the Kuiper belt challenged our understanding of the Solar System. With a perihelion of 76 AU, Sedna is well beyond the reach of the gas-giants and could not be scattered onto its highly eccentric orbit from interactions with Neptune alone. Sednaâ€™s aphelion at ~1000 AU is too far from the edge of the Solar System to feel the perturbing effects of passing stars or galactic tides in the present-day solar neighborhood. Some other mechanism no longer active in the Solar System today is required to emplace Sedna on its orbit. Sedna's origin remains an outstanding question in planetary astronomy.

Sedna's presence predicts a population of icy bodies on similar orbits residing past the Kuiper belt detached from the Solar System in what has been called the Inner Oort Cloud. The recent discovery of 2012 VP113 confirms the presence of the Inner Oort Cloud. The orbits of these distant planetoids are dynamically frozen in place providing a fossilized record of their formation. Using dynamical modeling we probe the location of the inner edge of the Inner Oort cloud and its implications for future observational constraints including finding additional Sedna-like bodies. In particular, I will present results constraining the inner edge of the Inner Oort cloud, produced in the proposed formation scenario where stellar encounters early on in an embedded cluster phase of the Solar System, created Sedna-like orbits.


*** ASIAA/NTU Joint Colloquium ***

Speaker:    Doug Lin (UC Santa Cruz)
Topic:         Ubiquity of planets and diversity of planetary systems: Origin and Destiny of multiple super Earths and gas giants.
Time:         12/2 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         physics 104
Abstract:
Planetary astrophysics is the most rapidly advancing
field in the astronomical community today.  Planetary
census suggest they are common and their mass-
period distribution is a function of the mass and metallicity
of their host stars. The diverse and intriguing kinematic
properties of multiple planetary systems are likely to
be the direct consequence of both the boundary condition
of their natal disks and the long-term evolution of nonlinear
dynamical systems.  I will show how the emergence of super-Earth is a
robust process whereas the formation of gas giant planets is a
threshold phenomena. The topics to be discussed include physical
barriers in the planet building process, the role of migration in
their evolving natal disks, planets' interaction with each other and
with their host stars.
I will also discuss some key observations which may provide
quantitative tests for planet formation theories and new clues on the
dynamical evolution and internal structure of planets.

Speaker:    Kate Su (University of Arizona)
Topic:         What Debris Disks Tell Us About Terrestrial Planet Formation
Time:         12/3 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
The critical stages of terrestrial planet formation have until now only been amenable to study in the realm of computer simulations. The newly discovered variable emission from extreme debris disks provides a unique opportunity to learn about asteroid-sized bodies in young exoplanetary systems and to explore planetesimal collisions and their aftermaths during the era of terrestrial-planet-building, putting the study of terrestrial planet formation on a better observational footing. I will highlight recent results from time-series monitoring of a 35 Myr-old disk around ID8 in NGC 2547, and discuss future directions for the study of the detailed process of large impacts in the era of terrestrial planet formation using space facilities.

Dear colleagues,

Below I am forwarding an announcement of a conference
PATHWAYS TOWARDS HABITABLE PLANETS II.

Regards,
Hiro

********* First call for papers and pre-registration open *********

PATHWAYS TOWARDS HABITABLE PLANETS II

Bern (Switzerland), 13 - 17 July 2015

http://www.pathways2015.net


RATIONALE
One of the most exciting scientific challenges of this century is the
search of habitable worlds around other stars, and the characterization
of their atmospheres with the goal of detecting signs of biological
activity. This is a long-term, interdisciplinary endeavor, engaging
astrophysicists, biologists, planetary scientists, and instrument
scientists.

Pathways is dedicated to identifying the steps needed to address those
questions. Its aim is to help integrate the prospective efforts in
Europe and in the US, build a community around this theme, and bring
together several pathways towards that final goal.

The conference will be structured around key questions such as :
    â€¢    Is the habitable zone a well defined concept ?
    â€¢    Is the Sun-Earth pair a good paradigm for an inhabited system ?
    â€¢    How do we define meaningful biomarkers ?
    â€¢    What can we learn from solar system synergies ?
    â€¢    How do we build synergies between ground and space ?
    â€¢    What can we expect from approved projects ?
    â€¢    What future capacity is needed ?

Each question will be introduced by an invited speaker, or more if
several viewpoints are deemed necessary. Contributed talks and posters
will add material to the debate. Ample time will be left for discussion,
while a synthesis will be proposed on the last day.

The main session will occur in the morning and late afternoon, while the
early afternoon will be left open for poster viewing and satellite
meetings which can be proposed by the members of the community.

Pathways II follows the tracks of the Pathways Towards Habitable Planets
conference held in 2009 in Barcelona (wwww.pathways2009.net).


VENUE
The conference will be held in the main building of the University of
Bern (Hochschulstrasse 4, 3012 Bern). It is located immediately above
the central train station, with access by elevator from the platforms
level.


REGISTRATION & PAYMENT
Pre-registration to Pathways is free and open now. Independently from
the pre-registration, you can also submit a contribution for a
presentation (oral or  poster) or the organization of a satellite meeting.

Once the detailed program is finalized (on May 1st, 2015), intended
participants will be able to confirm registration and pay the
corresponding fee (tentatively set to 300chf when no financial support
is provided).

To pre-register and/or submit a contribution, you need to create an
account with Sciencesconf.org, if you do not have one already. This can
be done in the "MY SPACE" section from the menu bar on the left, or
following this link.


SUPPORT
A limited amount of financial support will be available for students,
very junior scientists and participants from emerging countries
contributing with a talk or a poster. The support will concern local
expenses and registration fees, but not the plane or train ticket.
Details can be found on the conference website.
