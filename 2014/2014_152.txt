Speaker:    James Chan (NTU/ASIAA)
Topic:         CHITAH: Strong-Gravitational-Lens Hunter in Imaging Surveys
Time:         10/13 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:         R1203


*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Albert Kong (NTHU)
Topic:         Spider-man vs Transformers: Hunting for the missing black widows
Time:         10/15 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
Six years of observations with the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope
have revolutionized our knowledge of the gamma-ray pulsar population,
leading to the discovery of over 40 millisecond pulsars (MSPs) by
combining with deep radio observations. With this growing number of
gamma-ray emitting MSPs and by combining multi-wavelength observing
facilities, it is now possible to study their properties as a
population. In this talk, I will review recent discoveries of
"transformer" MSPs that switch between low-mass X-ray binaries and
radio MSPs. I will also discuss how multi-wavelength observations
reveal a new population of black widow/redback MSPs that provide new
insights into MSP's emission mechanisms.



*** Special Seminar ***
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Bi-Qing For (Univ. of Western Australia)
Topic:         The gaseous features of the Magellanic System
Time:         10/14 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
In this talk, I will present the results of a study of high velocity clouds in the Magellanic Stream and the Leading Arm. The study uses the Galactic All-Sky Survey (GASS) and a newly conducted survey data of the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). The properties of HVCs in the two regions are compared and contrasted in order to study the different mechanisms shaping their structure and evolution. I will also present new discoveries from the study and report ongoing/future surveys on the Magellanic Clouds with state-of-the-art telescopes.
