Dear Colleagues,

You are cordially invited to attend the Joint Colloquium which will be held
on March 18 (http://web.phys.ntu.edu.tw/colloquium/ updating).

The Joint Colloquium Series is organized by the NTU Physics Department,
Center for Condensed Matter Science (CCMS), Leung Center for Cosmology and
Particle Astrophysics (LeCosPA), Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and
Astrophysics (ASIAA), and the Institute of Atomic and Molecular Sciences
(IAMS).

The idea is to have excellent speakers to give inspiring, informative, but
non-technical talks on the frontiers of Sciences.

Enclosed below is the information of the Joint Colloquium on March 18.

Best regards,

Yen-Ting Lin (ASIAA)
Michitoshi Hayashi (CCMS)
Chia-Lung Hsieh (IAMS)
Jiwoo Nam (LeCosPA)
Yuan-Huei Chang (NTU-Phys)

ASIAA/CCMS/IAMS/LeCosPA/NTU-Physics Joint Colloquium

Speaker: Phil Marshall

               (Stanford University)

Topic :  *Measuring Distance in the Universe with Gravitational Lenses*

Time  : 03/18 (Tue.) 14:20 - 15:20

Place : Room 104, CCMS-New Physics Building

Abstract:
    Understanding the mysterious "Dark Energy" that appears to be driving
the expansion of the Universe is one of the biggest challenges facing
cosmologists today. While offering no new physical understanding, I will
describe a method for at least quantifying the effect of the dark energy
that is both new and old: the time delays between the multiple images of
gravitationally lensed AGN have long been known to enable a measurement
of the Hubble constant, but we have only recently shown how, with
careful modeling of enough high quality data, we can achieve comparable
accuracy to other, better known cosmographic probes. After introducing
and describing this experiment in some detail, I will discuss how we
plan to build on it in the next decade, using new lenses discovered
using the Large Synoptic Survey Telescopes to find and measure
large numbers of suitable systems.

Bio:
    Phil Marshall is a research scientist at SLAC national accelerator
laboratory. He did his PhD at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge,
UK, on Bayesian inference and clusters of galaxies. He was one of the
founding postdocs at the Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and
Cosmology at Stanford, where he began thinking about strong
gravitational lenses, their applications in galaxy evolution and
cosmology, and how to find more of them in wide field imaging surveys.
He has been chair of the LSST strong lensing science collaboration
since 2006, during which time he has been TABASGO Fellow at the
University of California, Santa Barbara, Kavli Fellow at KIPAC, and
Royal Society university research fellow at Oxford. Phil is now
working on developing science analyses for LSST, among many other
things.
