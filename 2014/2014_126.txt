*** Colloquium
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Masamune Oguri (University of Tokyo/Kavli IPMU)
Topic:        Gravitationally lensed supernovae
Time:        8/20 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
Gravitationally lensed supernovae are rare but
very interesting phenomena. I'll discuss why gravitationally
lensed supernovae are unique and useful, and then show that
the unusual supernova PS1-10afx found in Pan-STARRS1 was
in fact a normal type Ia supernova magnified 30 times by a
foreground galaxy, representing the first discovery of
strongly lensed supernovae.

Topic:        Origin of Cosmic Magnetism: Primordial or Astrophysical?
Time:        8/22 (Friday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
In usual astrophysical circumstances, magnetic diffusivity is very low and, as a result, magnetic fields lines are tied to fluid elements. Therefore random turbulence motions can efficiently stretch magnetic
field lines, which results in amplification of magnetic field. This turbulence dynamo is believed to play important roles in the origin of cosmic magnetism. For turbulence dynamo, a weak seed magnetic field is required. If the seed field has cosmological origin, it could be regarded as uniform (or homogeneous) at the scale of galaxy clusters. On the other hand, if the seed field is ejected from astrophysical bodies, it could be highly localized in space at the beginning. In this talk I'll discuss growth of uniform and localized seed magnetic fields in turbulence. I will demonstrate that growth of both uniform and localized seed magnetic fields in clusters of galaxies is very similar. Therefore, it is difficult to tell whether or not the seed magnetic field has cosmological or astrophysical origin in clusters of galaxies. However, I'll show that it is possible to tell the difference between them in filaments.
