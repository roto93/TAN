*** Colloquium

Speaker:    James Lattimer (Stony Brook University)
Topic:        Constraining the Nuclear Equation of State with Neutron Stars
Time:        2/7 (Friday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
There are now about 30 precise neutron star mass measurements.  Astronomical observations of X-ray bursts and thermal
emissions from neutron stars have recently allowed estimates of their radii.  These measurements can be used to constrain the equation of state of the neutron-rich dense matter found in these stars.  At the same time, several nuclear experiments, and theories of pure neutron matter, are able to probe the properties of neutron-rich matter.  A remarkable concordance of experiment, theory and observations regarding dense matter and neutron stars is emergng.
