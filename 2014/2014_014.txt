Dear colleagues,

  This is an announcement of the regular seminar of High Energy Theory Group 
at AS. 
---------------------------------------
Speaker: Prof. Francois Bouchet [Institut d'astrophysique de Paris]

    Title: Highlights of the latest cosmological results from Planck

    Time: 11:00 - 12:00

    Date: 24 Jan. 2014

  Place: P7F, Institute of Physics (IoP), Academia Sinica (AS)

Abstract:
  Sketched out in 1992, selected by ESA in 1996, launched in 2009, Planck 
delivered on
March 21st 2013 its first full sky maps of the millimetric emission at 9 
frequencies, as
well as those which follow from them, and in particular Planck map of the 
anisotropies
of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). The later displays minuscule 
variations as a
function of the observing direction of the temperature of the fossile 
radiation around
its mean temperature of 2.725K. I will briefly describe how these high 
resolution maps
with a precision of a few parts in a million have been obtained, from 
collection to
analysis of the first 500 billion samples of our HFI instrument. CMB 
anisotropies reveal
the imprint of the primordial fluctuations which initiate the growth of the 
large scale
structures of the Universe, as transformed by their evolution, in particular 
during the
first 370 000 years, i.e. till the Universe became transparent and the forming 
of the
image we record today. The statistical characteristics of these anisotropies 
allow
constraining jointly the physics of the creation of the primordial 
fluctuations and that
of their evolution. They teach us the possible value of the parameters of the 
models
which we confront to data. I will describe Planck estimates of the density of 
the
constituents of the Universe (usual matter, cold dark matter or CDM, dark 
energy...),
and their implication in terms of derived quantities like the expansion rate 
or the
spatial curvature. I will review what we learnt on the generation of the 
fluctuation,
and will discuss extensions of the standard cosmological model, so called 
"Lambda-CDM",
both in term of non minimal physical models -- multi-field inflation for 
instance, or
additional constituents - like cosmic strings or a fourth neutrino. Finally, 
it intend
to briefly describe other promising results on the matter distribution which 
is
travelled through by the CMB image on its long 13.7 billion years trip towards 
us. I
will mention in particular what we can learn on the dark matter distribution - 
which is
detected through its distorting effect of the CMB image by gravitational 
lensing, or
that of hot gaz, which is revealed by the spectral distortion it induces.
