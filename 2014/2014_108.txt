Speaker:    Patrice Theule (Aix-Marseille Universite)
Topic:        Formation of Complex Molecules in Interstellar Medium
Time:        6/18 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
Complex molecules could be formed in ice on interstellar grains.
The presence of interstellar ices of common molecules (CH3OH,
H2O, CO2, CO, CH4, NH3, H2CO,,,) are observed unumbiguously as
infrared bands, and are well documented.  These volatile, relatively
simple molecules likely react to form more complex organic molecules
(such as amino acids) that are difficult to explain by gas-phase
theory.  Laboratory astronomy attempts to replicate the formation
of the complex molecules through experiments under the interstellar
conditions from the detected interstellar ice conpounds.

Complex molecules such as NH2CH2COOH (glycine), C6H15N3 (formaldehyde
methylamine trimer), NH2COOH (carbamic acid) are formed in the
laboratory experiments.  These experiments do not use special trigger
such as illumination of X-ray or cosmic ray (high energy particles).
The most abundant interstellar ice is H2O (water) by order of
magnitude.  The reactants are expected to be trapped in water ice.
The reactions need to happen in the water ice at temperatures
100 - 200 K expected near protostars.
