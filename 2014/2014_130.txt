*** Special Seminar
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Ronin Wu (University of Tokyo)
Topic:        Spatially resolved physical conditions of molecular gas and potential star-forming tracers in M83, revealed by the Herschel SPIRE FTS
Time:        8/26 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
Since the launch of the Herschel Space Observatory, our understanding
about the photo-dissociation regions (PDR) has taken a step forward.
In the bandwidth of the Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS) of the
Spectral and Photometric Imaging REceiver (SPIRE) on board Herschel,
ten CO rotational transitions, including J=4-3 to J=13-12, and three
fine structure lines, including [CI] 609, [CI] 370, and [NII] 250
micron, are covered. In this talk, I present our findings from the FTS
observations at the nuclear region of M83, based on the spatially
resolved physical parameters derived from the CO spectral line energy
distribution (SLED) map and the comparisons with the dust properties
and star-formation tracers. I will discuss (1) the potential of using
[NII] 250 and [CI] 370 micron as star-formation tracers; (2) the
reliability of tracing molecular gas with CO; (3) the excitation
mechanisms of warm CO; (4) the possibility of studying stellar
feedback by tracing the thermal pressure of molecular gas in the
nuclear region of M83.
