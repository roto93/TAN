Dear All, My e-mail about EANAM6 are filtered out all the time.
          I apologize that I start to use various e-mail list, and sorry
          if you get more than once (requested by LOC/SOC).    Ing-Guey

Note: Program is settled with a compact 4-day + one discussion Friday.
      Poster contribution is still welcome, and likely to be accepted.

Dear Eiichiro, Ing-Guey, and Liang,

We are now ready for sending out the final announcement of EANAM6.
Please distribute the announcement below to your countries' astronomical
societies and colleagues around you.

Thank you very much for your help!

      The Sixth East-Asian Numerical Astrophysics Meeting (EANAM6)
      September 15-19, 2014, Suwon, Korea
      http://eanam6.khu.ac.kr

      FINAL ANNOUNCEMENT
_______________________________________________________________________

*** Science program is now available at http://eanam6.khu.ac.kr/program.html. 
***

*** Early registration is open until August 8th 
(http://eanam6.khu.ac.kr/registration.html). ***

------------------------
Aims and Scope
------------------------
Numerical simulations have played an important role in East-Asian
astronomical communities, whose access to world-level observing
facilities was rather limited until recently. Numerical simulations
have become even more important as detailed comparisons between
theories and observations are now possible at a deeper level. The
aim of  his series of meetings is to bring East-Asian numerical
astrophysicists together and provide chances to learn each other's
work and explore possible collaborations among them. The scope
of the meeting will include (but not limited to) the numerical
astrophysics of hydrodynamics, magnetohydrodynamics, radiative
transfer, planetary/stellar/galactic dynamics, and cosmology.
In addition, there will also be a focus on computer science
applications directed toward astrophysics including numerical
methods, simulation data analysis, and high performance computing.
Participants from outside of the East Asia are welcome as well.
