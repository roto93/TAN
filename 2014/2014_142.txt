Speaker:    Shou-Hsien Weng (ASIAA)
Topic:         LNA and mixer design for ALMA band-1 warm cartridge
Time:         9/22 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
ALMA band-1 is the lowest frequency band among ALMA receivers. The microwave monolithic integrated circuit (MMIC) is an attractive technique for circuit design due to its compact size, high performance, and easy to mass production. In this talk, a low noise amplifier (LNA) and a mixer are designed using MMIC technique for ALMA band-1 warm cartridge.



*** Colloquium ***

Speaker:    Eva Grebel (Heidelberg University)
Topic:         Dwarf Galaxies and Their Role as Building Blocks
Time:         9/24 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
Dwarf galaxies are the most common type of galaxy in the Universe and include the most dark-matter-dominated objects known.  They offer intriguing insights into evolutionary processes at low halo masses
and low metallicities.  Moreover, as survivors of a once much more numerous population of building blocks of larger galaxies, they are key to understanding very early star formation processes.  The Local Group and particularly the Milky Way's dwarf galaxy entourage offer us the unique possibility to compare in detail dwarf and Galactic populations. This is an important step towards quantifying the magnitude and time scales of dwarf contributions to the build-up of the Milky Way and allows us to test predictions of cosmological theories and hierarchical structure formation.

Dear Prof Kuan, please announce the following message to TAN.

Thanks.

----------------------------------------------------------

We are seeking qualified and highly motivated postdoc applicant(s) to join
our team at the Graduate Institution of Astronomy, National Central
University (IANCU). The main task for the perspective applicant is to
develop algorithms and software for analysis of the Galactic Plane Survey
data taken from the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) and intermediate PTF
(iPTF) Project (see http://www.ptf.caltech.edu/), under the collaboration
and cooperation with scientist(s) at the California Institution of
Technology (Caltech). The PTF/iPTF is a dedicated transients survey that
utilize the wide-field 48-inch Schmidt Telescope located at the Palomar
Observatory for time-domain astronomy. Also, the qualified applicant is
expected to work on scientific topics that using the data taken from the
PTF/iPTF Galactic Plane Survey, especially in the area of variable stars
(pulsating stars, eclipsing binaries, cataclysmic variables and etc). The
applicant(s) should be familiar with photometry and image subtraction
techniques. Programming language in c and/or python is recommended, but not
required. Duration of this postdoctoral position is expected to be 2 years,
with possibility of extension based on performance. Interested applicants
should prepare a CV, a short research statement, a list of publication and
arrange three reference letters to be sent to: Tracy Chiu <
tracy@gm.astro.ncu.edu.tw> (with "TANGO postdoc application" in email's
title). The deadline of application is *31-Oct-2014*.
