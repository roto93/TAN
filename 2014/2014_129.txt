Abstract: http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/activity/colloquium.php

*** Colloquium
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Masamune Oguri (University of Tokyo/Kavli IPMU)
Topic:        Gravitationally lensed supernovae
Time:        8/20 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
Gravitationally lensed supernovae are rare but
very interesting phenomena. I'll discuss why gravitationally
lensed supernovae are unique and useful, and then show that
the unusual supernova PS1-10afx found in Pan-STARRS1 was
in fact a normal type Ia supernova magnified 30 times by a
foreground galaxy, representing the first discovery of
strongly lensed supernovae.



*** Special Seminar
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Jungyeon Cho (Chungnam National University)
Topic:        Origin of Cosmic Magnetism: Primordial or Astrophysical?
Time:        8/22 (Friday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
In usual astrophysical circumstances, magnetic diffusivity is very low and, as a result, magnetic fields lines are tied to fluid elements. Therefore random turbulence motions can efficiently stretch magnetic
field lines, which results in amplification of magnetic field. This turbulence dynamo is believed to play important roles in the origin of cosmic magnetism. For turbulence dynamo, a weak seed magnetic field is required. If the seed field has cosmological origin, it could be regarded as uniform (or homogeneous) at the scale of galaxy clusters. On the other hand, if the seed field is ejected from astrophysical bodies, it could be highly localized in space at the beginning. In this talk I'll discuss growth of uniform and localized seed magnetic fields in turbulence. I will demonstrate that growth of both uniform and localized seed magnetic fields in clusters of galaxies is very similar. Therefore, it is difficult to tell whether or not the seed magnetic field has cosmological or astrophysical origin in clusters of galaxies. However, I'll show that it is possible to tell the difference between them in filaments.

Hi,

Could you please post the following conference announcement? Thanks.

Regards,

--------------- First Announcement ---------------------

      East Asian Young Astronomers Meeting 2015 (EAYAM 2015)
                    ASIAA, Taipei, Taiwan
                        February 9-12, 2015

                    http://www.eacoa.net/event/20150209

Dear Colleagues,

The East Asian Young Astronomers Meeting (EAYAM) was first organized in
2003 to promote interaction and collaboration between young astronomers in
East Asia. The success of the initial meeting in Taiwan was followed by
EAYAM 2006 in Japan, EAYAM 2008 in China, and EAYAM 2011 in Korea. We are
pleased to announce that EAYAM 2015 will once again be held in Taiwan,
between Feb. 9-12, 2015, at the Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics,
Academia Sinica (ASIAA), Taipei.

Postdocs and graduate students are encouraged to participate -- especially
those who are either originally from, or currently work in the East Asia
region. All participants are expected to give either an oral or a poster
presentation to stimulate discussion and interaction. There is no
conference registration fee, and attendance will be limited to
approximately 100 people.


To register and submit an abstract, please visit following website:
http://www.eacoa.net/event/20150209

The abstract submission deadline is November 15, 2014. If you have
any questions on EAYAM 2015, please contact
eayam2015loc@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw

EAYAM 2015 is supported by ASIAA and the Ministry of Science
and Technology, Taiwan.
