Discovery of a Strong Lensing Galaxy Embedded in a Cluster at z = 1.62

We identify a strong lensing galaxy in the cluster IRC 0218 that is
spectroscopically confirmed to be at z=1.62, making it the
highest-redshift strong lens galaxy known.  The lens is one of the two
brightest cluster galaxies and lenses a background source galaxy into
an arc and a counterimage.  With Hubble Space Telescope grism and
Keck/LRIS spectroscopy, we measure the source redshift to be z=2.26.
Using HST imaging in ACS/F475W, ACS/F814W, WFC3/F125W, and WFC3/F160W,
we model the lens mass distribution with an elliptical power-law
profile and account for the effects of the cluster halo and nearby
galaxies. The Einstein radius is R_E = 0.38" and the total enclosed
mass is 1.8x10^11 M_sun.  We estimate that the cluster environment
contributes ~10% of this total mass.  Assuming a Chabrier IMF, the
dark matter fraction within R_E is f_DM ~ 0.3, while a Salpeter IMF is
marginally inconsistent with the enclosed mass (f_DM ~ -0.3).    The
source has at least one bright compact region offset from the source
center.  Emission from Lyman alpha and [OIII] are likely to probe
different regions in the source.  This unique system is one of only a
handful that allows us to study the mass structure of early-type
galaxies at z > 1.  Current and future surveys, such as the Hyper
Suprime-Cam survey, may uncover more of these high-z lens galaxies to
better understand their physical properties and how they evolve over
time.
