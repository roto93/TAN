Dear All,

   There will be an ALMA/NAASC workshop in Charlottesville organised by =
NRAO. Below is the information about this workshop.
    Please register if you are interested in going.

Best,

Date: August 4-7, 2014

Location: Omni Hotel, Charlottesville, VA

At this workshop we will explore four central themes in the field of =
galaxy evolution by bringing together current and future studies with =
ALMA and from across the electromagnetic spectrum from existing (e.g. =
VLA/GBT/IRAM/CARMA, HST, Spitzer/Herschel, Chandra/NuStar) as well as =
future facilities (e.g., JWST, MeerKAT/ASKAP/SKA, LSST, EUCLID, =
TMT/GMT/EELT, CCAT/LMT). The four themes will be: the mass assembly =
history of galaxies and formation and evolution of galactic structure, =
the evolution of the interstellar medium and star formation over cosmic =
time, the role of large scale structure and environment and the role of =
AGN in galaxy evolution. Within these broad themes we will identify two =
to three critical questions in each area that will most benefit from the =
new data from these facilities. The participants will be invited to =
specifically address these questions. Our hope is to foster discussion =
and debate and an active exchange of ideas with the goal of energizing =
the participants to address the outstanding questions in these areas =
using multi-wavelength data from all of these facilities.=
