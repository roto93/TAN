Dear Colleagues,

The East Asian Young Astronomers Meeting (EAYAM) was first organized in
2003 to promote interaction and collaboration between young astronomers in
East Asia. The success of the initial meeting in Taiwan was followed by
EAYAM 2006 in Japan, EAYAM 2008 in China, and EAYAM 2011 in Korea. We are
pleased to announce that EAYAM 2015 will once again be held in Taiwan,
between Feb. 9-12, 2015, at the Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics,
Academia Sinica (ASIAA), Taipei.

Postdocs and graduate students are encouraged to participate -- especially
those who are either originally from, or currently work in the East Asia
region. All participants are expected to give either an oral or a poster
presentation to stimulate discussion and interaction. There is no
conference registration fee, and attendance will be limited to
approximately 100 people.
