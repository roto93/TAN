> Subject: Inspire and "The Universe"

November 7, 2014

Inspire is the High Energy Physcis information system run jointly by 
the four biggest laboratories, SLAC, Fermilab, CERN, and DESY. The 
information disseminated by Inspire is supposed to be important in the 
high energy physics community at large.

"The Universe" is the journal/newsletter of Asia Pacific Organization for 
Cosmomoly and Particle Astrophysics (APCosPA Org), launched last year 
(2013).

About a month ago, Inspire started to provide a "live" coverage of 
"Universe"; so far all the articles under "Universe" are exhibited - it is 
"live" because the current citation histories of articles are provided on 
the screen.
