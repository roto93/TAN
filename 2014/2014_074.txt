===========================
First Announcement of the 5th Fermi Asian Network (FAN) Workshop
http://crab0.astr.nthu.edu.tw/fan5/
===========================
July 28 - August 1, 2014
National Center for Traditional Arts, Yilan, Taiwan

We are delighted to announce that the 5th Fermi Asian Network (FAN)
Workshop will be held in the National Center for Traditional Arts at
Yilan, Taiwan from July 28th to August 1, 2014. The FAN collaboration
consists of high-energy astrophysicists mainly from Taiwan, Hong Kong
and Korea, and we are aiming to answer some of the major astrophysical
problems by using data taken with the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope.
Over the last few years, we have published a series of papers on
various topics related to compact objects. In order to review our
effort and expand our collaboration, we will hold the 5th workshop in
Taiwan. The core topics of the workshop will cover

* AGN/Galactic Center
* Diffuse gamma-ray sources
* Fermi transients
* Gamma-ray binaries
* Gamma-ray bursts
* Magnetars
* Millisecond pulsars
* Rotation and isolated powered pulsars
* Supernova remnants and pulsar wind nebulae
* Unidentified Fermi objects

The emphasis of this workshop will be on both discussions and formal
presentations. We will also hold a mini hand-on training course to
help students and postdoc to analyze Fermi data.

However, such format cannot accommodate a large group. Thus the total
number of participants will be limited to about 30.

Invited Speakers:
Julie McEnery (NASA Goddard Space Flight Center)
Colleen Wilson-Hodge (NASA Marshall Space Flight Center)
You-Hua Chu (UIUC)

Registration:

The registration fee is NTD 5000 and everyone is invited to
participate in this workshop.  You are encouraged to make contributed
talk related to the workshop. The workshop will provide lunches,
tea/coffee breaks, and a conference dinner (July 30). The registration
deadline is on June 15, 2014. Due to the limited space, priority will
be given to those with contributed talks. Please refer to
http://crab0.astr.nthu.edu.tw/fan5/ for registration.

Registration fee could be waived upon request. We may be able to
provide limited financial support for accommodation for students.

Note for participants from China: Because the visa application may
take over 2 months, the registration deadline for participants holding
PRC passports will be April 30, 2014.

Accommodation:
Block-booked accommodation will be provided in the Forte Dong-Shan
Villa next to the conference hall. The rate is from about NTD 1500
(sharing apartment basis) to NTD 3100 (single room) per night
including breakfast. Because of the limited number of single rooms, we
encourage to share apartments (3 persons in an apartment with 2 rooms
and 3 beds). Please indicate if you need financial support and whether
you want to share an apartment with others.

The workshop is sponsored by the Ministry of Science and Technology of
Taiwan and National Tsing Hua University.

Please contact Prof. Albert Kong (akong@phys.nthu.edu.tw) for any
questions regarding this workshop. We are looking forward to meeting
you in Yilan.

Albert Kong (Chair, SOC)
