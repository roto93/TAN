Dear All,=20

  Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute (KASI) will host a East =
Asia ALMA Science Workshop 2014 in this summer on July 14-17.

  See below for the aim of the Workshop.

  I would like to encourage you to attend if you are interested in ALMA =
science. There will be exciting discussions about ALMA science and =
collaborations.

July 14-17, 2014, Phoenix Island in Jeju

Room reservation form is available NOW. HERE

Registration deadline : June 15, 2014

The "East-Asian ALMA Science workshop 2014" will be held in Phoenix =
island, Jeju island, Korea, on July 14th - 17th, 2014, hosted by the =
ALMA Korea project group in the Korea Astronomy and Space Science  =
Institute (KASI). The LOC is pleased to host this annual joint ALMA =
science workshop of Japan, Taiwan, and Korea, especially, in the year =
when the ALMA Korea project has officially started in the KASI.

The main aim of this annual workshop is to continue promoting =
collaborations among the East Asian astronomers for ALMA sciences. =
Therefore, we will prepare ample time for group discussions, as well as =
reporting the ALMA current status, science results, and proposals. In =
addition, we will have a session for ALMA archive sciences in the =
afternoon of July 14th, 2014. Since most of Cycle 0 data were already =
archived, it is good time to think about ALMA archive sciences. Please =
join this session, hear science cases using archive data and learn how =
to navigate and collect observational data from a ALMA archive. Except =
of the archive session, most of time of July 14th will be devoted to a =
CASA (Common Astronomy Software Applications) tutorial. If you want to =
learn the CASA, please also join this tutorial session, too.

The Jeju island is the best place to relax yourself in South Korea. =
Please come to the workshop and interact with neighboring astronomers in =
a cozy environment and make future collaborations for ALMA sciences.=20=
