Speaker:    Daniel Pfenniger (University of Geneva)
Topic:        The dynamics of barred spiral galaxies
Time:        1/8 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
Most spiral galaxies are strongly or weakly barred.  The dynamics
of barred galaxies is radically different from the dynamics of
axisymmetric disks, as angular momentum and energy are no longer
conserved quantities.  Furthermore bar dynamics is fully
3-dimensional, as vertical resonances and chaotic motion
play an important role in these systems.
Understanding the dynamics of barred galaxies has turned out
to be essential for today's Galactic astronomy, for
which large-scale surveys, such as GAIA, are ongoing.
Indeed the Milky Way has been found to be a spiral galaxy with a
peanut-shaped bar, a signature of a strong and old bar.
I will review the main characteristics of barred galaxies
for an astronomer audience not necessarily familiar with
galactic dynamics.

Speaker:    Kazunori Akiyama (NAOJ/Univ. of Tokyo)
Topic:        millimeter VLBI observations of Sgr A* and M87 with VERA and EHT
Time:        1/9 (Thursday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
Despite the universality of accretion and outflow processes in a wide variety of astrophysical systems, much remains unknown about the detailed structure of the innermost regions of the accretion flow and relativistic jet in the vicinity of a supermassive black hole (SMBH). The SMBHs in the center of our Galaxy (Sgr A*) and the nearby active galaxy M87 are excellent laboratories to study these processes because the angular resolution attainable with short-mm VLBI corresponds to a few Schwarzschild radii for these sources (r_Sch = 10 microarcseconds and 7 microarcseconds for Sgr A* and M87, respectively).

For Sgr A*, we present the results of 7-mm VLBI observations with VERA, a VLBI instrument in Japan.  We report the results of multi-epoch observations of Sgr A* in 2005-2008 as well as preliminary results from monitoring that resumed in January 2013 in order to trace the effects of the G2-cloud infall event.

For M87 we show preliminary results of 1.3-mm VLBI observations with the Event Horizon Telescope in March 2012, during the middle of a period of enhancement in Very High Energy (VHE; > 200 GeV) emission. We briefly discuss implications for the structure of the M87 millimeter and VHE emission regions based on these results.

Topic:        Complex Instability in Astrodynamics
Time:        1/9 (Thursday) 16:00 - 17:00
Place:        R1107
Abstract:
Complex instability is a generic instability of Hamiltonian systems which occurs only for stationary states in systems with dimension  at least 2, and for periodic orbits in systems with dimension at least 3. Its properties have been studied since the 80's, but rigorous mathematical works are still published nowadays. I will explain complex instability for a physics oriented audience, and discuss some interesting situations concerning astrophysics.

Proposals should consist of:
1.  A proposal Cover Sheet, obtainable at http://aro.as.arizona.edu/proposals.
2.  A brief scientific and technical justification (no more than 2 pages).
3.  A source list with observing time requirements and justification, and/or
    tables, figures and references (no more than 1 page in total).
4.  Observers that plan to observe remotely must supply fixed IP address(es) of
    the computer(s) that will be used during observing on the cover sheet of the
    proposal.

Electronic submissions will be accepted in PDF format ONLY. Scheduling of
successful proposals will be done according to availability of the receivers
requested. The final proposal pdf file should be emailed to kuan@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw
by midnight (23:59 pm CST) February 07, 2014 (Friday).


Kind regards,
Yi-Jehng Kuan

Topic:        Subaru Wide-Field AGN Survey with HSC
Time:        1/15 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
Searching for quasars at various redshifts is the most fundamental 
approach to investigate the cosmological evolution of supermassive black 
holes (SMBHs). Recent reports suggest a strong evolutionary link between 
SMBHs and galaxies, telling us that the understandings of SMBHs and 
their evolution are crucial to reveal the total picture of the formation and 
evolution of galaxies, not only of quasars. In addition, high-z quasars are 
quite useful to investigate the evolution of the IGM, by providing the light 
behind the inter-galactic absorbing materials. These topics have been
extensively studied after the data release of the SDSS, that discovered
a dozens of z~6 quasars and reported the significant evolution of the
neutral fraction of the IGM at high-z. However due to the limited sensitivity
and wavelength coverage, the SDSS quasar survey could reach only up to
z~6.4 and study only very luminous population of quasars, that prevents us
from understanding the whole evolutionary picture of SMBHs and quasars.
Recent NIR surveys such as UKIDSS and VIKING is reporting a few z~7
quasars, but the resulting sample size is still insufficient for any statistical
analysis.
        For breaking this problematic situation, we are now promoting a new 
quasar survey with the new prime-focus camera for the Subaru Telescope, 
Hyper Suprime Cam (HSC). This quasar survey is a part of the HSC legacy 
survey, that is an international collaborative project among Taiwan, Japan,
and Princeton University. This HSC legacy survey has been already 
approved, and 300 nights will be dedicated in the coming 5 years. In this
colloquium, I would like to review the background, motivation, and the 
expected outcomes of this HSC quasar survey. Especially I would focus 
on the potential contribution from the Taiwanese community, which has 
access to CFHT, SMA, and ALMA. I would also briefly mention on the 
possible importance of future ALMA Band 1 for follow-up observations of 
HSC-selected high-z low-luminosity quasars.

Topic:        The LCDM Model: Successes and Future Challenges
Time:        1/17 (Friday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:        R1203
Abstract:
The LCDM model has had remarkable successes in explaining a wide array of observational evidence coming from recent cosmology experiments. Though the natures of many of the key ingredients are still largely unknown, the model is built on a small number of parameters (roughly six). In this talk, I will give a quick summary of recent progress. As part of this, I highlight some of the potentials for new discoveries in on-going surveys, with a focus on dark matter, gravitational lensing and the Dark Energy Survey (DES). One of the features of current and future surveys (such as the LSST) is that the large volume of data that these surveys will generate, combined with the stringent requirements that need to be met in order to reach our science goals, pose serious computational challenges. For these missions to be successful, these computational challenges need to be tackled.

Topic:        The Earliest Stage of Planet Formation: Disk-Planet Interactions in Protoplanetary Disks and Observations of Transitional Disks
Time:        1/16 (Thursday) 13:30 - 14:30
Place:        R1108
Abstract:
Signposts of planets in protoplanetary disks produced by disk-planet interactions may provide us a unique way to probe and study the earliest stages of planet formation. In the first part of the talk, I will introduce the concept of disk-planet interactions, then present some numerical simulations of this interaction in protoplanetary disks. Particularly, I will show gap opening in low viscosity disks by low mass planets due to the damping of the waves caused by the wave nonlinearity. In the second part, I will move on to observations of transitional disks, which are protoplanetary disks with central depleted regions (cavities), possibly been cleared out by the forming planets. Recently, Subaru directly imaged a number of such disks at near infrared (NIR) wavelengths (the SEEDS project) with high spatial resolution and small inner working angles. Using radiative transfer simulations, we study the structure of these objects by modeling observations at different bands simultane
ously. The complexity of transitional disks is reviewed by the variety of features captured in their observations, such as cavities, spiral arms, and other non-smooth/asymmetric structures in the disks, which indicates fundamentally different underlying disk structure, possibly implying different origins of these objects.
