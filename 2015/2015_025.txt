Topic:         What do we know about barred spiral galaxies?
Time:         2/2 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
I will briefly introduce some interesting aspects of gas dynamics and star formation in barred spiral galaxies. The central bar not only drives the gas into the center of the galaxy, but also excites spiral density waves in the outer part. Questions such as what are differences between them and grand-design spirals will be discussed.

Topic:         The Youngest Globular Clusters: Where They Are Born and How They Survive
Time:         2/4 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
Where are globular clusters forming today? Not in our Galaxy; none of the protoclusters in the Milky Way is likely to survive as a bound cluster.  The candidate proto-globulars in the nearby Universe are the optically hidden, deeply embedded super star clusters in starburst galaxies, where hundreds or thousands of OB stars form in volumes less than a few parsec across. Star formation eficiency (SFE) in these sources is 40 − 70%, more than an order of magnitude greater than in our Galaxy; why so high? OB stars create energetic feedback that will work to disperse the cluster: how do the clusters survive, and what do they do to the surrounding clouds? We report on SMA observations that may show how to drive high SFE, and infrared spectra of metal lines with true resolution of 3 − 5 km/sec that trace the kinematics of the ionized gas and its interaction with the ambient molecular material.
