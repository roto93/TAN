Dear Yi-Jehng,

Would you please help circulate the following conference information?
Thank you.

Dear Colleague,

This is the 1st announcement for the *IAU Symposium 323 - Planetary
nebulae: Multi-wavelength probes of stellar and galactic evolution *to be
held on *October 10-14, 2016, in Beijing, China*. The Symposium will
encompass all aspects of the impact and importance of planetary nebulae
(PNe) on stellar and galactic evolution. In particular, we expect to cover
the following topics:

- New challenges to surveys of PNe in the Local Group

- PNe as a versatile laboratory of dust and molecular studies

- From the asymptotic giant branch to the white dwarf stellar phases

- The connection between binary evolution and the PN phenomena

- Planets around evolved stars and their impact on PN formation

- PNe in nearby galaxies: probing chemical evolution and galactic dynamics

- PNe outside of the local group: Challenges to observing and interpret
distant PNe



We also expect discussion on the challenges of new and future
instrumentation as applied to the field of PNe.



More information will be posted on the *IAU Commission H3 Planetary
Nebulae* web
page at http://ast.noao.edu/activities/pn-commission/, and on the
conference's home page http://162.105.156.249/IAUS323/.



We hope to see a broad participation to this Symposium!

Xiaowei Liu, Letizia Stanghellini, and Amanda Karakas (SOC co-Chairs)

Hello all,

In lieu of Bill Borucki's cancelled talk tomorrow, another visitor to
ASIAA, Michael Busch of the SETI Institute, has graciously agreed to give a
substitute colloquium in Bill's place (see abstract below).

Michael is an expert in ground-based radar studies of near-Earth asteroids,
using facilities like Arecibo, the Goldstone Deep Space Network, the Green
Bank Telescope, and VLBA, often in coordination with each other (e.g., with
one facility transmitting and another receiving).  He will visit ASIAA
tomorrow only, and will then visit NCU on Thursday.  If you are interested
in meeting with him tomorrow (Wednesday) or joining the colloquium dinner,
please let me know.

Cheers,
Henry

*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________
Speaker: Michael Busch (SETI Institute)
Topic:  Radar Astronomy and Near-Earth Asteroids
Time:  9/30 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:   R1203

Abstract:
The near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) are a population of objects on orbits
around the Sun that pass near or cross that of Earth.  They are probes of
solar system history, accessible targets for spacecraft missions, and a
potential hazard to life on Earth.

Ground-based radar observations with large radio telescopes provide the
extremely accurate astrometry and trajectory predictions for near-Earth
asteroids. They also provide detailed information on the shapes, spin
states, and surface properties of a large number of objects; giving
essential context for spacecraft missions to asteroids.

I will describe the techniques of planetary radar astronomy and review the
capabilities of radar observations from the Arecibo Observatory, the
Goldstone Deep Space Network site,  the Green Bank Telescope, and the Very
Long Baseline Array.   Then I will detail the physical properties of a few
asteroid radar targets; including Toutatis, visited by the Chang'e 2
spacecraft in 2012, and Bennu, target of NASA's upcoming OSIRIS-REx mission.

> Subject: First Announcement =E2=80=93 Blazars through Sharp Multi-Wavelength Eyes, Malaga, May 30-June 3, 2016

  Our apologies if you receive this email more than once. Please circulate
it among your colleagues.


  We are happy to announce the following international meeting:


*Blazars through Sharp Multi-Wavelength Eyes*
M=C3=A1laga (Spain), May 30 =E2=80=93 June 3, 2016

http://jets2016.iaa.es


*FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT*


Blazars, the most extreme variety of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and the
most luminous long-lived individual objects in the universe, continue to
pose major astrophysical puzzles. This international conference will be
devoted to recent progress in observational and theoretical aspects of
blazars and advances in our understanding of the "big picture'' of the
blazar phenomenon.

Blazars radiate across the electromagnetic spectrum from radio to gamma-ray
frequencies. Observations of blazars require a variety of state-of-the-art
instruments and techniques, while understanding jet formation and
production of high-energy particles and photons is among the most prominent
problems of modern astrophysics.

The timing of the conference is well matched to the availability of premier
high-energy facilities, such as the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, the
Chandra, Swift, NuSTAR, and Astrosat X-ray satellites, new high-resolution
arrays such as the Event Horizon Telescope, RadioAstron, and ALMA,
sensitive very high-energy gamma-ray Cherenkov detectors, and long-term
monitoring with the Very Long Baseline Array, Global mm-VLBI Array, and
optical-IR telescopes.

The meeting will have the extra motivation of celebrating Prof. Alan
Marscher's contributions to blazar research.

Topics to be discussed include:

   - Jet formation, dynamics, and astrometry
   - Probes of blazar jets with the finest angular resolution through EHT,
   mm-VLBI, and RadioAstron observations
   - Multi-wavelength studies of blazars from theory and observations
   - Magnetic fields and polarization
   - Non-blazar AGN jets


Prof. Alan Marscher will present an especial talk with a =E2=80=9CRetrospec=

view of the Blazar science=E2=80=9D, while Prof. Esko Valtaoja will give an=

Speaker:        Brett Gladman (Univ. of British Columbia)
Topic:          Steady consolidation of exoplanet systems
Time:           10/5 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
The Kepler mission results indicate that systems of tightly packed inner planets (STIPs) are present around of order 5% of FGK field stars (whose median age is ~5 Gyr). We propose that STIPs initially surrounded nearly all such stars, and those observed are the final survivors of a process in which long-term metastability eventually ceases and the systems proceed to collisional consolidation or destruction, losing roughly equal fractions of systems every decade in time. In this context, we also propose that our solar system initially contained additional large planets interior to the current orbit of Venus, which survived in a metastable dynamical configuration for 1%-10% of the solar system鈥檚 age. Long-term gravitational perturbations caused the system orbits to cross, leading to a cataclysmic event that left Mercury as the sole surviving relic.

 Deadline:  November 02, 2015, 08:00 UT.
*********************************


Dear Colleagues.

 We invite proposals for the open use observations of the KaVA, a joint
VLBI array
 of the KVN (Korean VLBI Network) and the VERA (VLBI exploration of Radio
 Astrometry). The joint array consists of three 21-m KVN telescopes and
 four 20-m VERA telescopes, with baseline lengths ranging from 300 km to
2300 km.

 This open-use call will be based on risk-share, and provide VLBI
observations at
 22GHz and 43GHz for astronomers in the world. We can support astronomers
who are
 not familiar with VLBI technique in the preparation of proposals,
scheduling, and data
 analysis. Proposers are requested to include at least one collaborator
from VERA or KVN.
 If it is difficult to find collaborators from VERA or KVN, we can support
to find them.
 The contact address for the support is kavaprop (at-mark) kasi.re.kr.

 Observations will be conducted with single polarization (LCP) and 1-Gbps
data rate.
 The total available observation time is up to 250 hours and the
observations will be
 scheduled between January15, 2016 and July 15, 2016. The maximum observing
 time per proposal is 48 hours.
 If requested in the proposals, the observation time can be allocated over
a year,
 until January 15, 2017, for this call. But the maximum observation time
will be NOT increased.
 The deadline of submission is at 08:00 UT November 02, 2015.
 More detailed information on the KaVA call-for-proposal can be found in
 http://kava.kasi.re.kr/contents/proposal_info.php?mid=020101

 ToO opportunity
 Target of Opportunity proposals can be submitted to regular CfP of KaVA.
 Also, unexpected or urgent ToO can be submitted Director's time at any
time.
 These proposals must include specific triggering criteria to initiate a
observation.
 The ToO is active one year from it is approved. The proposals to
Director's time must be
 submitted by PDF files using e-mail to kavaprop (at-mark) kasi.re.kr.

 If you have any questions, please send an email to kavaprop (at-mark)
kasi.re.kr
