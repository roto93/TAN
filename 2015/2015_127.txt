*NCU Astronomy Colloquium*
Speaker: Dr. Hou Xian (Yunnan Observatory, China)
Topic: Fermi-LAT gamma-ray pulsars
Time: Jun 26, 2pm
Place: S4-1013, NCU

Abstract:
The Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board the Fermi satellite provided us an
excellent opportunity to study gamma-ray pulsars with more than 160
detections after six years of operation. Pulsars are by far the largest
source class in the Galactic plane at GeV energies. I will describe the
techniques used in the LAT pulsar searches and the gamma-ray pulsar
population thereby established, including implications of the observation
in terms of emission properties and population statistics. Biases existing
in the current gamma-ray pulsar sample will be demonstrated by detections
of some faint ones. I conclude with some prospects for future gamma-ray
pulsar discoveries as the LAT extends its mission.
