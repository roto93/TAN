*NCU Astronomy Colloquium*
Speaker: Mr. Howard Chen (Boston University)
Topic:Modeling Highly Irradiated Very Low Mass Gaseous Exoplanets with
Stellar Evolution Code MESA
Time: May 19, 2pm
Place: S4-1013, NCU

Abstract:
The discovery of over 4,000 exoplanet candidates has unmasked the
strangeness of planetary systems in the solar neighborhood. For instance,
most of the confirmed planets reside in orbital periods of less than 100
days around their respective host stars, which places them well within the
orbit of Mercury. In this talk, I present a prescription to expand the
capabilities of the stellar evolution code Modules for Experimental Stellar
Astrophysics (MESA) to model gaseous planets in highly irradiated
environments. I will illustrate how we modified MESA to include planet core
luminosity, heavy element enrichment, and mass loss due to hydrodynamic
winds. Using these dynamical models, we then constructed mass-radius
relationships of planets from 1 to 20 Earth Mass and investigated how
mass-loss impacts their composition and evolution history. We anticipate
that this versatile, user-friendly code will see widespread applications in
complementing future exoplanetary surveys such as *K2*, *TESS* and *PLATO*.
