Speaker:        Yun-Hsin Huang (The University of Chicago)
Topic:          On the possible origin of cool gas around massive, red and dead galaxies
Time:           7/13 (Monday) 12:20 - 13:00
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Analytical calculations and hydrodynamical simulations have shown that in massive dark matter halos (> 10^12 solar mass), gas is shock heated to virial temperature that little cool gas can survive.  However, deep 21 cm observations reveal that some early-type galaxies are in fact rich in HI gas.  The presence of cold gas challenges the theoretical understanding of how massive galaxies grow and evolve.  Beyond the local Universe, observations of QSO absorption-line systems offer a powerful tool for studying the otherwise invisible gas.  I will summarize absorption-line studies that probe the presence of cool (~10^4 K) gas around massive galaxies.  In particular, I will talk about our recent study of cool gas content around massive, luminous red galaxies (LRGs) at z~0.5 from SDSS DR12, the largest galaxy and QSO samples available to date.  The unparalleled constraints on the presence of cool gas gives us insights into the origin of the gas.  I will discuss possible physical me!
 chanisms which could attribute to the observed cool gas and how we could test different scenarios in the future.
