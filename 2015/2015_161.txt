*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________
Speaker:        Kevin Heng (University of Bern)
Topic:          Exoplanetary Atmospheres in Eras
Time:           9/14 (Monday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
The observational scrutiny of the atmospheres of exoplanets is now a legitimate field of inquiry, which has motivated their theoretical study.  In this review talk, I will summarise and highlight the state of the art of both observations and theory of exoplanetary atmospheres.  The review is organised into eras, starting from the birth of spectrophotometry to the upcoming set of next-generation exoplanet hunters and characterisers.  On the observational side, I will review spectrophotometry, phase curves, eclipse mapping, direct imaging and ultra-high-resolution spectroscopy.  On the theoretical side, I will review atmospheric radiation, chemistry and circulation (fluid dynamics).  I will discuss the problem of bright stars and why we need the next-generation of exoplanet hunting machines (CHEOPS, TESS and PLATO) to build up a better target list for atmospheric characterisation.  Finally, there will be a discussion of the habitable zone and also how the conversations between!
  the scientists from different sub-disciplines need to be more constructive.

Speaker:        Brett Gladman (University of British Columbia)
Topic:          Resonant Kuiper Belt Objects
Time:           9/16 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Orbital resonances play a major role in the distribution of small bodies in our Solar System, and almost certainly in other planetary systems.  They sometimes serve as traps, and in other situations are a rapid source of instability.  This talk will present a primer on orbital resonances and then discuss the resonant populations present in our Kuiper belt.  The resonance dynamics in the Kuiper belt is complex but is yielding its secrets to careful survey work, like the Outer Solar System Origins Survey (OSSOS) running on CFHT via a joint Canada+France+Taiwan team.  Some of the selection effects in outer Solar System surveys will be illustrated, which need to be understood for projects like LSST.  The early Solar System processes which created these resonant populations will be outlined, providing a window into planetary formation and evolution.
