Title:
The Reversal of the Star-Formation Density Relation in High Redshift
Clusters

Abstract:
The star-formation density relation is one of the cleanest pieces of
evidence of the effect of environment on galaxy evolution. We are used to
the observations that clusters are dominated by "red and dead" galaxies
especially at the densest cluster cores. As all galaxies must have been
"star-forming" at some time, this indicates that some feature of these
dense regions has acted to transform star-forming galaxies into the passive
populations in the past. On the other hand, the fraction of star-forming
galaxies in clusters indeed increases rapidly with redshift. However, this
vigorously star-forming systems are generally found on the outskirts of
clusters with z<1. Only recently, we started to identify strongly star
forming galaxies at the very center of the cluster cores at z~1.5 and
beyond. Thus, at these redshifts, the star-formation rate does not drop at
the densest region anymore. In the talk, I will report our result of the
extensive dusty star forming galaxies found in one massive cluster at
z=1.46 using the SCUBA2 850um data, and discuss its impact to the formation
of massive elliptical galaxies in clusters.
