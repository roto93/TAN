Topic:         Baryon Content of Massive Galaxy Clusters
Time:         1/12 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
Understanding how the cluster and group baryon components evolve with redshift is a key question today. While there have been many detailed studies of intermediate and high redshift galaxy clusters, most previous observational studies of large cluster samples have focused on nearby systems due to the difficulty of defining high redshift samples and of following them up in the X-ray and with adequately deep optical or near-infrared imaging. That is changing now with the recent analyses of Sunyaev-Zelâ€™dovich effect selected clusters and groups at intermediate and high redshift. In this talk I will present the recent work of the multi-wavelength study of baryon content for massive galaxy clusters selected by South Pole Telescope.


*** ASIAA/NTU Joint Colloquium ***

Speaker:    David Spergel (Princeton University)
Topic:         Planck and Beyond
Time:         1/13 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         Physics 104
Abstract:
The Planck Telescope has made an accurate full-sky measurement of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature, the leftover heat from the Big Bang. These measurements probe both the physics of the very early universe and the basic properties of the universe today. The Planck measurements confirm the earlier results from the WMAP telescope and rigorously test our standard cosmological model and provide an accurate determination of basic cosmological parameters (the shape of the universe, its age, and its composition). When combined with other astronomical measurements, the measurements constrain the properties of the dark energy and the nature of dark matter. The observations also directly probe the physics of first moments of the Big Bang: the current data are consistent with the idea that the early universe underwent a period of rapid expansion called inflation.

Many key cosmological questions remain unanswered: What happened during the first moments of the big bang? What is the dark energy? What were the properties of the first stars?  Dr. Spergel will discuss the role of ongoing and future CMB observations and describe how the combination of large-scale structure, supernova and CMB data can be used to address these key cosmological questions.

Topic:         New Insights into Dust in the Environments of Novae from Chiron Spectroscopy
Time:         1/14 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
When I started using SMARTS to observe galactic novae nearly 12 years ago, little did I know how challenging and engrossing this endeavor would prove.  After all, the "nova problem" has been solved many times, and the novae have been thought to be almost fully understood. This could not be further from the truth.

Novae, thermonuclear runaways on the surfaces of white dwarfs, explode and interact with their environments on timescales of days to years, which is ideal for synoptic monitoring with the SMARTS facilities at CTIO.  After an introduction, I will discuss what high-cadence optical and near-IR photometry tells us about the formation of dust in novae. But photometry only tells part of the story.  I shall focus on high-cadence high resolution optical spectroscopy of two disparate novae, the recurrent nova V745 Sco and the slow nova V1369 Cen.  High spectral resolution reveals never-before seen details which likely will permit us to map the circumstellar environments of the long-period symbiotic systems like V745 Sco.

V1369 Cen put on a show over Christmas 2013. Like other slow, dust-forming novae, it had multiple optical outbursts. Each of these corresponds to the appearance of a new spectroscopic absorption system.  Nearly-daily observations for 5 months let us trace the dynamics of the envelope, and perhaps to view dust formation.

In the past most novae have been ignored once they faded; long-term synoptic photometry and spectroscopy are showing that the novae are far more complex than we had assumed, but appropriate observations can and are revealing new truths about these "new stars".
