Dear Colleague, 

This is to announce the opening of Call for Proposals 
for the Subaru Telescope open use semester S15B 
from 2015 August 1 through 2016 January 31. 

Detailed Information on the available instruments 

[HSC, HDS, IRCS, Suprime-Cam, FMOS, COMICS, MOIRCS, 
FOCAS, AO188 (NGS or LGS; usable with IRCS)] 

and the details concerning proposal submission are available 
at the following website: 

http://www.naoj.org/Observing/Proposals/Submit/call.html 

Please visit this site and read the description carefully 
before submitting your proposals. 

The deadline for Normal/Intensive Programs is 

<<<March 10 (Tue), 2015, 12:00 (Noon) in JST>>> [e.g., 3.00am in UT], 

while that for the Service program is 4 weeks later than this 
(April  7 (Tue), 2015, 12:00 (Noon) in JST). 

While only several important points are briefly summarized below, 
please consult the web page for more detailed information. 

(1) Abstract of Accepted Proposals Going to Be Opened 

The complete text of the abstract of all the accepted Subaru 
proposals from S15B semester will be open to the public 
at the same time of the data release (i.e., after the proprietary 
period of 18 months has expired). 

(2) New Science Category 'Metal-poor stars' 

A new category 'metal-poor stars' has been introduced mainly for 
proposals intending to observe individual old stars as probes 
to study chemical evolution (nucleosynthesis history) of our Galaxy 
or local-group galaxies. 

(3) Use of Hyper Suprime-Cam 

Regarding HSC, there will be 4 observing runs (allocated to dark 
or dark-gray nights in August, October, November, and January). 
One narrow band filter (NB816) will be opened from S15B. 

(4) Polarimetry Mode of IRCS+AO188 

In S15B, polarimetry modes of IRCS+AO188 are newly available 
for imaging (for Y-, J-, H-, and K-bands) as well as spectroscopic 
observations (for zJH and HK) in a shared-risk operation. 
IRCS observations will be conducted always in combination with 
AO188 optics, regardless of the use of AO correction. 

(5) Possibility of Instrument Decommission 

Please keep in mind the possibility that S-Cam and/or FMOS, 
which are available as usual still in S15B, might be decommissioned 
and unavailable from S16A. Similar decommissioning is under 
consideration also for HiCIAO and/or Kyoto3DII (PI instruments). 

(6) MOIRCS Detector Replacement 

Due to the detector replacement work, MOIRCS can not be used 
in early S15B for about 2 months but expected to be available 
from 2015 October in a shared-risk mode. 

(7) Application from Keck/Gemini Community 

Non-Japanese PIs who wish to use the Subaru Telescope but have 
access to Keck or Gemini telescope time should in principle 
apply through the time-exchange programs provided by Keck or Gemini. 

Best regards, 

Subaru Open Use Team
