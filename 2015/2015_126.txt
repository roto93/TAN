Speaker:        Kensei Kobayashi (Yokohama National University)
Topic:          Search for Relics of Chemical Evolution Toward Life’s Origin in Space
Time:           6/25 (Thursday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Life’s origin was one of the biggest riddles remained for us.  Since 1950s, a large number of laboratory experiments and theoretical consideration have been made to solve it.  The standard scenario of the origins of life today is as follows:  (1) Organic compounds such as amino acids were formed in primitive Earth environments or delivered from space, (2) further chemical evolution toward the first life system occurred in the primitive ocean.  In addition, the possibility that life itself was delivered from space, now referred to as panspermia hypothesis, should also taken into account.  However, the relics of the first life as well as organic compounds used for the first life were not remained in the present Earth.

In these days, it becomes possible to find such relics in extraterrestrial environments.  Primitive organic compounds in comets and asteroids can be directly studied through space missions.  Titan, the largest moon of Saturn, may reserve some relics of chemical evolution in its atmosphere and liquidosphere.  Mars and some other solar system bodies may cultivate life systems different from terrestrial one.  In the colloquium, possibilities to find relics of chemical evolution in space will be introduce, as well as the results of laboratory experiments simulating chemical evolution in primitive environments.
