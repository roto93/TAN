To promote collaboration between Japan and Taiwan on the gravitational
wave detector, KAGRA, a 1-day workshop will be held on December 23,
2015 at National Tsing Hua University. This workshop is the first
collaboration meeting and will focus on instrumentation, data
analysis, and science related to KAGRA, a gravitational wave detector
being built in Japan.

Key members from the KAGRA team (including the PI, Prof. Takaaki
Kajita, Nobel Laureate in Physics of 2015) will report on the progress
of the project and discuss with Taiwanese scientists for possible
collaboration. We strongly encourage researchers and students who are
interested in gravitational wave science and instrumentation to
participate the workshop.

Speakers:
Takaaki Kajita (ICRR, University of Tokyo; Nobel Laureate in Physics of 2015)
Nobuyuki Kanda (Osaka City University)
Seiji Kawamura (ICRR, University of Tokyo)
Ken-ichi Oohara (Niigata University)

Shiuh Chao (NTHU)
Sadakazu Haino (Academia Sinica)
Albert Kong (NTHU)
Wei-Tou Ni (NTHU)
Hwei-Jang Yo (NCKU)
