*** ASIAA/NTU Joint Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________
Speaker:        William Borucki (NASA Ames Research Center)
Topic:          Kepler mission results: discoveries from astrophysical and
exoplanet investigations
Time:           9/29 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           physics 104
Abstract:
At the time of the first Kepler proposal, no exoplanets had been
discovered. At the conclusion of the Mission, over 4600 planetary
candidates had been discovered and a new era of astronomy has opened.
Planets have been found with average densities as low as Styrofoam
(0.05 gr/cc) and as high as that of tungsten (17 gr/cc), and with
sizes between that of the Moon to double that of Jupiter. Planets are
found orbiting much closer to their star than Mercury does to the Sun,
but Jupiter-size planets in such locations are rare. The high
frequency of 4- and 5-planet systems indicates that flat systems are
common. However, in about 20% of planetary systems, a planet is found
orbiting at a large angle to the stellar equatorial plane. Very
compact systems are common and many of the planets are in
near-resonant orbits, but seldom in resonant orbits. Planets are found
in binary and trinary star systems. Because circumbinary planets show
very irregular transit signatures, most are found by visual inspection
rather than by automated searches. Planets in the habitable zone are
common. A combination of several observational and modeling techniques
is used to deduce the characteristics of the planets and the host
stars. Observational techniques include; high-precision radial
velocity measurements to deduce planetary masses, spectroscopic
observations to characterize host stars, adaptive optics, speckle, and
HST to search for background stars that could account for the transit
signal or dilute it, and Spitzer IR observations to check that the
transits are achromatic. Analysis and modelling techniques include;
asteroseismic analysis to determine stellar size age, and density from
p- and g-mode observations, modeling techniques using Markov-chain
Monte Carlo methods to get best-fit values for planetary and stellar
parameters, statistical analysis to estimate the frequency of
false-positive events, and stellar-evolution models to deduce stellar
size and age. Results from the Kepler Mission show that the average
number of planets per star exceeds one.

Because Kepler has observed over 170,000 stars nearly continuously for
four years, many unusual stars have been found and the information
needed for the determination of rotation rates of the cores of giant
stars and the identification of those stars that are hydrogen-shell
burning versus those that are helium-burning is clear. Examples of the
results are presented.

Topic:          Development of the Kepler mission
Time:           9/30 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
The Kepler Mission is a space observatory launched in 2009 by NASA to
monitor 170,000 stars for four years to determine if Earth-size and
larger planets in and near the habitable zone of solar-like stars are
common or rare in our galaxy. The Kepler Mission has been very
successful: over 4600 planetary candidates have been found with an
enormous range of sizes, temperatures, and types of stellar hosts. In
particular, exoplanets near the size of Earthâ€™s moon to those larger
than Jupiter have been found with orbital periods that range from 8.5
hours to over 1000 days. Dozens of planetary candidates in the
habitable zone have been found. Analysis indicates that those smaller
than 1.6 times the radius of Earth are likely to rocky planets whereas
planets substantially larger are likely to have substantial
hydrogen/helium atmospheres. Planets and planetary systems completely
different from our Solar System are common. Results from the Kepler
Mission show that the average number of planets per star exceeds one;
planets are more common than stars.

To be successful, the Mission development required overcoming many
barriers. No spacecraft mission had ever been flown that could do
automated photometry of 170,000 stars simultaneously with the 10 ppm
photometric precision necessary to discover the thousands of planets
needed to obtain reliable statistics of exoplanet distributions. It
took seventeen years of effort before NASA agreed to fund the Kepler
Mission concept for development. To gain acceptance, it was necessary
to accomplish the following steps:

1) demonstrate that an appropriate combination of detectors and data
analysis techniques was available that had the precision necessary to
detect transits of Earth-size planets,

2) prove that the variability of solar-like stars was likely to be
sufficiently low that transits from Earth-size planets could be
detected with high reliability,

3) demonstrate automated observations of thousands of stars
simultaneously and automated analysis of the observations, and

4) develop a lab test facility to demonstrate 10 ppm photometric
precision needed to find Earth-sized planets orbiting solar-like stars
in the presence of the noise expected from on-orbit operation.

The methods used to overcome these barriers will be presented. A brief
summary of the most exciting discoveries will also be provided.
