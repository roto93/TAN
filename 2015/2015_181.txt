Place:           R1203


*** CompAS Seminar ***

Speaker:        Dr. Philipp Moesta (UC Berkeley)
Topic:          MHD-driven Supernovae in Three Dimensions
Time:           10/15 (Thursday) 13:30 - 14:30
Place:           R1108
Abstract:
Core-collapse in rapidly rotating, strongly magnetized progenitors may power some of the most luminous supernovae we observe and possibly set the stage for a subsequent long gamma-ray burst. I will present results from new three-dimensional (3D) general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. First, I will discuss how an m=1 kink instability of the ultra-strong toroidal magnetic field affects jet stability and the dynamics, geometry and nucleosynthetic signature of MHD-driven explosions. In the second part, I will discuss how MHD turbulence in rapidly rotating protoneutron stars can generate magnetar-strength magnetic fields that may help power hyper-energetic and super-luminous supernovae.


*** Special Seminar ***

Speaker:        Ming-yi Lin (MPE)
Topic:          Thick Disks of Dense Gas around the Nuclei of Nearby Seyfert Galaxies
Time:           10/15 (Thursday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
We will present the dense molecular gas in the central regions of nearby Seyfert galaxies, focusing on the HCN(1-0) and HCO+(1-0) molecules which have been observed by Plateau de Bure Interferometer (PdBI). In one remarkable case, NGC 3079, we will discuss the origins and implications for the double blue-shifted absorption lines. We combine our new data with similar observations in the literature to create a sample of 8 Seyferts with comparable data. In 7 of these, the emission line kinematics implies thick disk structures of 50-100pc scales, suggesting such structures are a common occurrence. We find a relation between the circumnuclear HCN luminosity and dynamical mass that can be explained by a gas fraction of ~10% and a conversion factor of ~10. Adopting a different perspective to probe the physical properties of the gas close around AGN, we report on an analysis of molecular line ratios which indicates that the clouds in this region are not self-gravitating. Finally (if!
  it still has time), we will briefly introduce the current status of Swift-BAT AGN large program.
