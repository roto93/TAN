*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________
Speaker:        Cynthia Chiang (University of KwaZulu‑Natal)
Topic:          Searching for the Echoes of Inflation with SPIDER
Time:           9/23 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
The cosmic microwave background (CMB) is a powerful tool for cosmology, encoding a wealth of information about the universe's history and structure.  In particular, precision CMB polarimetry has long held the promise of revealing the physics of inflation through a minuscule "B-mode" imprint that is imparted by primordial gravitational waves.  I will discuss our current knowledge of CMB polarization, and I will describe a new instrument, SPIDER, that aims to characterize the inflationary B-mode signal with high sensitivity and fidelity.  SPIDER is a balloon-borne telescope that launched from McMurdo Station, Antarctica on January 1, 2015, and successfully observed for 16 days.  I will discuss the preliminary in-flight performance and prospects for the science analysis.

Topic:          HIRAX and the Search for Fast Radio Bursts
Time:           9/24 (Thursday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
The Hydrogen Intensity and Real-time Analysis eXperiment (HIRAX) is a
proposed array of 1024 cheap 6m dishes that has received preliminary
approval from the South African NRF.  The main goals of HIRAX include
measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations at redshift 0.8-2.5,
searching for new pulsars and radio transients, and discovery of new
neutral hydrogen absorbers.  Preparations for HIRAX include the
development of a new pipeline to search for Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs),
which are some of the most enigmatic things in the sky.  They burst
incredibly brightly (~10 Jy) for a millisecond, never to be seen
again, and their origin and even distance (and hence energy scale) is
completely unknown.  We have run the trial pipeline on 650 hours of
suitable GBT data looking for FRBs.  We present an overview of HIRAX
and preliminary results from the FRB search.
