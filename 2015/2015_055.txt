===============================================================================

The Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) is the largest ground based astronomical project ever carried out. Led by a worldwide consortium, this new generation telescope will entitle us to unveil the origin of our Universe as well as the origin of Life.

The University Consortium of ALMA-Taiwan (UCAT) is embarking to this unprecedented project and is inviting students to apply to the UCAT Summer Student program, where they will have the opportunity to lead unique groundbreaking research under the guidance of astronomers. Opportunity is open to about 10 students with preference given to the junior level or higher, and who are majoring in any scientific topic (physics, mathematics, chemistry, computer science, engineering, and of course astronomy).

Students will attend a series of lecture designed for them in the Summer School, to introduce them to ALMA, Radio-astronomy, and the different possible subjects of research. Also, all students are required to give an oral report of their research projects at the conclusion of the program, and to provide a written report suitable for the WEB.

The successful candidates will work at UCAT member universities from 2015 July 01 (Wed) to August 28 (Fri). The salary will be NT$20,000 per month. A brief description of the research projects offered can be found on the website (http://ucat.es.ntnu.edu.tw/tuCASA/USSP2015/ ).  USSP2015 Program poster can be downloaded at http://ucat.es.ntnu.edu.tw/tuCASA/USSP2015/USSP2015_poster_A4.pdf ) 

To apply, please fill out and send the registration form (http://ucat.es.ntnu.edu.tw/tuCASA/USSP2015/USSP2015applicationform.doc) to Ms. Emily Wang (chihliwang@ntnu.edu.tw) before April 10 (Fri). The applicants have to indicate on their application the project or projects of their greatest interest and provide for recommendation letters (up to two, at your option). Results of admission will be announced on May 05 (Tue).

Announcement
Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics
2015 Summer Student Program: Call for applicants

Are you interested in astronomy and astrophysical research? Are you
looking for a full-time summer intern to participate the academic
research of the astronomy, astrophysics, or astronomical
instrumentation?

If so, then you are encouraged to apply for the ASIAA summer student
program. Participants attend regular seminars designed specifically to
teach them about the various fields in astronomy. They will also
conduct scientific research (either theoretical, computational, or
laboratory-based) under the supervision of a professional astronomer
at ASIAA.

Time: July 01-August 28, 2015

Qualified Applicants: undergraduate students majoring in astronomy,
physics, chemistry, electrical engineering, computer science, or any
related topics on science and engineering. All applicants will be
considered, but juniors, seniors or entering master’s students are
preferred.

Now a list of the projects and the web application system are open.

Period for Application : February 27 – March 20, 2015.

Speaker:Yong Tian (NTU)
Title: "Gravitational Lensing in Relativistic MOdified Newtonian Dynamics".
Abstract:
"The dark matter, or more accurately =E2=80=9Cmissing mass=E2=80=9D, probl=
em could well be
the most important and most long standing issue in astrophysics. In this
work, we review this problem from the galaxies scale to the cosmology.
Then, we focus on the alternative solution =E2=80=9CModified Newtonian Dyna=
mics=E2=80=9D
(MOND) which interprets =E2=80=9Cmissing mass=E2=80=9D as =E2=80=9Caccelera=
tion discrepancy=E2=80=9D.
We also introduce relativistic gravity theories in MOND. Our work focuses
especially on gravitational lensing and time delay within the relativistic
version of MOND. We derive the lensing formulation in relativistic MOND and
test it on strong lensing cases. Although the results are preliminary for
the spherically symmetric case, the lens mass of an elliptical galaxy in
lensing and the Hubble constant in time delay are still consistent within
the relativistic MOND paradigm. Moreover, the masses of lens galaxies
estimated from dynamics and from gravitational lensing are also consistent
in our study."

Speaker:    Shih-Ping Lai (NTHU)
Topic:         In Quest of the Youngest Protostars and Protoplanetary Disks
Time:         3/11 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
Finding the youngest protostars and proto-planetary disks and investigating their environment is a critical step toward fully understanding of star formation.  In this talk, I will present the work my students and I have done on this subject. (1) Discovering a extremely young Keplerian disk around Class 0 protostar VLA1623A with SMA and ALAM data (Murillo et al, 2013), (2) Introducing "Multi-D" - a new method we developed for identifying faint YSO population in Giant Molecular Clouds using multi-band photometry data (Hsieh & Lai 2013), and (3) Molecular line observations showing that Very Low Luminosity Objects (VeLLOs) are most likely young protostars (Hsieh et al, 2015, in print).
