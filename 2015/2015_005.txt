Dear colleagues

we would like to draw your attention to the first NARIT International
Astronomical Training Workshop (NIATW) that will take place from March 25
to April 2, 2015, in Chiang Mai (Thailand) and at the nearby Thai National
Observatory on Doi Inthanon.

The workshop aims at providing a hands-on experience with the 2.4-m Thai
National Telescope and its modern instrumentation for both imaging and
spectroscopy. The participants will take part in a number of observational
programs, obtain original data, and learn the steps of data reduction to
reach science-grade results.

The focus of this first NIATW is about time-variable phenomena,  with
emphasis on short time scales from less than one day  to sub-seconds.
Examples are: stellar pulsation, oscillations,  occultations, transits,
compact binaries.  Also the use of archival data will be promoted.

The workshop is organized by NARIT, in coordination and with sponsorship of
the IAU Office of Astronomy for Development. It is open to advanced
students and professional astronomers. Priority will be given to applicants
from countries where such training opportunities and facilities are scarce,
however there is no geographical restriction.

Participation is free of charge, as well as accomodation for the whole
duration of NIATW. Participants are expected to cover their travel
expenses, but a limited amount of financial support could be available in
special cases.

*We would be very grateful if you could please help disseminate this
announcement*. Detailed information and the online registration form are
available at http://www.narit.or.th/en/index.php/niatw2015

with best regards
Prof. Boonrucksar Soonthornthum (NARIT Director)
Dr. Andrea Richichi (NIATW Coordinator)
