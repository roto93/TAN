Dear colleagues

This is the second announcement concerning the Summer School
on the Cosmic Distance Scale which will be held in
the University of Tokyo, Japan, from Mon 29 June to Fri 3 July 2015.
The registration is now open on our web site.
This school will cover a wide range of distance measurement techniques
from trigonometric parallaxes to cosmological distance measurements
and related scientific topics. Distinguished lecturers in various fields
will give dedicated lectures on the basics and cutting edge of the field
of distance measurement as well as on expected future developments.

<Participants>
  We will mainly consider PhD course and master course students
  as well as early-career postdocs.
  The expected number of the participants is 80 including
  both international (~40) and domestic (~40) attendees.
  We will likely receive registration requests from senior researchers,
  but will give priority to younger participants in our selection.

<Participant presentations>
  We call for both oral and poster presentations by participants.
  There will be slots for a limited number of oral/poster
  presentations by participants, but selection will be made based on
  the abstracts and other information provided at registration.

<Registration>
  Please make the registration on our web site.
  Applications for participant presentations and travel supports
  can be also submitted.
  If you are a student, please provide the information on your supervisor
  or a person who could serve as a reference whom we may contact
  before your participation is approved.
  If you are a postdoc, please provide the information on
  your PhD degree in the registration.

<Registration Fee>
  For early registrations (by 30 Apr) : 22,000 JPY
  For regular registrations (by 31 May) : 28,000 JPY
  The registration fee includes all course material, refreshments during
  coffee breaks, a banquet dinner, and a half-day excursion trip.
  We will start receiving the payment of the registration fee on 12 May
  and all the participants should complete the payment by 31 May.
  Details for the payment will be announced later to those who registered.

<Social Events>
  We will organise a banquet dinner and a half-day excursion trip
  around Tokyo city.

<Scientific Rationale>
  The Cosmic Distance Scale plays a fundamental role in a broad range of
  topics in astronomy. This is because it is not easy to know distances
  to astronomical objects and yet the distances are important to study
  many characteristics of the objects, such as their luminosities and
  masses, sizes and ages. An accurate distance scale is also required to
  reconstruct the structure and evolution of the Universe itself.
  Continuing efforts have been made to develop the Cosmic Distance Scale
  ever since very early pioneering works such as the first measurements
  of trigonometric parallaxes in the 19th Century and the discovery of
  the period-luminosity relation of Cepheids around a hundred years ago.
  There have been great advances in the recent decades; for example,
  supernova distance measurments enabled us to discover the accelerating
  expansion of the Universe. On the other hand, accurate measurements of
  the cosmic background radiation made it possible to study the
  structure and evolution of the Universe, which is one of the main
  goals to establish the Cosmic Distance Scale.

  An important aspect in measuring astronomical distances is that no
  single method can be used for the entire range from the proximity
  within the solar system to the distant Universe. Therefore, it is
  important to keep the methods well-calibrated step-by-step from the
  starting point based on trigonometric parallax. In this context, this
  is a very exciting time because the Gaia will provide unprecedented
  measurements of parallaxes in the very near future, which will have a
  large impact on the entire range of the Cosmic Distance Scale. There
  are also high-impact projects ongoing and planned, which will deliver
  new insights into the structure of the Universe including several
  projects led by Japan such as JASMINE, VERA, and, SuMIRe. While recent
  developements of observational facilities and techniques have made it
  feasible to measure distances to objects across the entire range of
  the Universe, recent achievements have demonstrated that it is
  important to make the distance indicators both precise and robust.
  Such recent developements require us to understand the accuracy, range
  of application, and limits to each method and how it is related to
  other methods.

  In this school, distinguished experts in various fields will give
  lectures on the basic principles of the methods to the expected
  progress in the near future. It will be a good opportunity to share a
  broad perspective on the Cosmic Distance Scale among young astronomers
  who will play an active role in a wide range of astronomy. The Cosmic
  Distance Scale indeed covers various fields of astronomy which are
  related to one another, and this school will also offer a chance to
  spend time with international young astronomers working in different
  subfields.

<School Evaluation>
  We will conduct a process evaluation of the summer school in
  collaboration with and endorsed by the International Astronomical
  Union's Office of Astronomy for Development through East Asian
  Regional Office of Astronomy for Development (EA-ROAD).
  The evaluation process will consist of asking prospective participants
  to answer a set of questions to gauge their level of understanding
  prior to the school, followed by a similar exercise towards the end of
  the school. This evaluation will offer us an opportunity to measure
  changes in participants' knowledge and understanding.
  This collaboration with the EA-ROAD will be useful in developing
  a framework to assess the efficacy of future summer schools
  supported by the International Astronomical Union.
