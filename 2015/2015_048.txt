*NCU Astronomy Colloquium*
Speaker: Kevin Walsh (Southwest Research Institute (SwRI))
Topic:Asteroid Dynamics and Geology - Origin of near-Earth Asteroids
Time: Feb. 26, 2pm
Place: S4-1013, NCU

Abstract:
Multiple space missions are headed off to return samples from near-Earth
Asteroids. However, near-Earth Asteroids are a transient population with
their population being constantly re-plenished with bodies from the Main
Asteroid belt. The Main Asteroid belt is a big place with lots of diversity
and all regions and asteroid types can make the trip to become near-Earth
Asteroids.  Therefore, context for a returned sample requires connecting a
specific near-Earth Asteroid with a region in the Main Asteroid Belt or
ideally a specific family of asteroids.  However, the dynamical evolution
of asteroids from the Main Belt to the near-Earth population requires
asteroids to drift due to a radiation effect, which itself depends on the
shape and surface properties of the asteroid. This is complicated by the
ability of small asteroids to reshape due to rotation rate changes brought
about by related, but different, radiation effects. This intersection of
asteroid dynamics and geology is critical for understanding the evolution
of the asteroid belt and the delivery of near-Earth Asteroids over time. I
will discuss a hunt for the source region of a space mission target
asteroid, why that led to the discovery of a new asteroid family and how
the reshaping of km-sized asteroids is the critical physics in
understanding which is the actual parent family.

*** Special Seminar ***
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Vincent Desjacques (University of Geneva)
Topic:         Beyond CMB: large scale structure probes of inflation
Time:         3/2 (Monday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
CMB measurements furnish to date the tightest constraints on the nature of the primordial fluctuations and, thereby, the physics of inflation. Interestingly, independent and competitive constraints can be obtained by measuring large scale density fluctuations in the low redshift Universe. I will describe recent theoretical and observational developments and show that, in the long run, large scale structure surveys may achieve limits  on the primordial non-Gaussianity an order of magnitude better than Planck.



*** Colloquium ***

Speaker:    Jun Hashimoto (Oklahoma University)
Topic:         Near-Infrared Imaging Observations of Transitional Disks in the Subaru/SEEDS project
Time:         3/4 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
SEEDS is a strategic project in the Subaru telescope exploring exoplanets and circumstellar disks around 500 stars in the near-infrared wavelengths. The project has started in 2009 and will be completed in this year. Here, we review the project and summarize the major results especially in the survey of protoplanetary disks by near-infrared polarimetric imaging. In observing protoplanetary disks, we mainly focus on transitional disks known as a protoplanetary disk with a cavity in a central region of a disk. Disk-planet interaction would be one of intriguing interpretations potentially responsible for such a cavity-structure. Thus, transitional disks would be unique samples for understanding planet formation in a disk.

As results of tens of observations in transitional disks, we have resolved fine structures in disks such as spirals, gaps, and dips at a radius of tens AU possibly due to gravitational interactions with unseen planet(s). These results may support planet formation at a wide orbit, e.g., GJ 504 b at 43 AU. We also found differences in structures of a cavity observed in the near-infrared and (sub-)millimeter wavelengths, i.e., a clear cavity in (sub-)millimeter wavelengths while no cavity in near-infrared wavelengths. The different behavior between small (sub-micron size) and large (millimeter size) dust grains would be consistent with disk-planet interaction plus dust filtration. Finally, we mention our preliminary results of disk demographics in transitional disks based on SEEDS data.

Time:         3/4 (Wednesday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:         R1203


*** CompAS Seminar ***
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Dr J.J. Eldridge (The University of Auckland)
Topic:         Binary Population and Spectral Synthesis of high-redshift galaxies and core-collapse supernova.
Time:         3/5 (Thursday) 13:30 - 14:30
Place:         R1108
Abstract:
Most widely used population and spectral synthesis codes only rely on single star models. There are exceptions but haven't been able to become more widely used than Starburst99 and  Galaxev (Bruzual and Charlot) models. The BPASS collaborations (bpass.auckland.ac.nz) are attempting to change that, we have created a binary population synthesis code that uses a large grid of detailed stellar evolution models to account for the effect of interacting binaries.

I will discuss the code and the models and outline some of the astrophysics results we have achieved with the code concerning high-redshift galaxies and core-collapse supernovae. I will also outline out future aims and plans.
