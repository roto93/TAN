> Subject: ASIAA colloquium/visit tomorrow - Michael Busch
> From: Henry Hsieh <hhsieh@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw>
> To: circular_colloquium@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw

Hello all,

In lieu of Bill Borucki's cancelled talk tomorrow, another visitor to
ASIAA, Michael Busch of the SETI Institute, has graciously agreed to give a
substitute colloquium in Bill's place (see abstract below).

Michael is an expert in ground-based radar studies of near-Earth asteroids,
using facilities like Arecibo, the Goldstone Deep Space Network, the Green
Bank Telescope, and VLBA, often in coordination with each other (e.g., with
one facility transmitting and another receiving).  He will visit ASIAA
tomorrow only, and will then visit NCU on Thursday.  If you are interested
in meeting with him tomorrow (Wednesday) or joining the colloquium dinner,
please let me know.

Cheers,
Henry

*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________
Speaker: Michael Busch (SETI Institute)
Topic:  Radar Astronomy and Near-Earth Asteroids
Time:  9/30 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:   R1203

Abstract:
The near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) are a population of objects on orbits
around the Sun that pass near or cross that of Earth.  They are probes of
solar system history, accessible targets for spacecraft missions, and a
potential hazard to life on Earth.

Ground-based radar observations with large radio telescopes provide the
extremely accurate astrometry and trajectory predictions for near-Earth
asteroids. They also provide detailed information on the shapes, spin
states, and surface properties of a large number of objects; giving
essential context for spacecraft missions to asteroids.

I will describe the techniques of planetary radar astronomy and review the
capabilities of radar observations from the Arecibo Observatory, the
Goldstone Deep Space Network site,  the Green Bank Telescope, and the Very
Long Baseline Array.   Then I will detail the physical properties of a few
asteroid radar targets; including Toutatis, visited by the Chang'e 2
spacecraft in 2012, and Bennu, target of NASA's upcoming OSIRIS-REx mission.
