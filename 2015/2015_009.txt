Dear Dr. Kuan, 

I am writing to you about a small workshop 'Icy Grain Chemistry for Formation
of Complex Organic Molecules: From Molecular Clouds to Protoplanetary Disks,
Comets and Meteorite' which will be held in Tokyo Tech. during 5-7 March.

Please have a look at the attached announcement and the workshop web site for
the details. If you could kindly help us to circulate the announcement to those
who may be interested in the workshop, I shall very much appreciate it!

Thank you very much for your kind consideration. 


Best wishes, 
Hideko

"Icy Grain Chemistry for Formation of Complex Organic Molecules: 
From Molecular Clouds to Protoplanetary Disks, Comets and Meteorites" 
March 5 - 7, 2015 at Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan 
http://www.geo.titech.ac.jp/lab/nomura/grain_chem/index.html 

*Abstract Submission Deadline : January 30, 2015* 

Thanks to development of infrared and mm/submm instruments, more than 
170 molecules have been detected in the interstellar medium (ISM). 
Complexity of the detected molecules is increasing, and now ALMA 
(Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array) is challenging to detect 
amino acids in the ISM. On the other hand, amino acids have been discovered 
in comets and meteorites in our Solar System, and it is an open question 
how the complex organic molecules in our Solar System have been formed 
from the molecules found in the ISM. 

Formation processes of complex organic molecules in space are not 
understood very well, but grain surface chemistry is thought to play 
an important role. Modelling grain surface chemistry has been developed 
for decades, but it still contains many uncertainties due to difficulty 
in laboratory experiments and theoretical calculations. 

In this workshop we would like to discuss how we can develop chemical 
reaction network of grain surface reactions/icy mantle reactions based 
on laboratory experiments and theoretical calculations of basic processes. 
We aim to understand formation processes of complex organic molecules/ 
prebiotic molecules found in comets and meteorites through chemical 
reactions in protoplanetary disks and molecular clouds. 

We look forward to fruitful discussions with participants working on 
laboratory experiments, theoretical calculations of basic processes 
and chemical reaction network, astronomical observations of complex 
organic molecules, and wide range of fields.
