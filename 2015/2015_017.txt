Topic:         ALMA Observations of the Transition from Infall Motion to Keplerian Rotation around the Late-phase Protostar TMC-1A
Time:         1/26 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
In the course of star formation, infalling envelopes around protostars are considered to transform into Keplerian rotating disks. The disk formation process is, however, still not understood well. Our ALMA Cycle 0 observations toward the late-phase protostar TMC-1A have revealed the existence of a 100 AU-size Keplerian disk surrounded by an infalling envelope around the protostar. Interestingly, the infall velocity of the envelope is found to be 0.3 times as large as the corresponding free fall velocity. Possible mechanism to reduce the infall velocity and a disk formation scenario are also discussed.


*** Special Seminar ***

Topic:         The Current Status of the Yuan T Lee Array
Time:         1/27 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
The Yuan T. Lee Array for Microwave Background Anisotropy, or AMiBA, is a radio interferometry array for cosmology experiments. It consists of 13 co-planar, dual-polarization receivers operation at 3 mm wavelength. Its backend is a 4-lag, analog correlator covering a baseband bandwidth of 2-18 GHz, but with almost no spectral resolution capability. The 7-element AMiBA was dedicated in 2006, and subsequently upgraded to the full 13-element Array in 2010. The full array operations has continued for four years and finally ended by 2014. In this talk, I will report on the AMiBAâ€™s current status, particularly on the development of the wide-band digital correlator. This development has enabled new capability for the Yuan T Lee Array, and is preparing the instrument for new research in cosmology science. I will show you the recent testing results of a 4-station digital correlator, and our plan for a new science endeavor to understand the physics during the Epoch of Re-ionization !
using the Yuan T. Lee Array.

Topic:         How Do Galaxies Stop Forming Stars?
Time:         1/28 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
The Local Universe provides an excellent laboratory for studying the detailed processes of star formation and galaxy evolution. In this seminar, I will present some recent highlights from my work on blue early-type galaxies.  Our latest model demonstrate that the observed "Green Valley" can be reproduced by two star formation truncation pathways for the evolution of galaxies.  We previously found that the local post-starburst galaxies occupy a well-defined region in the low-mass end of the "Green Valley" and that even though star formation has only recently turned off, their morphology already resemble those of the low-mass red sequence galaxies. Since the post-starburst population is far too evolved, we probed the atomic gas content of its predecesssor population, namely, the blue early-type galaxies to search for the smoking gun that caused the sudden truncation of star formation.  Our pilot study suggest that a kinetic process (probably AGN feedback) is driving the quick !
truncation of star formation in these systems, rather than a simple exhaustion of gas supply.  In this talk I will also briefly describe some early results from the Radio Galaxy Zoo project.
