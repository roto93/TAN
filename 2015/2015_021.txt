Dear Yi-Jehng, 

Please help circulate the following announcement of job panel discussions in TAN. 
Is it possible to circulate in TAN for the following two issues in case students/postdocs miss the first announcement? 
If you think it is not necessary, it is also ok we just circulate once. 

Thanks! 

Tangtang.

Panel discussions on career development and job options during East Asian Young Astronomers Meeting (EAYAM) 2015. 

There will be panel discussions on the career development (11:30-12:30 on 2/10) and alternative job options (17:15-18:00 on 2/12) during the EAYAM meeting. Students and postdocs are welcome to attend. During the panel career development, we will invite faculties at various stage, from junior professor/researcher to senior director, to share their experiences.  
For the panel on alternative job options, we will invite some directors and people in the industry to tell us what are the people they are looking for. The discussion will be in Chinese. Please sign up in the following website in advance if you plan to come to the panel on the alternative job options.
