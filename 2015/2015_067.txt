*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Erick Young (SOFIA Science Center)
Topic:         SOFIA, The Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy -- Science Highlights and Observing Opportunities
Time:         3/25 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
The Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA), is a highly modified Boeing 747-SP aircraft that has a 2.7-m telescope. Flying above more than 99% of the absorbing water vapor in the Earth's atmosphere, SOFIA provides access to otherwise unobservable wavelengths in the infrared to the worldwide astronomical community. SOFIA entered the Full Operations phase in February 2014, and is supporting observing proposals from astronomers all over the world. The project is an international collaboration between the US and Germany and has required high levels of coordination and communication among the many partners. The airplane has recently returned from an extensive periodic maintenance, and has resumed the science observation program. The plan for 2015 includes support for six science instruments, a deployment to the Southern Hemisphere, and support for an occultation of Pluto. This talk will cover some of the technical challenges in making SOFIA a reality, and will h!
ighlight some of the recent science results.  Observing opportunities for Cycle 4 are described.

*NCU Astronomy Colloquium*
Speaker: Dr. Sundar Srinivasan (ASIAA)
Topic: The dust return from AGB stars in nearby galaxies
Time: Mar. 27, 2pm
Place: S4-1013, NCU

Abstract:
Asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars lose a substantial fraction of their
mass in slow, dust-driven winds. This mass loss directly influences the
life cycle of dust and gas in galaxies. The dust consists of either
oxygen-rich or carbonaceous partiels, depending on the relative atomic
abundance of carbon to oxygen (the C/O ratio) in the photospheric regions.
Determining the current rate of AGB dust production requires information
about the spectral energy distributions (SEDs), especially in the infrared.
While large-scale studies of the Galactic AGB dust budget have been
restricted to the Bulge or the Solar Neighbourhood, data from the Spitzer
Space Telescope has enabled the identification of large AGB populations in
nearby galaxies such as the Magellanic Clouds, allowing us to estimate the
current AGB dust budget in these systems. These studies find that the dust
production is dominated by a small fraction of very dusty, highly evolved
stars. However, the global estimates seem too small to explain the observed
interstellar dust mass. In this talk, I will review the theoretical and
observational constraints on AGB dust production in nearby galaxies and
discuss possible solutions to the dust budget "crisis".

Dear All,

Here we announce the upcoming Crash Course for the Python programming
language to take place on July 6-10, 2015, ASIAA.

http://events.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/school/20150706/index.php

This course is highly recommended by Prof. You-Hua Chu to all astronomers
based in Taiwan, especially to students entering the field of Astronomy and
Astrophysics.

Please note that the lab sessions are *required* for all participants and
based which lunch boxes will be provided.

All participants will need to bring their own laptops meeting requirements
of operating systems with necessary software packages downloaded, installed
and tested prior to the course. Further updates including the
download/installation instructions and minimal requirements for the laptops
will be available in late spring/early summer.  Details of the syllabus may
be revised and updated.

Cheers,

Sienny
