*** Colloquium ***

Speaker:        Rachel Mandelbaum (CMU)
Topic:          Galaxy halo masses and implications for galaxy evolution from weak lensing measurements
Time:           1/15 (Friday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
In the past decade, weak gravitational lensing has become one of the best ways of measuring galaxy halo masses for galaxy samples at low to intermediate redshifts.  Measurements of the average halo density profiles for galaxies with a given luminosity or stellar mass (observable mass proxies) have revealed a great deal about the connection between halo masses and these mass proxies.  After a broad overview of what such measurements have shown us in several datasets, I will describe some recent measurements in the SDSS that illustrate a bimodality in halo mass at fixed stellar mass, with red galaxies that reside at the centers of dark matter halos having host halo masses that are a factor of 2-3 larger than those that host blue central galaxies.  I will discuss the implications of these results for models of galaxy formation and evolution, and also propose future measurements with upcoming datasets such as HSC that will shed further light on the relevant galaxy formation and !
 evolution processes.
