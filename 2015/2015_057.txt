Title:An exceptionally powerful trio in the Large Magellanic Cloud

Abstract:
The Large Magellanic Cloud, a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, has
been observed with the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.)
above an energy of 100 billion electron volts for a deep exposure of
210 hours. Three sources of different types were detected: the pulsar
wind nebula of the most energetic pulsar known, N 157B; the radio-loud
supernova remnant N 132D; and the largest nonthermal x-ray shell, the
superbubble 30 Dor C. The unique object SN 1987A is, unexpectedly, not
detected, which constrains the theoretical framework of particle
acceleration in very young supernova remnants. These detections reveal
the most energetic tip of a gamma-ray source population in an external
galaxy and provide via 30 Dor C the unambiguous detection of gamma-ray
emission from a superbubble.
