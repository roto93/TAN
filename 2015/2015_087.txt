Topic: Roadmap for CMB Polarization Measurements with POLARBEAR, Simons
Array and LiteBIRD

Abstract:
Cosmological inflation, which is the leading hypothesis to resolve the
problems in the Big Bang theory, predicts that primordial
gravitational waves were created during the inflationary era.
Measurements of polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB)
are known as the best probe to detect the primordial gravitational
waves. POLARBEAR is designed to measure CMB polarization with an array
of TES bolometers. It has been in operation since 2012 in the Atacama
desert in northern Chile. The main scientific objective of POLARBEAR
is to search for primordial gravitational waves imprinted as the
=E2=80=9CB-mode=E2=80=9D in the CMB polarization maps. Another important go=
al is to
measure a spatial distortion of the CMB polarization maps due to
gravitational lensing, which is a very sensitive probe for the
large-scale distribution of matter in the early universe and will
constrain the sum of neutrino masses. The Simons Array is an expansion
of the POLARBEAR. It will consist of an array of three 3.5m telescopes
each coupled to a multichroic TES bolometer pixel, so that it will
provide very powerful foreground rejection capability and much deeper
observation. Finally, LiteBIRD is a satellite project to map CMB
polarization over the full sky at large angular scales with ultimate
precision. The LiteBIRD proposal was submitted to JAXA in February
2015 with the target launch in Japanese fiscal year 2022. The
scientific objective of LiteBIRD is to test all the representative
inflation models that satisfy single-field slow-roll conditions and
lie in the large-field regime. To this end, the requirement on the
precision of the tensor-to-scalar ratio, r, at LiteBIRD is equal to or
less than 0.001, a hundred times better than the current constraint.
