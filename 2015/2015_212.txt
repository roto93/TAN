Japan-Taiwan Workshop on KAGRA
December 23, 2015
National Center for Theoretical Sciences, National Tsing Hua University
http://phys.cts.nthu.edu.tw/actnews/?Sn=261

To promote collaboration between Japan and Taiwan on the gravitational
wave detector, KAGRA, a 1-day workshop will be held on December 23,
2015 at National Tsing Hua University. This workshop is the first
collaboration meeting and will focus on instrumentation, data
analysis, and science related to KAGRA, a gravitational wave detector
being built in Japan.

Key members from the KAGRA team (including the PI, Prof. Takaaki
Kajita, Nobel Laureate in Physics of 2015) will report on the progress
of the project and discuss with Taiwanese scientists for possible
collaboration. We strongly encourage researchers and students who are
interested in gravitational wave science and instrumentation to
participate the workshop.

Speakers:
Takaaki Kajita (ICRR, University of Tokyo; Nobel Laureate in Physics of 2015)
Nobuyuki Kanda (Osaka City University)
Seiji Kawamura (ICRR, University of Tokyo)
Ken-ichi Oohara (Niigata University)

Shiuh Chao (NTHU)
Sadakazu Haino (Academia Sinica)
Albert Kong (NTHU)
Wei-Tou Ni (NTHU)
Hwei-Jang Yo (NCKU)

Please refer to our workshop homepage
(http://phys.cts.nthu.edu.tw/actnews/?Sn=261) for registration. Short
15-min presentations about your works and ideas related to KAGRA are
still welcomed. Please contact Prof. Albert Kong
(akong@phys.nthu.edu.tw) for details.

Speaker:        Hiro Takami (ASIAA)
Topic:          Stable and Unstable Regimes of Mass Accretion onto a T Tauri Star
Time:           12/14 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:           R1203


*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________
Speaker:        Stefan Hilbert (Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München)
Topic:          Linking Gravitational Lensing Observations and Theory with Simulations
Time:           12/16 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Gravitational lensing effects allow us to study the the large-scale geometry and matter distribution of our Universe, and thereby can provide unique insights into, e.g., the nature of dark energy, dark matter, and their connection to the luminous matter. Numerical simulations are essential for the quantitative interpretation of gravitational lensing observations and for extracting accurate constraints for physical models of galaxies, the large-scale structure, and our whole Universe. I discuss several applications of numerical simulations to better understand strong and weak gravitational lensing observations for cosmology.


*** Special Seminar ***
____________________________________________________
Speaker:        Sperello di Serego Alighieri (INAF - Osservatorio Astrofisico di Arcetri)
Topic:          Dust in Early-Type Galaxies
Time:           12/17 (Thursday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Dust is an important component of the multi-phase interstellar medium of Early-Type Galaxies (ETG) and can give important clues on the origin and evolution of ETG.
After an introduction to the subject I will show and discuss recent results obtained on the dust content of a complete sample of 910 ETG in the Virgo cluster with the Herschel satellite and on a comparison of these data with those obtained on a similar sample of H-ATLAS/GAMA ETG in low density environment.

"Globular Cluster Survey of the Shapley Supercluster”

Globular cluster populations were instrumental in helping humans find
their place in the universe.  Now they are studied to find possible
clues to galaxy formation. Recent evidence shows that number of
globular clusters (GC), Ntot, scales with dark matter halo mass of the
host galaxy, Mhalo.  The correlation between Ntot and Mhalo gives us a
window into GC formation efficiency.  We are probing the high mass end
of this relation by investigating the globular cluster systems of 11
giant elliptical galaxies in clusters associated with the Shapley
Supercluster, the largest mass concentration in the local universe and
possibly a major source of the Local Group's 630 kms motion with
respect to the cosmic microwave background.  The sample galaxies were
imaged with the Advanced Camera for Surveys Wide Field Channel in the
F814W bandpass and are in the redshift range z=0.035-0.048.
We find a nonlinear relationship between the host galaxy luminosity LV
and number of globular clusters Ntot , with Ntot  scaling as LV to the
power of 1.6; thus, the GC specific frequency SN increases with LV for
these high-mass galaxies. Our data show good consistency with the
U-shape relationship between SN and host galaxy magnitude MV found in
other recent GC studies. Galaxies at intermediate luminosities near
the low-point of the U have both the lowest SN values and highest
stellar mass ratios, indicating that Ntot scales more closely with the
dark halo mass than with stellar mass. For one galaxy in our sample,
ES0325-G004, additional multi-band imaging was obtained, and we find a
bimodal globular cluster color distribution with characteristics
typical of most giant ellipticals.

Spiral Structure in Disks

I will review some mechanisms for generating spiral structures in
astrophysical disk systems such as galaxies and protoplanetary disks.
In particular, I will talk about my research on instabilities of the
galactic spiral arms, namely feathering instability. Feathering
instability may be responsible for the regular density structures
commonly found near the spiral arms. In the second part of my talk, I
will introduce some of my attempts to understand the three-dimensional
spiral shocks in a protoplanetary disk.


12/18, 1pm, R521

Sperello di Serego Alighieri (Arcetori),

The rich Interstellar Medium of Early Type Galaxies

 Early type galaxies (ETG) were once thought to be devoid of
interstellar medium (ISM), just red and dead.More recently it has been
established that they have a rich ISM, from the hot gas emitting in
X-rays to the very cold molecular gas and dust.I will review the ISM
of ETG, show how the various gas phases can survive together, and
discuss what we can learn about the evolution of ETG from their ISM.
