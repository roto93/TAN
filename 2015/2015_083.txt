2015 Advanced Telescope and Instrument Technology Conference
              August 30 to September 4
              Hualien, Taiwan
                ------------

Every two years, instrument scientists and engineers across the Taiwan Strait
gather to report the telescope and instrument projects being carried out. The
next one, the sixth in the series, will be held in Hualien from August 30 to
September, 2015.  A total of 120 attendants from China and Taiwan are expected
to exchange experience, to discuss ongoing projects, and to strike possible new
collaborations.  In view of FAST, Subaru/PFS, TMT, SKA, zTF, and the initiatives
in Antarctica, just to name a few, we certainly look forward to an exciting
meeting.  The meeting will be conducted in Chinese, but presentations can be in
English.  For information, registration, and submission of presentations, please
