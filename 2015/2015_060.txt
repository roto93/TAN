*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Matteo Barnabè (University of Copenhagen)
Topic:         The dark and luminous structure of massive galaxies
Time:         3/18 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
Understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies remains among the foremost open problems in present-day astrophysics and cosmology. A reliable and detailed description of the density profile, mass budget, structural properties and stellar initial mass function of galaxies through cosmic time is a much-needed step forward but – whereas nearby systems have been subject to intense scrutiny – painfully little is known about more distant ones, since observational limitations make it challenging to employ the traditional diagnostic tools.
I will demonstrate how these difficulties can be overcome by combining the information obtained from all the available constraints: strong gravitational lensing, extended stellar kinematics and stellar population synthesis modeling. This approach makes it possible to conduct unprecedentedly detailed and robust investigations of the dark and luminous structure of massive ellipticals beyond the local Universe and, for the first time, to put strong constraints on both the steepness and the elusive lower mass cut-off of their stellar IMF. Finally, I will discuss how this joint technique can take full advantage of present and upcoming state-of-the-art instruments in order to advance our understanding of galaxy structure at higher redshifts and beyond the current mass frontier.
