Speaker:        Jen-Wei Hsueh (UC Davis)
Topic:          Find dark subhalos with strongly lensed quasars
Time:           12/28 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Missing satellite problem is one of the mystery in modern cosmology. I will talk about how astronomers detect satellite galaxies and subhalos in distant galaxies with gravitational lensing. And why strongly lensed quasars provide an ideal approach to understand the missing satellite problem.


*** ASIAA/NTU Joint Colloquium ***

Speaker:        Ue-Li Pen (Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics, University of Toronto)
Topic:          Past, present and future of Fast Radio Bursts:
the brightest events in the universe since the big bang
Time:           12/29 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           Physics 104
Abstract:
I report on recent progress to understand the nature of fast radio bursts. Most properties are inferred through propagation effects, including dispersion, scattering, scintillation, and rotation measure. I will review the issues, survey some of the proposed candidates ranging from terrestrial to cosmological, and conclude with prospects for the near future.
