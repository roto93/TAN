Hello,

Would you please help circulate the colloquium information with TAN?

thanks.

*NCU Astronomy Colloquium*
Speaker: Prof. Pisin Chen (NTU)
Topic: Radiowave Detection of Ultra High Energy Cosmic Neutrinos and Cosmic
Rays
Time: Sep. 25, 2pm
Place: S4-1013, NCU

Abstract:
There have been exciting advancements in searching for ultra high energy
cosmic neutrinos in recent years. In addition to important results from
IceCube, there have been a series of experiments/observatories based on the
Askaryan effect and geomagnetic synchrotron effect for detection that aim
at the detection of highest energy cosmic neutrinos. Among them the
balloon-borne ANITA project has made its 3rd mission in Antarctica in the
2014-2015 winter. Ongoing ground-based projects include ARA (Askaryan Radio
Array)at the South Pole and ARIANNA on Ross Bay Shelf, Antarctica. The
Taiwan team has been playing a leading role in ARA since its inception. The
antenna stations built by the Taiwan team has been collecting data since
their deployment 2.5 years ago. Several more stations, again built by the
Taiwan team, are now scheduled to be deployed at the Pole in the coming two
years. Last but not least, taking advantage of steep high mountains along
Taiwan=E2=80=99s East Coast, we have launched an exciting new observatory b=
y the
name =E5=A4=AA=E9=AD=AF=E9=96=A3, or TAROGE (Taiwan Astroparticle Radiowave=
 Observatory for
Geosynchrotron Emission), to look over the Pacific Ocean in search of ultra
high energy cosmic rays and earth skimming neutrinos. In this talk we will
review these activities as well as their physics potentials and future
prospects.
