Dear Friends, 
  There will be a small Symposium at National Taiwan University in 
Taipei during April 8-9, to discuss future prospects for probing the 
very high energy particle Universe, which is in part motivated by the 
PeV neutrino events seen by IceCube. Although time is rather close, 
the location is also close by. We encourage you to join if you have 
the time and interest. The agenda, as well as the webpage, is given 
below.

Title: Enigma of near-infrared background

Abstract:

  It has been thought first stars of the universe are very massive and
luminous, however, it is
difficult to detect individual stars even with JWST. We have tried to
observe near-infrared
background to detect integrated redshifted light of first stars. Space
probes (COBE,
IRTS, AKARI and Spitzer) succeeded to detect excess sky brightness and
fluctuation
that can not been explained with known foreground emission sources. Recent
sounding
rocket experiment, CIBER (Cosmic Infrared Background ExpeRiment) also
detected large
excess brightness and fluctuation at 1.0 and 1.6 micron. However, recent
observational
evidences and theoretical studies make it difficult to attribute observed
excess brightness
and fluctuation to first stars. IHL (Intra Halo Light) surrounding low z
galaxies and DCBHs
(Direct Collapsed Black Holes) at high z are proposed, but have difficulty
to explain
observational results. It is now enigma what emission source can explain
observed excess
brightness and fluctuation of near-infrared background.

<Scientific Rationale>
  The Cosmic Distance Scale plays a fundamental role in a broad range of
  topics in astronomy. This is because it is not easy to know distances
  to astronomical objects and yet the distances are important to study
  many characteristics of the objects, such as their luminosities and
  masses, sizes and ages. An accurate distance scale is also required to
  reconstruct the structure and evolution of the Universe itself.
  Continuing efforts have been made to develop the Cosmic Distance Scale
  ever since very early pioneering works such as the first measurements
  of trigonometric parallaxes in the 19th Century and the discovery of
  the period-luminosity relation of Cepheids around a hundred years ago.
  There have been great advances in the recent decades; for example,
  supernova distance measurments enabled us to discover the accelerating
  expansion of the Universe. On the other hand, accurate measurements of
  the cosmic background radiation made it possible to study the
  structure and evolution of the Universe, which is one of the main
  goals to establish the Cosmic Distance Scale.

  An important aspect in measuring astronomical distances is that no
  single method can be used for the entire range from the proximity
  within the solar system to the distant Universe. Therefore, it is
  important to keep the methods well-calibrated step-by-step from the
  starting point based on trigonometric parallax. In this context, this
  is a very exciting time because the Gaia will provide unprecedented
  measurements of parallaxes in the very near future, which will have a
  large impact on the entire range of the Cosmic Distance Scale. There
  are also high-impact projects ongoing and planned, which will deliver
  new insights into the structure of the Universe including several
  projects led by Japan such as JASMINE, VERA, and, SuMIRe. While recent
  developements of observational facilities and techniques have made it
  feasible to measure distances to objects across the entire range of
  the Universe, recent achievements have demonstrated that it is
  important to make the distance indicators both precise and robust.
  Such recent developements require us to understand the accuracy, range
  of application, and limits to each method and how it is related to
  other methods.

  In this school, distinguished experts in various fields will give
  lectures on the basic principles of the methods to the expected
  progress in the near future. It will be a good opportunity to share a
  broad perspective on the Cosmic Distance Scale among young astronomers
  who will play an active role in a wide range of astronomy. The Cosmic
  Distance Scale indeed covers various fields of astronomy which are
  related to one another, and this school will also offer a chance to
  spend time with international young astronomers working in different
  subfields.

<School Evaluation>
  We will conduct a process evaluation of the summer school in
  collaboration with and endorsed by the International Astronomical
  Union's Office of Astronomy for Development through East Asian
  Regional Office of Astronomy for Development (EA-ROAD).
  The evaluation process will consist of asking prospective participants
  to answer a set of questions to gauge their level of understanding
  prior to the school, followed by a similar exercise towards the end of
  the school. This evaluation will offer us an opportunity to measure
  changes in participants' knowledge and understanding.
  This collaboration with the EA-ROAD will be useful in developing
  a framework to assess the efficacy of future summer schools
  supported by the International Astronomical Union.

Topic:         Atmospheric Dynamics on Extrasolar Planets
Time:         4/8 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
By far, the most thoroughly observationally and theoretically characterized extrasolar planets are the class of short-period, highly irradiated, gas-giant planets. Though much of our understanding of atmospheric dynamics and planetary evolution is derived from solar system planets, observations and models of these exoplanets have suggested the dynamics of their atmospheres is dramatically different than anything within our own solar system. Their short-periods suggest that these planets are tidally locked to their host stars, resulting in extremely large longitudinal temperature gradients. Coupled to the planets rotation, this results in semi-static, supersonic jets that dominate all other dynamical features above pressures of several thousand bars. I will discuss the multiple aspects of these models utilizing 3D radiative hydrodynamical models coupled to a variety of models exploring jet formation, the formation of exotic clouds, and overall planetary evolution. Detailed â€!
˜observationsâ€™ of our models allow us to both benchmark our models and predict future observations.

*NCU Astronomy Colloquium*
Speaker: Dr. Chi-Yi Chou(ASIAA)
Topic:The Subaru Prime Focus Spectrograph Project in ASIAA
Time: Apr,10, 2pm
Place: S4-1013, NCU

Abstract:
The Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS) is a new fiber based
optical/near-infrared multi-fiber spectrograph designed for the prime focus
of the 8.2m Subaru telescope. PFS shares the same wide field corrector for
the Hyper Suprime Cam on Subaru telescope providing a 1.3 deg2 FOV. The
expected spectral resolving power is 3000 and 5000 for the low and mid
resolution mode, respectively. PFS is composed of four major subsystems: 1.
the prime focus instrument which locates at the telescope prime focus
containing 2400 motorized fibers; 2. fiber cable system that connects the
prime focus instrument and the spectrohraph system; 3. spectrograph system
that disperses light from the fibers; and 4. the metrology camera system
that locates at the cassegrain focus monitoring the position of motorized
fibers. ASIAA is in charge of designing and manufacturing of the prime
focus instrument and the metrology camera systems. I will start with
general aspects of this project (e.g., purpose, science goals, comparison
to other similar projects), and followed by brief introduction of the
subsystems. In the end I will share the current status of our recent work.
