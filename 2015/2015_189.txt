*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________
Speaker:        Christy Tremonti (University of Wisconsin–Madison)
Topic:          Star Formation-Driven Galactic Winds: Physical Properties and Implications for Galaxy Evolution
Time:           11/5 (Thursday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
A central issue in galaxy evolution is understanding the 'baryon cycle', namely how gas is accreted onto galaxies and expelled in galactic winds.  I will describe some on-going work to measure galactic winds at both low and intermediate redshift using UV/optical absorption line spectroscopy.  I will show how outflow velocities scale with galaxy physical properties such as stellar mass, star formation rate, and morphology and I will consider the implications of these trends. Finally, I will discuss star formation feedback at its most extreme and its role in shaping the progenitors of today’s giant elliptical galaxies.
