*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________
Speaker:        Roger Blandford (KIPAC)
Topic:          The Accelerating Universe
Time:           7/22 (Wednesday) 16:30 - 17:30
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
From keV electrons in terrestrial aurorae to Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays in unidentified "Zevatrons", the cosmos shows a plutocratic proclivity to concentrate energy in a tiny minority of suprathermal particles. The particle acceleration mechanisms involved can be traced back to the ideas of Faraday, Fermi and Alfvén though we are learning that the details are idiosyncratic and much can be learned from comparing and contrasting particle acceleration in laboratory and cosmic locations. Special attention will be given to acceleration accompanying strong shock fronts, spinning, magnetized compact objects and a new, general mechanism called “magnetoluminescence”.

Topic:          ALMA Observations of B335: Do Stars Form by Collapse?
Time:           7/23 (Thursday) 16:00 - 17:00
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Observations of the isolated globule B335 with ALMA have yielded absorption features against the continuum that are redshifted from the systemic velocity in both HCN and HCO+ lines. These features provide unambiguous evidence for infall toward a central luminosity source.  Models of inside-out collapse from an isothermal sphere can match the observed line profiles of HCN and HCO+ averaged over the central 50 AU.
