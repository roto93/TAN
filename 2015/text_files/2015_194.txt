Dear Colleagues,

We are pleased to announce the opening of the registration for the
=22M87 Workshop: Towards the 100th Anniversary of the Discovery of Cosmic=

Jets=22. We would appreciate if you share this information with intereste=
d
friends and colleagues. Apologies if you have received multiple copies
of this announcement.

Best regards,

=46IRST CIRCULAR

In 1918, H.D. Curtis of the Lick Observatory discovered the 1st =22cosmic=

jet=22 in the nucleus of the nearby active radio galaxy Messier 87
(M87). During the last four decades, the structure and dynamics of the
M87 jet have been extensively studied from 10 to 10=5E7 Schwarzschild rad=
ii
in broadband (from radio through to optical and X-ray) wavelengths. The
jet exhibits superluminal motions, indicating an acceleration of bulk
flows up to relativistic speeds in the parabolic stream, and travels
well beyond the physical extent of its host galaxy as seen in
observations.

X-ray observations toward M87 reveal that expanding lobes interact with
the interstellar medium (ISM), indicating radio-mode AGN feedback is
acting in the central cooling core of the host elliptical galaxy. We
presumably observe a site of co-evolution between the central
supermassive black hole (SMBH) and its host galaxy. Hot X-ray gases at
around the Bondi radius tell us the nature of radiatively inefficient
accretion flows, which are also explored by recent sub-mm polarimetry
observations. Very high energy emissions from M87 are often observed in
pre- and current-=46ermi era and several ideas for locating gamma-ray
flares have been suggested; near the black hole magnetosphere and/or at
the far distant place of the HST-1 complex.

One of the most exciting issues in advancing astronomy for the coming
decade is to prove the existence of black holes through direct evidence
using sub-mm VLBI observations. The combination of an extremely massive
black hole in a range of three to six billion solar masses and its
proximity to Earth has lead to a special interest with M87 in this
regard. Under the international collaboration with SAO, MIT Haystack
observatory, and NRAO, the Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy &
Astrophysics (ASIAA) is now conducting the Greenland telescope (GLT)
project to image the shadow of the SMBH in M87 with a few tens of micro
arcsecond resolution. Several key elements to understand the AGN central
engine in M87, such as the innermost jet and black hole accretion flows
on the scale of the event horizon, will also be unveiled by the
GLT. Thus, M87 has been providing numerous interesting topics to
astronomers during the last century and will continue to do so this
century.

The 4.5-day workshop (with a half day excursion) will be hosted by
ASIAA. The last meeting on M87, entitled =22The Radio Galaxy Messier 87=22=
,
was held at Ringberg, Germany in 1997. During the last two decades, we
have learned more exciting topics about M87. Therefore, this is a good
time to discuss M87 again with the deeper understandings we have gleaned
during the last two decades. We have contacted a wide range of experts
in related fields to get their support for organizing this meeting and
have been collecting supportive replies from SOC members who will guide
the direction of this workshop. It will provide a great opportunity to
enhance active interactions among local and oversea astronomers, as well
as stimulating students and young researchers in various fields.


- Topics

M 87, one of the most popular sources in nearby radio loud AGNs, will be
extensively discussed from the black hole to galactic scales. We also
expand our topics towards future sub-mm VLBI observations of the central
engine of M87, our galactic center Sgr A*, and other nearby
low-luminosity AGNs (LLAGNs). Therefore, we expect a broad interest from
the large communities in both theory and observations from radio to
gamma-ray bands.

1. Supermassive black holes;
   the mass, the spin, and direct imaging of their silhouette

2. Black hole accretions;
   from the Bondi radius to the event horizon scale

3. Black hole jets;
   from the event horizon to the galactic scale

4. High energy emissions;
   their sites and mechanisms

5. Evolution of galaxy and black hole;
   the AGN feedback

We are now accepting abstracts for oral and poster presentations.
Around 40 contributed talks will be selected on the basis of the
submitted abstracts. We also organize poster sessions during the welcome
reception on the 1st day and daily afternoon coffee/tea break from the
2nd to 4th days in order to stimulate interactions between attendees.


- Registration

There will be a registration fee, NT=245,000 (roughly equivalent to
US=24150), which covers lunch boxes, the welcome reception (on the 1st da=
y
evening), coffee/snacks for breaks, and the meeting banquet (on the 3rd
day evening). Please pay cash in NT dollars at the on-site registration
desk on your 1st day of workshop. We do not accept checks or credit
cards. Please note that registration will close on =46eb. 15 (or when we
reach the maximum of 130 attendees).


- Venue & Accommodations

Our workshop will be held at ASIAA in the 1=46 auditorium, AS/NTU
Astronomy-Mathematics Building, located on the campus of the National
Taiwan University (NTU) in Taipei. The LOC will provide assistance to
book a room at the Howard International House, the nearest hotel to
ASIAA (at less than 10 min walking distance), at a group discount
rate. The vacancies are limited so please book a room as soon as
possible (for details, please visit the workshop website).


- Excursion

Dear Astronomers in Taiwan,

Regarding our recent posing on the M87 workshop 2016, we have an additional note;
no registration fee is required for students (universities in Taiwan).

All of the local students, who are interested in the high energy
astrophysics in AGNs, are very welcome to join.

We invite four internationally renowned high energy astrophysicists, who
will give keynote presentations. They have led the fields of the black hole,
accretion flows, jets, and the AGN-galaxy co-evolution during last decades.

Don't miss this very rare chance to see them in Taiwan!

Cheers,

Masa
