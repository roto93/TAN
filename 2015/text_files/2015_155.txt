> Dear JCMT user,
>
> The East Asian Observatory is happy to invite PI observing proposals for semester 16A at JCMT. We are launching this Call through a new proposal handling system: Hedwig. You can reach Hedwig and find complete details of this Call at:
>
> https://proposals.eaobservatory.org/
>
> At your first visit, you should go to 'Log in' and generate an account.
>
> We hope you will find Hedwig easy to use: there is a 'Help' facility at the upper right corner, and individual Help tags at many places on the proposal pages.
>
> The 16A Call for Proposals closes on the 22nd of September, 2015.
>
> In addition, it should be noted that we will embark on survey observing in the 16A semester - and as such, PI time is more limited than the current semester, however we still strongly encourage PI submissions as at least 800 hours of time will be available to EAO and partner region investigators. Some alterations have also been made to the PI eligibility for Canada - please see the Call for details.
>
> We will close the old Northstar proposal handler soon: if you have information on Northstar that you value, please retrieve it now.
