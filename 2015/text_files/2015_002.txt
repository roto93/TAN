Topic:         A New Model to Predict Weak Lensing Peak Counts
Time:         1/6 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
Weak lensing has been shown to be a powerful tool for cosmology. In this talk, I will present a new model to study weak-lensing peaks, which contain rich non-Gaussian information. Based on a probabilistic approach, our model performs "fast simulations" to predict peak counts. This is based on two hypotheses: first, unbound and diffuse matter contributes little to peak abundance, and second, halo spatial correlation has a minor influence. The prediction carried out by our model is in a good agreement with N-body simulations, whereas the computation time has time largely reduced. I will highlight that our model can discriminate between various combinations of cosmological parameters, and that its high flexibility makes the use of peak counts under realistic survey conditions feasible.

Topic:         PAndromeda - a dedicated M31 survey with Pan-STARRS 1
Time:         1/7 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
The 3-year, high-cadence PS1 Andromeda survey yields well-sampled light curves that improve our understanding of microlensing and variables in M31. As a preliminary study, we discover 6 microlensing events in the inner bulge of M31. This demonstrates that deep data with good temporal resolution are essential to reveal microlensing events. We also explore the data for variability studies, and produce catalogs of ~300 eclipsing binaries, ~2000 Cepheids and other variables. We select bright eclipsing binaries for spectroscopic follow-up, to obtain a direct distance estimate of M31. We astromatrically align the multi-band Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) data to our PS1 images, and derive precise period-luminosity relation (PLR) for the Cepheids. The accurate distance and precise PLR will render M31 a distance anchor and help to reduce the error budget of Hubble constant. To fully exploit the value of PAndromeda, we welcome external collaborators, and can provide PS1
  light curves with linked HST photometry upon request.

Topic:         Ten years of Swift: The Third Swift Burst Alert Telescope Gamma-Ray Burst Catalog
Time:         1/8 (Thursday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are one of the most energetic explosions in the universe, and can be observed across a wide range of wavelengths (from radio to GeV). Therefore, GRBs provide a rich environment to study astrophysics and a unique probe of cosmology, particularly the early universe. Swift, a multi-wavelength telescope dedicated to GRB study, marks its 10-year anniversary on Nov. 20, 2014. To date, Swift has discovered ~ 920 GRBs, within which ~ 315 GRBs have redshift measurements, ranging from z=0.03 to z=9.38. Here we focus on the Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) onboard Swift, the instrument that is responsible for triggering GRB detections. We present summaries of the BAT-detected GRBs for the past ten years, including temporal and spectral analyses of prompt emission and rest-frame properties. In addition, we perform searches for GRB emission beyond the event data (conventional data range for GRB analyses) using the BAT survey data, and report a list of GRBs with confirme
d extended emission.

Topic:         Sub-stellar fragmentation induced by a phase transition: theory and simulations
Time:         1/8 (Thursday) 13:30 - 14:30
Place:         R1108
Abstract:
The problem of gravitational instability and fragmentation in the
presence of a phase transition is addressed.  The motivation is coming from
the evidences of numerous ices of volatile molecules in the cold ISM, and
especially that the conditions for H2 turning to ice are not very far in
the coldest conditions.  A simple theory based on the virial theorem
allows to guide molecular dynamics type particle simulations where gravity is
combined.
