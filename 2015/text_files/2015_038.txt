Title: Near-Infrared Imaging Observations of Transitional Disks in the
Subaru/SEEDS project

Abstract: SEEDS is a strategic project in the Subaru telescope
exploring exoplanets and circumstellar disks around 500 stars in the
near-infrared wavelengths. The project has started in 2009 and will be
completed in this year. Here, we review the project and summarize the
major results especially in the survey of protoplanetary disks by
near-infrared polarimetric imaging. In observing protoplanetary disks,
we mainly focus on transitional disks known as a protoplanetary disk
with a cavity in a central region of a disk. Disk-planet interaction
would be one of intriguing interpretations potentially responsible for
such a cavity-stracture. Thus, transitional disks would be unique
samples for understanding planet formation in a disk. As results of
tens of observations in transitional disks, we have resolved fine
structures in disks such as spirals, gaps, and dips at a radius of
tens AU possibly due to gravitational interactions with unseen
planet(s). These results may support planet formation at a wide orbit,
e.g., GJ 504 b at 43 AU. We also found differences in structures of a
cavity observed in the near-infrared and (sub-)millimeter wavelengths,
i.e., a clear cavity in (sub-)millimeter wavelengths while no cavity
in near-infrared wavelengths. The different behavior between small
(sub-micron size) and large (millimeter size) dust grains would be
consistent with disk-planet interaction plus dust filtration. Finally,
we mention our preliminary results of disk demographics in
transitional disks based on SEEDS data.
