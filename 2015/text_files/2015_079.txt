Title:Nuclear Gas Dynamics in Luminous Infrared Galaxies

Abstract:
Gas-rich galaxy mergers provide a means to funnel gas into the central
region of the system, consequently triggering episodes of nuclear star
formation and supermassive black holes growth. The details of the fueling
and feedback are often obscured by the cocooning dust stirred up from the
violent interaction. To probe the small-scale gas kinematics in the inner
kiloparsec region of these local luminous infrared galaxies requires high
spatial resolution observations of their nuclei. Here I present results
from our Keck Adaptive Optics near-infrared integral-field survey of the
nuclear regions in 17 late-stage galaxy mergers. Our findings characterized
and addressed the nature of nuclear disks, outflows driven by AGN and
starbursts, as well as the role of mergers in black hole-galaxy bulge
scaling relations. Our observations further enabled several case studies
showing direct evidence of biconical molecular outflows as well as shocked
gas from winds and ISM collision between progenitor galaxies.
