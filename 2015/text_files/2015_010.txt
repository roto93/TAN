Dear colleagues,

    The East Asian Observatory will take over the operation of JCMT from February 1st, 2015. Augmenting the international workshops held at Imperial College London and at NAOJ for the preparation of JCMT science, a local JCMT workshop in Taiwan will be held on January 23-24 at ASIAA.

    The aim of this workshop is for the potential JCMT users in Taiwan to get familiar with the latest telescope information including its operation and instrumentation status and to review the science highlights from previous or ongoing JCMT observations as well as to discuss future (PI- and/or legacy-based) projects. Hands-on sessions for proposal preparation and submission as well as data archive, access, and reduction will be conducted. A tentative schedule is enclosed at the end of this announcement. Information about pre-installation of software on your laptops/computers for the tutorial session will be circulated soon.

    Three scientists from JCMT (Jessica Dempsey, Per Friberg, Harriet Parson) and Gary Fuller from U. of Manchester will be visiting and participating the workshop. 

    Most importantly, contributions from local participants about science proposals are solicited. If you have ideas for projects, you are strongly encouraged to share it with a short presentation in the workshop for discussions and collaborations!

    Please register at the website and let me know if you would like to contribute a presentation. Thanks very much for your attention.
