Speaker:     Yu-Yen Chang (CEA-Saclay)
Topic:          AGN, star formation, and galaxy morphology
Time:          8/3 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
I will talk about the connection among activity of nuclear accretion, star formation, and galaxy morphology. In our work, we focus on mid-infrared power-law emission selected AGNs, which are complementary samples of X-ray selected AGNs. We fit optical to far-infrared photometry by the latest SED techniques to derive stellar masses, star formation rates, dust properties, and AGN contribution in the COSMOS field. We also explore galaxy morphologies through ACS and WFC3 images, which provide structural properties of galaxy stellar component at high redshift. We compare AGN host galaxies with other star-forming galaxies and discuss the effect of nuclear activity on galaxy structures and their evolution.

Topic:          The Great Observatories All-sky LIRG Survey: A VLA and Herschel View
Time:          8/5 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Luminous Infrared Galaxies (LIRGs) are observed primarily to be interacting and merging galaxies. They are the sites of rampant star formation and active galactic nuclei (AGN) which are fed by abundant supplies of molecular gas. However, the very property that led to their initial discovery by IRAS as a significant galaxy population - their high infrared luminosity - also makes them difficult to study; the majority of the UV and optical light from young, massive stars and AGN is absorbed by obscuring dust and re-emitted in the infrared. The Great Observatories All-sky LIRGs Survey thus makes use of the diversity in wavelength coverage of the present space-based telescopes to probe the activity in a large (~ 100 - 200), flux-limited sample of LIRGs from the Revised Bright Galaxy Sample (RBGS). The first part of the talk will be devoted to discussing the survey as a whole. The latter part of the talk will be focussed on how our VLA and Herschel Space Observatory surveys are he!
