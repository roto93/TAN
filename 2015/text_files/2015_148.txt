Speaker:     Yu-Yen Chang (CEA-Saclay)
Topic:          AGN, star formation, and galaxy morphology
Time:          8/3 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
I will talk about the connection among activity of nuclear accretion, star formation, and galaxy morphology. In our work, we focus on mid-infrared power-law emission selected AGNs, which are complementary samples of X-ray selected AGNs. We fit optical to far-infrared photometry by the latest SED techniques to derive stellar masses, star formation rates, dust properties, and AGN contribution in the COSMOS field. We also explore galaxy morphologies through ACS and WFC3 images, which provide structural properties of galaxy stellar component at high redshift. We compare AGN host galaxies with other star-forming galaxies and discuss the effect of nuclear activity on galaxy structures and their evolution.

Topic:          The Great Observatories All-sky LIRG Survey: A VLA and Herschel View
Time:          8/5 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Luminous Infrared Galaxies (LIRGs) are observed primarily to be interacting and merging galaxies. They are the sites of rampant star formation and active galactic nuclei (AGN) which are fed by abundant supplies of molecular gas. However, the very property that led to their initial discovery by IRAS as a significant galaxy population - their high infrared luminosity - also makes them difficult to study; the majority of the UV and optical light from young, massive stars and AGN is absorbed by obscuring dust and re-emitted in the infrared. The Great Observatories All-sky LIRGs Survey thus makes use of the diversity in wavelength coverage of the present space-based telescopes to probe the activity in a large (~ 100 - 200), flux-limited sample of LIRGs from the Revised Bright Galaxy Sample (RBGS). The first part of the talk will be devoted to discussing the survey as a whole. The latter part of the talk will be focussed on how our VLA and Herschel Space Observatory surveys are he!

Topic:          The Structure of Class 0 Protostars: BHR71 in Herschel View
Time:           8/10 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
We performed a comprehensive analysis of the Herschel spectra of BHR71,
an embedded Class 0 protostar. We recover 66 lines in the central
spaxel, and more than 700 lines are detected in all spaxels in PACS, and
SPIRE. The CO rotational diagram analysis shows four excitation
temperature components, 51 K, 153 K, 408 K, and 1053 K. Low-J CO lines
trace the outflow while the high-J CO lines are centered on the infrared
source.  The emissions of H2O traces the outflow on large scales, while
H2O emissions populate along the equatorial plane on small scale scales.
We model the structure of envelope using dust radiative transfer with
Hyperion to fit the spectral energy distribution (SED) observed by
Spitzer and Herschel.  The model incorporates rotational collapse and an
outer static envelope as well as outflow cavity and disk.  Our
exploration of parameter space shows that the evolution of collapsing
envelope can be constrained by Herschel spectra and the structure of
outflow cavity plays a critical role in the shorter wavelength.  We
found the density profile of cavity with a power law with a constant
inner region can reproduce the observations.  The high central
luminosity in the best-fit model shows a hint of a higher accretion rate
than the rate derived from collapse model.  Our model constrains BHR71
to have an age of 29000 years and a total dust mass of 0.04 Solar mass.
