The Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) is the largest ground based astronomical project ever carried out. Led by a worldwide consortium, this new generation telescope will entitle us to unveil the origin of our Universe as well as the origin of Life.

The University Consortium of ALMA-Taiwan (UCAT) is embarking to this unprecedented project and is inviting students to apply to the UCAT Summer Student program, where they will have the opportunity to lead unique groundbreaking research under the guidance of astronomers. Opportunity is open to about 10 students with preference given to the junior level or higher, and who are majoring in any scientific topic (physics, mathematics, chemistry, computer science, engineering, and of course astronomy).

Students will attend a series of lecture designed for them in the Summer School, to introduce them to ALMA, Radio-astronomy, and the different possible subjects of research. Also, all students are required to give an oral report of their research projects at the conclusion of the program, and to provide a written report suitable for the WEB.

The successful candidates will work at UCAT member universities from 2015 July 01 (Wed) to August 28 (Fri). The salary will be NT$20,000 per month. A brief description of the research projects offered can be found on the website (http://ucat.es.ntnu.edu.tw/tuCASA/USSP2015/ ).  USSP2015 Program poster can be downloaded at http://ucat.es.ntnu.edu.tw/tuCASA/USSP2015/USSP2015_poster_A4.pdf )
