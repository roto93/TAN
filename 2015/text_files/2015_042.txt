Speaker:    Paulo Freire (Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy)
Topic:         Testing general relativity and alternative theories of gravity with binary pulsars
Time:         2/24 (Tuesday) 15:20 - 16:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
The last decade has witnessed a revolution in tests of general relativity using binary pulsars. First, the discovery of the "double pulsar", PSR J0737-3039, has greatly improved the quality (and quantity) of tests of general relativity possible with double neutron star systems. In particular, it has greatly improved the famous test of the emission of gravitational waves, which was originally carried out with the Hulse-Taylor binary pulsar, PSR B1913+16. In this talk I review some of the basics on pulsars and neutron stars, discuss the basics of pulsar timing and discuss in detail these classical tests and their  results, with a particular emphasis on the upcoming results from the double pulsar.
    Second, the discovery of several tight binary millisecond pulsar systems with optically bright white dwarf companions like PSR J1738+0333 and PSR J0348+0432 has allowed extremely constraining tests of alternative theories of gravity from the combination of radio pulsar timing and optical spectroscopy of the white dwarf companion. In this talk I discuss this new technique and present some of the results, their constraints on alternative theories of gravity, and future prospects for improvements. If time allows, I will also mention some of the constraints on violations of the local Lorenz invariance of gravity.
    In the last part of the talk I discuss future and more powerful tests of GR with pulsars. The first one is a test of the strong equivalence principle (SEP) using the new millisecond pulsar in a triple star system, PSR J0337+1715. The second is a very precise test of the no-hair theorem for black holes with a hypothetical pulsar orbiting the super-massive black hole at the center of our Galaxy.

Topic:         Planet Formation 2.0 - From Planetesimals to Planets
Time:         2/25 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
Models of each stage of planet growth have mostly been successful at identifying the important physics in different regions of space at different times. The earliest stages are dominated by small-body physics, where sub-km-size bodies collide with each other and also interact with the gaseous solar nebula. Later, the gravitational interaction between planetary
embryos on long timescales becomes more important. However, splitting the problem into different stages, each modeling subsets of the total physics, has an inherit weakness - planet growth does not progress at the same speed at all locations. Rather the inner regions of the Solar System may have many gravitationally interacting planetary embryos, while outer regions are still dominated by small-body collisions. Indeed, it has been recently shown that performing these simulations in a piecemeal way can lead us to fundamentally wrong conclusions about how the planets formed.

Here we present simulations of planet formation from km-sized planetesimals all the way to planets. Using a particle-based code that models the fragmentation, accretion and dynamical evolution of a large number of planetesimals through the entire growth process we avoid the pitfalls of the classical piece-wise approaches. We generally find growth timescales that are far more dependent on distance from the Sun than previously expected. This leads to giant collisions between planetary embryos at 1 AU before Ceres-sized embryos have formed beyond 2 AU. We use these results to test classical models of Terrestrial Planet formation, including the recent Grand Tack model.

Title: Near-Infrared Imaging Observations of Transitional Disks in the
Subaru/SEEDS project

Abstract: SEEDS is a strategic project in the Subaru telescope
exploring exoplanets and circumstellar disks around 500 stars in the
near-infrared wavelengths. The project has started in 2009 and will be
completed in this year. Here, we review the project and summarize the
major results especially in the survey of protoplanetary disks by
near-infrared polarimetric imaging. In observing protoplanetary disks,
we mainly focus on transitional disks known as a protoplanetary disk
with a cavity in a central region of a disk. Disk-planet interaction
would be one of intriguing interpretations potentially responsible for
such a cavity-stracture. Thus, transitional disks would be unique
samples for understanding planet formation in a disk. As results of
tens of observations in transitional disks, we have resolved fine
structures in disks such as spirals, gaps, and dips at a radius of
tens AU possibly due to gravitational interactions with unseen
planet(s). These results may support planet formation at a wide orbit,
e.g., GJ 504 b at 43 AU. We also found differences in structures of a
cavity observed in the near-infrared and (sub-)millimeter wavelengths,
i.e., a clear cavity in (sub-)millimeter wavelengths while no cavity
in near-infrared wavelengths. The different behavior between small
(sub-micron size) and large (millimeter size) dust grains would be
consistent with disk-planet interaction plus dust filtration. Finally,
we mention our preliminary results of disk demographics in
transitional disks based on SEEDS data.

<Scientific Rationale>

The Cosmic Distance Scale plays a fundamental role in a broad range of
topics in astronomy. This is because it is not easy to know distances
to astronomical objects and yet the distances are important to study
many characteristics of the objects, such as their luminosities and
masses, sizes and ages. An accurate distance scale is also required to
reconstruct the structure and evolution of the Universe itself.
Continuing efforts have been made to develop the Cosmic Distance Scale
ever since very early pioneering works such as the first measurements
of trigonometric parallaxes in the 19th Century and the discovery of
the period-luminosity relation of Cepheids around a hundred years ago.
There have been great advances in the recent decades; for example,
supernova distance measurments enabled us to discover the accelerating
expansion of the Universe. On the other hand, accurate measurements of
the cosmic background radiation made it possible to study the
structure and evolution of the Universe, which is one of the main
goals to establish the Cosmic Distance Scale.

An important aspect in measuring astronomical distances is that no
single method can be used for the entire range from the proximity
within the solar system to the distant Universe. Therefore, it is
important to keep the methods well-calibrated step-by-step from the
starting point based on trigonometric parallax. In this context, this
is a very exciting time because the Gaia will provide unprecedented
measurements of parallaxes in the very near future, which will have a
large impact on the entire range of the Cosmic Distance Scale. There
are also high-impact projects ongoing and planned, which will deliver
new insights into the structure of the Universe including several
projects led by Japan such as JASMINE, VERA, and, SuMIRe. While recent
developements of observational facilities and techniques have made it
feasible to measure distances to objects across the entire range of
the Universe, recent achievements have demonstrated that it is
important to make the distance indicators both precise and robust.
Such recent developements require us to understand the accuracy, range
of application, and limits to each method and how it is related to
other methods.

In this school, distinguished experts in various fields will give
lectures on the basic principles of the methods to the expected
progress in the near future. It will be a good opportunity to share a
broad perspective on the Cosmic Distance Scale among young astronomers
who will play an active role in a wide range of astronomy. The Cosmic
Distance Scale indeed covers various fields of astronomy which are
related to one another, and this school will also offer a chance to
spend time with international young astronomers working in different
subfields.

Title: Progenitors of core-collapse supernovae: what we know, what we
think we know and what do we not know.
Abstract: The last 15 years has seen a dramatic increase in our
knowledge of the stars that explode in core-collapse supernovae. Prior
to this only two stars had been identified in pre-explosion images as
the stars that gave rise to a supernovae. Today this number is
approaching detections or constraints for 50 supernovae and we can
start understanding the population of stars that explode in greater
detail. While we know for certain that the progenitors of type IIP
supernovae are red supergiants there is still much confusion over the
remaining supernova types. Most worrying of all we have not detected a
progenitor with an initial mass greater than 20 Solar Masses which has
implications for how stars explode.
