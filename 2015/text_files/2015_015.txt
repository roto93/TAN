Arizona Radio Observatory: Call for Proposals (Spring 2015)
------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Astronomers in Taiwan,

Observing proposals from members of the University Consortium of ALMA-Taiwan
(UCAT) and ASIAA for the 10-meter Submillimeter Telescope (SMT), located on
Mount Graham, Arizona, of the Arizona Radio Observatory (ARO) are being
solicited for the period February 15, 2015 to June 15, 2015. Proposals will
also be accepted on a limited shared-risk basis for the new ALMA Prototype
12-meter Telescope (12m) located on Kitt Peak, Arizona. The proposal deadline
of UCAT/ASIAA for this 2015 spring semester is set on February 06, 2015 (Fri).

The SMT currently supports a dual-polarization, 1-mm (211-275 GHz) receiver
with ALMA Band 6 sideband-separating (SBS) mixers, a dual-polarization 0.8-mm
(320-370 GHz) receiver, a dual-polarization 0.7 mm (420-500 GHz) SIS receiver
with SBS mixers, and a 0.4-mm (602-720 GHz) dual-polarization receiver with
ALMA Band 9 mixers. The SMT control system supports both dual-polarization
("2 IF mode"), and dual-polarization, dual-sideband observations ("4 IF mode"),
as well as OTF mapping. The new 12m will support ALMA Band 3 dual-polarization
SBS receiver (84-116 GHz) for this season.

Remote observing is available. Observers who plan to observe remotely must
supply fixed IP address(es) of the computer(s) that will be used during
observing on their Proposal Summary Sheet. Information about Remote Observing
can be viewed at: http://aro.as.arizona.edu/remote/remote.htm/. Graduate student
participation is especially encouraged. For further information about remote
observing and operational questions, please contact Tom Folkers, Operations
Manager at tfolkers@email.arizona.edu .

Proposers should consult the ARO website, http://aro.as.arizona.edu/, for
technical specifications and to download updated Proposal Summary Sheet 
templates here: http://aro.as.arizona.edu/proposal_submission_information.htm .
Proposal candidates are required to list on the Proposal Summary Sheet their
requested observing blocks (LST ranges), dates on which they are NOT available
to observe, and dates in which sources in those observing blocks are within the
Sun-avoidance zone (44 degrees at the SMT).

Proposals should consist of:
1.  A Proposal Summary Sheet.
2.  A brief scientific and technical justification (no more than 2 pages).
3.  A source list with observing time requirements and justification, and/or
    tables, figures and references (no more than 1 page in total).

Dear Dr. Kuan, 

I am writing to you about a small workshop 'Icy Grain Chemistry for Formation
of Complex Organic Molecules: From Molecular Clouds to Protoplanetary Disks,
Comets and Meteorite' which will be held in Tokyo Tech. during 5-7 March.

Please have a look at the attached announcement and the workshop web site for
the details. If you could kindly help us to circulate the announcement to those
who may be interested in the workshop, I shall very much appreciate it!

Thank you very much for your kind consideration. 


Best wishes,

"Icy Grain Chemistry for Formation of Complex Organic Molecules: 
From Molecular Clouds to Protoplanetary Disks, Comets and Meteorites" 
March 5 - 7, 2015 at Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan 
http://www.geo.titech.ac.jp/lab/nomura/grain_chem/index.html 

*Abstract Submission Deadline : January 30, 2015* 

Thanks to development of infrared and mm/submm instruments, more than 
170 molecules have been detected in the interstellar medium (ISM). 
Complexity of the detected molecules is increasing, and now ALMA 
(Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array) is challenging to detect 
amino acids in the ISM. On the other hand, amino acids have been discovered 
in comets and meteorites in our Solar System, and it is an open question 
how the complex organic molecules in our Solar System have been formed 
from the molecules found in the ISM. 

Formation processes of complex organic molecules in space are not 
understood very well, but grain surface chemistry is thought to play 
an important role. Modelling grain surface chemistry has been developed 
for decades, but it still contains many uncertainties due to difficulty 
in laboratory experiments and theoretical calculations. 

In this workshop we would like to discuss how we can develop chemical 
reaction network of grain surface reactions/icy mantle reactions based 
on laboratory experiments and theoretical calculations of basic processes. 
We aim to understand formation processes of complex organic molecules/ 
prebiotic molecules found in comets and meteorites through chemical 
reactions in protoplanetary disks and molecular clouds. 

We look forward to fruitful discussions with participants working on 
laboratory experiments, theoretical calculations of basic processes 
and chemical reaction network, astronomical observations of complex 
organic molecules, and wide range of fields.

Dear colleagues,

    The East Asian Observatory will take over the operation of JCMT from February 1st, 2015. Augmenting the international workshops held at Imperial College London and at NAOJ for the preparation of JCMT science, a local JCMT workshop in Taiwan will be held on January 23-24 at ASIAA.

    The aim of this workshop is for the potential JCMT users in Taiwan to get familiar with the latest telescope information including its operation and instrumentation status and to review the science highlights from previous or ongoing JCMT observations as well as to discuss future (PI- and/or legacy-based) projects. Hands-on sessions for proposal preparation and submission as well as data archive, access, and reduction will be conducted. A tentative schedule is enclosed at the end of this announcement. Information about pre-installation of software on your laptops/computers for the tutorial session will be circulated soon.

    Three scientists from JCMT (Jessica Dempsey, Per Friberg, Harriet Parson) and Gary Fuller from U. of Manchester will be visiting and participating the workshop. 

    Most importantly, contributions from local participants about science proposals are solicited. If you have ideas for projects, you are strongly encouraged to share it with a short presentation in the workshop for discussions and collaborations!

    Please register at the website and let me know if you would like to contribute a presentation. Thanks very much for your attention.

Dear Potential ALMA users,

  Here is an announcement that ARC-Taiwan ALMA Archive is now available at the following link:
    
    http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/~kswang/ALMA/index.html

  ARC-Taiwan ALMA Archive - a website providing preview images and spectra of ALMA archival data

  Using the official ALMA archive system, we have built up an ARC-Taiwan ALMA archive with enhanced functions. Unlike the official archive which provides calibrated visibilities only, we provide direct images and spectra of the data. Our ALMA archive categorizes the data into five research fields which ALMA defines for proposal submission. There are 117 cycle 0 projects in the official ALMA archive and we have processed 46 projects (as of 2015-01-13) which are ready to be explored for archival science. Cycle 1 and future cycle data will also be included once released. People are strongly encouraged to surf the website if you want to do ALMA science from now (archive science) and in the future (cycle 3+ proposal submission). Comments, suggestions, and questions are welcome.

Best Wishes,
Chin-Fei
On behalf of Taiwan ARC node

Speaker:    Chuan-Chin Lai (ASIAA)
Topic:         Can We Measure Galaxy Environments with Photometric Redshifts?
Time:         1/19 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
A variety of methods have been proposed to define and to quantify galaxy environments. While these techniques work well in general with spectroscopic redshift samples, their application to photometric redshift surveys remains uncertain. To investigate whether galaxy environments can be robustly measured with photo-z samples, we quantify how the density measured with the nearest neighbor approach is affected by photo-z uncertainties by using the Durham mock catalogs in which the 3D real-space environments and the properties of galaxies are exactly known. Furthermore, we present an optimization scheme in the choice of parameters used in the 2D projected measurements which yields the tightest correlation with respect to the 3D real-space environments. By adopting the parameters in the density measurements, we show that the correlation between the 2D projected optimized density and real-space density can still be revealed, and the color-density relation is also visible even for !
a photo-z uncertainty (Ïƒâˆ†z/(1+z)) up to 0.06. We find that a deep (i âˆ¼ 25) photometric redshift survey with Ïƒâˆ†z/(1+z) = 0.02 yields a comparable performance of density measurement to a shallower i âˆ¼ 22.5 (24.1) spectroscopic sample with 40% (20%) sampling rate. Finally, we discuss the application of the local density measurements to the Pan-STARRS Medium Deep survey, one of the largest on-going deep imaging surveys. Using data from âˆ¼ 5deg2 of survey area, our results show that it is possible to measure local density and to probe the color-density relation in the PS-MDS, confirming the simulation results. The color-density relation, however, quickly degrades for data covering smaller areas.


*** Colloquium ***

Speaker:    David Spergel (Princeton University)
Topic:         Searching for Gravitational Waves in the Microwave Background
Time:         1/21 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
The detection of gravitational waves from the early universe would have a profound impact on our understanding of the early universe and would have
an important implications for our understanding of fundamental physics.  The BICEP2 team recently claimed to have made the first detection of gravitational waves.  I will suggest that polarized dust is a more likely explanation and discuss the recent results from the Planck satellite.  I will then look forward to upcoming experiments that will use multi-wavelength data to search for gravitational waves.
