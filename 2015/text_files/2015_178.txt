*******************************************
Call for Proposals 2016A (KVN VLBI)
*******************************************

Dear colleagues,

The Korean VLBI Network (KVN, http://kvn.kasi.re.kr/) invites scientific
proposals
for VLBI observations during the 2016A season from Astronomers over the
world.
Observations of successful proposals will be scheduled between 15th January
2016 and 15th June 2016.
Proposals should be emailed to kvnprop@kasi.re.kr before the deadline of UT
08:00 (KST17:00)
on 2nd November 2015.

Korean VLBI Network (KVN)

The Korean VLBI Network (KVN) is a dedicated mm-VLBI network,
operated by Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute (KASI,
http://www.kasi.re.kr).
Its three 21m radio telescopes are located in Seoul, Ulsan and Jeju Island
around South Korea.
The baseline lengths ranges from 305km to 476 km. Its 4-channel receiving
system allows
simultaneous observation at 22, 43, 86, and 129 GHz. For 2016A season, 22,
43, and 86 GHz are available.
Risk-share Observation at 129 GHz is available. Total machine time of 300
hours are planned for this call.
The maximum observation time of a proposal will be limited to 100 hours. If
requested in the proposals,
the observation time can be allocated over a year, until January 15, 2017,
for this call.
But the maximum observation time will be NOT increased.
Details of the information and current status of the KVN can be found in
the KVN VLBI Status Report
(http://kvn.kasi.re.kr/status_report_2014/).
Proposer should fill the KVN VLBI proposal form (tex file can be found
at http://kvn.kasi.re.kr/index.html/obs_proposal.php). Please carefully
follow
the instruction of the proposal form. A separate scientific and technical
justification is mandatory.
This Justification should be submitted together with the proposal form and
not exceed 3 pages.
