Topic:          Disk meeting in Cyprus
Time:           9/7 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Planet formation in protoplanetary disks is a fast-paced field. I will summarize a few interesting results I heard recently from the disk meeting held on the historic island of Cyprus.


*** Colloquium ***

Speaker:        Hsi-Yu Schive (NTU)
Topic:          ΨDM vs. CDM: from Local Dwarf Galaxies to High-z Luminosity Functions
Time:           9/9 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
The newly established luminosity functions (LFs) of high-z galaxies at z ~ 4 - 10 can provide a stringent check on dark matter models that aim to explain the core properties of dwarf galaxies. The cores of dwarf spheroidal galaxies are understood to be too large to be accounted for by free streaming of warm dark matter without overly suppressing the formation of such galaxies. In this talk, I will show from cosmological simulations that wave dark matter, ΨDM, appropriate for light bosons such as axions, does not suffer this problem, given a boson mass of m ~ 10^{-22} eV. The large-scale structure of ΨDM is indistinguishable from cold dark matter (CDM), as desired, but differs radically inside galaxies where quantum interference forms solitonic cores surrounded by extended halos of fluctuating density granules. The halo mass function is suppressed below ~ 10^10 M⊙ at a level that is consistent with the observed high-z LFs and the Thomson optical depth recently reported by!
  Planck. Moreover, ΨDM predicts that the LFs should turn over slowly around an intrinsic UV luminosity of M_UV ≥ -16 at z ≥ 4, distinctly different from CDM. We also show that for galaxies magnified >10x in the Hubble Frontier Fields, ΨDM predicts an order of magnitude fewer detections than CDM at z ~ 10 down to M_UV ~ -15, allowing us to distinguish between these very different interpretations for the observed coldness of dark matter.

*NCU-Delta Young Astronomer Lectureship Award Lecture*

Speaker: Dr. Kevin Heng (Center for Space and Habitability,University of
Bern, Switzerland)
Topic: Exoplanetary Atmospheres in Eras
Time: Sep 10, 2pm
Place: S4-1013, NCU

Abstract:
The observational scrutiny of the atmospheres of exoplanets is now a
legitimate field of inquiry, which has motivated their theoretical study.
In this review talk, I will summarise and highlight the state of the art of
both observations and theory of exoplanetary atmospheres. The review is
organised into eras, starting from the birth of spectrophotometry to the
upcoming set of next-generation exoplanet hunters and characterisers. On
the observational side, I will review spectrophotometry, phase curves,
eclipse mapping, direct imaging and ultra-high-resolution spectroscopy. On
the theoretical side, I will review atmospheric radiation, chemistry and
circulation (fluid dynamics). I will discuss the problem of bright stars
and why we need the next-generation of exoplanet hunting machines (CHEOPS,
TESS and PLATO) to build up a better target list for atmospheric
characterisation. Finally, there will be a discussion of the habitable zone
and also how the conversations between the scientists from different
sub-disciplines need to be more constructive.
