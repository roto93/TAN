*NCU Astronomy Colloquium*
Speaker: Prof. Tseng Wei-Ling (NTNU)
Topic:Exploring our Solar system with Mass Spectrometry
Time: May 29, 2pm
Place: S4-1013, NCU

Abstract:
Today I'd like to talk about my research on exploring 1)the Saturnian
system, 2) Mercury's exosphere and 3) Earth's upper atmosphere with mass
spectrometry. To study the Saturn's magnetosphere, my work is focused on
the simulations of the structures and compositions of the neutral clouds of
different origins with a plasma chemistry model based on the latest
measurements from the Cassini INMS, CAPS and MIMI instruments. In addition,
I also participated in the lab design of the Strofio, which is a neutral
mass spectrometer utilizing with electron-impact ionization onboard
BepiColombo mission, to explore Mercury's exosphere. Strofio can measure
the in-situ composition of exosphere yielding the spatial distribution and
temporal variability of neutral particles. Finally, I'd like to propose
possible collaborations to conduct the in-situ measurements of the air
composition in Earth's upper atmosphere. The sample-collection package for
high altitude measurements can be set up on a variety of platforms
(i.e.,balloons). After recovering the air samples, they will be analyzed
with mass spectrometers in the ground lab to get the information of air
composition and density structures.
