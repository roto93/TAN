*NCU Astronomy Colloquium*
Speaker: Prof. Abe Shinsuke(Department of Aerospace Engineering, Nihon
University)
Topic:Orbit Determination of Meteoroids by MU Radar Meteor Head Echo
Observations
Time: Mar. 20, 2pm
Place: S4-1013, NCU

Abstract:
The various mass ranges of meteoroids ranging between 10^-15 and 10^15g are
continuously colliding with the Earth. Most of them are so called
micrometeoroids, micrometeorites or IDPs (Interplanetary Dust Particles)
whose diameters are estimated between 10 and several 100 micrometres. It is
indicated by radar, high-flying aircraft and zodiacal cloud observations
that a daily mass influx of meteoroids is ranging from 100 to 300 tones.
However, it is still a matter of finding parent bodies of most meteoroids,
while parent bodies for the most of major meteor showers have been
identified as comets or dormant comets. Their physical and chemical aspects
such as composition, structure as well as their origins are also poorly
known. The influx rate of interplanetary dusts and artificial space debris
onto the Earth's surface are essential for the human space activities.
Thus, it is very important to investigate influx, orbits and mechanical
strength of meteoroids that can be observed as meteors after interacting
with the upper atmosphere. High power large aperture (HPLA) radar
observation is a recent technique to provide useful information on meteor
influx and orbits, as well as interactions with the atmosphere. The recent
development of the technique carried out using the middle and upper
atmosphere radar (MU radar) of Kyoto University at Shigaraki (34.9N,
136.1S), which is large atmospheric VHF radar with 46.5 MHz frequency, 1 MW
output transmission power and 8330 m2 aperture array antenna, has
established very precise orbital determination from meteor head echoes.
More than 150,000 meteor orbits have been measured since 2009. In this
study, we present the physical quantities of meteoroids such as orbital
parameters, flux rate and ablation characteristics obtained from the MU
radar meteor head echo observations. The origin and internal structure of
meteoroids compared with comets, asteroids and space debris will be
discussed.

Title:An exceptionally powerful trio in the Large Magellanic Cloud

Abstract:
The Large Magellanic Cloud, a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, has
been observed with the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.)
above an energy of 100 billion electron volts for a deep exposure of
210 hours. Three sources of different types were detected: the pulsar
wind nebula of the most energetic pulsar known, N 157B; the radio-loud
supernova remnant N 132D; and the largest nonthermal x-ray shell, the
superbubble 30 Dor C. The unique object SN 1987A is, unexpectedly, not
detected, which constrains the theoretical framework of particle
acceleration in very young supernova remnants. These detections reveal
the most energetic tip of a gamma-ray source population in an external
galaxy and provide via 30 Dor C the unambiguous detection of gamma-ray
emission from a superbubble.

Dear Professors

Our conference "Exoplanet" was held successfully last April 2014 in Quy
Nhon, Vietnam.  The similar topic of this conference will be organised this
summer.  The title is "Planetary Systems: A Synergistic View".  We are very
pleased to invite you to attend this meeting.  Please find the following
link of this conference for details :

Could you please also spread out this information among your colleagues and
collaboration?

We thank you for your kind attention and look forward to meeting you in Quy
Nhon, Vietnam.

Best regards
Aimie Fong

*** Colloquium ***

Speaker:    Matteo Barnabè (University of Copenhagen)
Topic:         The dark and luminous structure of massive galaxies
Time:         3/18 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
Understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies remains among the foremost open problems in present-day astrophysics and cosmology. A reliable and detailed description of the density profile, mass budget, structural properties and stellar initial mass function of galaxies through cosmic time is a much-needed step forward but – whereas nearby systems have been subject to intense scrutiny – painfully little is known about more distant ones, since observational limitations make it challenging to employ the traditional diagnostic tools.
I will demonstrate how these difficulties can be overcome by combining the information obtained from all the available constraints: strong gravitational lensing, extended stellar kinematics and stellar population synthesis modeling. This approach makes it possible to conduct unprecedentedly detailed and robust investigations of the dark and luminous structure of massive ellipticals beyond the local Universe and, for the first time, to put strong constraints on both the steepness and the elusive lower mass cut-off of their stellar IMF. Finally, I will discuss how this joint technique can take full advantage of present and upcoming state-of-the-art instruments in order to advance our understanding of galaxy structure at higher redshifts and beyond the current mass frontier.

Meeting Announcement:

Astronomy & Astrophysics from Antarctica became a Scientific Research Program of SCAR in 2010. Broadly stated, its objectives are to coordinate astronomical activities in Antarctica in a way that ensures the best possible outcomes from international investment in Antarctic astronomy, and to maximize the opportunities for productive interaction with other disciplines. Third workshop of the SCAR AAA is to be held on August 7-10, 2015 at the Kilauea Military Camp within the Volcanoes National Park, Big-Island, State of Hawaii, in the US.
