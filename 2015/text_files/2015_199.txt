*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________
Speaker:     Joseph Mohr (Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat Munchen)
Topic:          Studies of Galaxy Clusters and Cosmology with the South Pole Telescope and the Dark Energy Survey
Time:          11/23 (Monday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
The South Pole Telescope survey of 2500 deg^2 in the southern sky has enabled the selection of a large sample of massive galaxy clusters extending to z~1.5 through their Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect.  Dark Energy Survey deep, optical multiband imaging is enabling studies of the galaxy populations within those clusters and constraints on the masses of the systems through weak lensing. Analyses of the population of SZE selected clusters from SPT indicates cosmological constraints that are in good agreement with other cosmological probes and that together with other probes provide among the most precise constraints yet on the growth rate of cosmic structure and the equation of state of the dark energy. Improved mass constraints from weak lensing and new cluster finding experiments in the X-ray through eROSITA promise to open the window on new studies of cosmology and structure evolution.

Speaker:     Olivier Dore (JPL/Caltech)
Topic:          From Planck to SPHEREx: Adding the 3rd Dimension to a Full-sky Map to Probe Inflation
Time:          11/24 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           Physics 104
Abstract:
The Planck success leaves cosmology with impressively well established questions and... few answers. Amongst them, the nature of the initial conditions that led to the large-scale structure we observe today is one of the most salient. I will briefly review Planck latest results, and motivate the need for the 3D mapping of an ultra-large volume to directly observe the nature of inflation. From a theoretical point of view, measuring the largest scales promises a powerful and clean probe of the initial conditions. The modeling of these large scales yields interesting (solvable) physics problems.  The measurement of these large scales is also feasible: I will present a proposed satellite mission, SPHEREx, that promises to accomplish such a mapping, and much more. By constructing the first all-sky near-infrared spectral survey, SPHEREx will not only constrain the physics of inflation with unprecedented accuracy but also offer new insights on the origin and history of galaxies and!

 build a spectral catalog of 100s of millions of objects for the astronomy community to use.

Speaker:     Bing-Ming Chen (National Synchrotron Center of Taiwan)
Topic:          Looking into Space with Far-UV Spectroscopy and Photochemistry
Time:          11/25 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Far-UV (FUV) spectroscopies and photochemical processes of interstellar molecules attract interest because the information yields detailed knowledge about chemical transformations in extraterrestrial environments. Synchrotron radiation (SR) provides an intense and continuous source of FUV light. The high quality of FUV from SR gives the chances for scientists to investigate the spectroscopy and photochemistry of interstellar molecule in this region. Using the FUV beam lines from the 1.5 GeV storage ring at National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (NSRRC) in Taiwan, we are currently conducting the experiments of photoabsorption, photodissociation, and photoluminescence researches applied to astro-science. Taking the advantage of  synchrotron, we explore the FUV astro-science with exciting prospects. For example, to understand the atmosphere and climate of an extraterrestrial body and their variation, a key issue is the extent of isotopic fractionation, such as D/H. A me!

chanism proposed to explain variations in isotopic fractionation on planets is called the photo-induced fractionation effect (PHIFE). The crucial idea is that the rate of photolysis differs greatly for various isotopomers/isotopologues near the absorption threshold region. To assess the potential for photochemically induced changes in stellar and upper atmosphere, we thus study the FUV absolute absorption cross sections of pertinent planetary species and their isotopomers/isotopologues. These FUV data are keys to understand the extent of isotopic fractionations in our planets.  Other examples of FUV astro-science will also be discussed in the presentation.
