Speaker:    Hiro Takami (ASIAA)
Topic:         A Subaru-HiCIAO Study of the SU Aur Disk: Clues for Tidal Tails?
Time:         5/11 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:          R1203
Abstract:
Direct images of scattered light from protoplanetary disks provide valuable information about their surface geometries, and thereby possible ongoing planet formation.  A recent 5-year survey with Subaru-HiCIAO (SEEDS) has been successful in observing diverse disk morphologies in these disks.  I present our results for the SU Aur disk, which is associated with intriguing tails not seen in other disks. These tails may be due to an encounter with an unseen brown dwarf (de Leon, Takami et al., ApJL, submitted).



*** ASIAA/NTU Joint Colloquium ***

Speaker:    Ron Taam (ASIAA)
Topic:         The Astrophysics of Stellar Mass Compact Objects
Time:         5/12 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:          physics 104
Abstract:
Current developments in the astrophysics of stellar mass compact objects will be highlighted. Recent space based and ground based observations of X-ray point sources in our Galaxy and in external galaxies have led to a resurgence of interest in these objects. A brief overview of their observational properties will be introduced and our current physical understanding described. Many of these objects are transient, exhibiting time variations in both flux and spectra.  By studying their behavior in both quiescence and in outburst, they can be used as cosmic laboratories to reveal the physics underlying their nature and state of evolution.


*** Colloquium ***

Speaker:    Nicholas Altobelli (ESA)
Topic:         Rosetta -  A Journey to our Origins
Time:         5/13 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:          R1203
Abstract:
Comets are the best sample of primitive solar nebula material presently available to us, dating back 4.57 billion years to the origin of our planetary system.

Past missions to comets have all been “fast flybys”: They provided only a snapshot view of the dust and ice nucleus, the nebulous coma surrounding it, and how the solar wind interacts with both of these components. The Rosetta mission was set for a much more ambitious challenge - to accompany a comet nucleus on its journey around the Sun, monitoring the evolution of its activity, and deploy a lander on its surface. Rosetta is an ESA mission, with contributions from member states and from NASA, and it currently orbits the Jupiter family comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (67P).

After rendezvous on August 2014, the Rosetta spacecraft moved from 100 km above the nucleus to a bound orbit only ~10 km away. This early period of the mission has revealed previously unseen details of a comet nucleus, as Rosetta's instruments recorded measurements that were once impossible. After delivering the lander on November 2014, Rosetta began the systematic characterization of the nucleus and the monitoring of its activity, using a complex trajectory pattern offering complementary observation conditions.

We review in this talk the knowledge acquired by the Rosetta mission so far.
