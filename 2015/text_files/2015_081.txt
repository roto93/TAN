*NCU Astronomy Colloquium*
Speaker: Prof. Cosimo Bambi(Fudan University, China)
Topic:Testing astrophysical black hole candidates
Time: Apr,17, 2pm
Place: S4-1013, NCU

Abstract:

Stellar-mass back hole candidates in X-ray binaries are too heavy to
be neutron stars, while supermassive black hole candidates in galactic
nuclei are too heavy, compact, and old to be clusters of neutron
stars. On this basis, both object classes are thought to be the Kerr
black hole of general relativity, but a direct observational
confirmation is still lacking. In this talk, I will discuss how the
study of the properties of the electromagnetic radiation emitted by
the gas in the accretion disk can test the Kerr nature of black hole
candidates. In particular, I will talk about the study of the thermal
spectrum of thin disks and the analysis of the iron K-alpha line. Both
the techniques can already be used to provide some constraints on
possible deviations from the Kerr solution, but more interesting tests
require new X-ray facilities with larger effective areas.
