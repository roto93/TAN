*NCU Astronomy Colloquium*
Speaker: Dr. Vivian U (University of California, Riverside, USA)
Topic:Nuclear Gas Dynamics in Luminous Infrared Galaxies
Time: May 11, 2pm
Place: S4-1013, NCU

Abstract:
Gas-rich galaxy mergers provide a means to funnel gas into the central
region of the system, consequently triggering episodes of nuclear star
formation and supermassive black holes growth. The details of the fueling
and feedback are often obscured by the cocooning dust stirred up from the
violent interaction. To probe the small-scale gas kinematics in the inner
kiloparsec region of these local luminous infrared galaxies requires high
spatial resolution observations of their nuclei. Here I present results
from our Keck Adaptive Optics near-infrared integral-field survey of the
nuclear regions in 17 late-stage galaxy mergers. Our findings characterized
and addressed the nature of nuclear disks, outflows driven by AGN and
starbursts, as well as the role of mergers in black hole-galaxy bulge
scaling relations. Our observations further enabled several case studies
showing direct evidence of biconical molecular outflows as well as shocked
gas from winds and ISM collision between progenitor galaxies.


Speaker: Dr. Nicolas Altobelli (ESA)
Topic:Cassini-Huygens, 10 years of discoveries...and more to come!
Time: May 14, 2pm
Place: S4-1013, NCU

Abstract:
The Cassini-Huygens mission has greatly enhanced our understanding of
the Saturn system. Fundamental discoveries have altered our views of
Saturn, the icy moons including Titan, the dynamic rings, and the
system's complex magnetosphere. Launched in 1997, the Cassini-Huygens
spacecraft spent seven years traveling to Saturn, arriving in July
2004, roughly two years after the northern winter solstice. Cassini
has orbited Saturn for 9.5 years, delivering the Huygens probe to its
Titan landing in 2005, crossing northern equinox in August 2009, and
completing its Prime and Equinox Missions. It is now three years into
its 7-year Solstice mission, returning science in a previously
unobserved seasonal phase between equinox and solstice. As it watches
the approach of northern summer, long-dark regions throughout the
system become sunlit, allowing Cassini's science instruments to probe
as-yet unsolved mysteries.

Key Cassini-Huygens discoveries include icy jets of material streaming
from tiny Enceladus' south pole, lakes of liquid hydrocarbons and
methane rain on giant Titan, three-dimensional structures in Saturn's
rings, and curtain-like aurorae flickering over Saturn's poles. The
Huygens probe sent back amazing images of Titan's surface, and made
detailed measurements of the atmospheric composition, structure and
winds. Key Cassini-Huygens science highlights will be presented.

The Solstice Mission continues to provide new science. First, the
Cassini spacecraft observes seasonally and temporally dependent
processes on Saturn, Titan, Enceladus and other icy satellites, and
within the rings and magnetosphere. Second, it addresses new questions
that have arisen during the mission thus far, for example providing
qualitatively new measurements of Enceladus and Titan that could not
be accommodated in the earlier mission phases. Third, it will conduct
a close-in mission at Saturn yielding fundamental knowledge about the
interior of Saturn. This 'Grand Finale' of the mission occurs in 2017,
when a series of 22 inclined orbits sends Cassini between the
innermost D ring and the upper portions of Saturn's atmosphere,
enabling unique gravity and magnetic field measurements of the planet,
unprecedented determination of the ring mass, some of the highest
resolution measurements of the rings and Saturn, and in situ
observations in a completely new region around the planet.
