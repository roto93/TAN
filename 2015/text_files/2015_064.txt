*NCU Astronomy Colloquium*
Speaker: Dr. Sundar Srinivasan (ASIAA)
Topic: The dust return from AGB stars in nearby galaxies
Time: Mar. 27, 2pm
Place: S4-1013, NCU

Abstract:
Asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars lose a substantial fraction of their
mass in slow, dust-driven winds. This mass loss directly influences the
life cycle of dust and gas in galaxies. The dust consists of either
oxygen-rich or carbonaceous partiels, depending on the relative atomic
abundance of carbon to oxygen (the C/O ratio) in the photospheric regions.
Determining the current rate of AGB dust production requires information
about the spectral energy distributions (SEDs), especially in the infrared.
While large-scale studies of the Galactic AGB dust budget have been
restricted to the Bulge or the Solar Neighbourhood, data from the Spitzer
Space Telescope has enabled the identification of large AGB populations in
nearby galaxies such as the Magellanic Clouds, allowing us to estimate the
current AGB dust budget in these systems. These studies find that the dust
production is dominated by a small fraction of very dusty, highly evolved
stars. However, the global estimates seem too small to explain the observed
interstellar dust mass. In this talk, I will review the theoretical and
observational constraints on AGB dust production in nearby galaxies and
discuss possible solutions to the dust budget "crisis".
