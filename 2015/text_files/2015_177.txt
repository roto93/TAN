********************************
 Call for Proposals of KaVA (KVN and VERA Array)
 Deadline:  November 02, 2015, 08:00 UT.
*********************************


Dear Colleagues.

 We invite proposals for the open use observations of the KaVA, a joint
VLBI array
 of the KVN (Korean VLBI Network) and the VERA (VLBI exploration of Radio
 Astrometry). The joint array consists of three 21-m KVN telescopes and
 four 20-m VERA telescopes, with baseline lengths ranging from 300 km to
2300 km.

 This open-use call will be based on risk-share, and provide VLBI
observations at
 22GHz and 43GHz for astronomers in the world. We can support astronomers
who are
 not familiar with VLBI technique in the preparation of proposals,
scheduling, and data
 analysis. Proposers are requested to include at least one collaborator
from VERA or KVN.
 If it is difficult to find collaborators from VERA or KVN, we can support
to find them.
 The contact address for the support is kavaprop (at-mark) kasi.re.kr.

 Observations will be conducted with single polarization (LCP) and 1-Gbps
data rate.
 The total available observation time is up to 250 hours and the
observations will be
 scheduled between January15, 2016 and July 15, 2016. The maximum observing
 time per proposal is 48 hours.
 If requested in the proposals, the observation time can be allocated over
a year,
 until January 15, 2017, for this call. But the maximum observation time
will be NOT increased.
 The deadline of submission is at 08:00 UT November 02, 2015.
 More detailed information on the KaVA call-for-proposal can be found in
 http://kava.kasi.re.kr/contents/proposal_info.php?mid=020101

 ToO opportunity
 Target of Opportunity proposals can be submitted to regular CfP of KaVA.
 Also, unexpected or urgent ToO can be submitted Director's time at any
time.
 These proposals must include specific triggering criteria to initiate a
observation.
 The ToO is active one year from it is approved. The proposals to
Director's time must be
 submitted by PDF files using e-mail to kavaprop (at-mark) kasi.re.kr.

 If you have any questions, please send an email to kavaprop (at-mark)
kasi.re.kr

 Sincerely,

                     Hyun-Goo Kim
                      Director of Radio Astronomy Division, KASI
                        and
                     Mareki Honma
                     Director of Mizusawa VLBI Observatory, NAOJ
