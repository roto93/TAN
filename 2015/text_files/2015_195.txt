*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________
Speaker:        Dmitry Semenov (Max Planck Institute for Astronomy)
Topic:          Molecules as probes of physics of the ISM and protoplanetary disks

Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Molecular lines provide powerful diagnostics of thermal, density and kinematics structure of gas in various astrophysical environments. To assess this wealth of information, however, one has to understand how formation and destruction of molecules in space proceed, and how molecular lines are excited. In my review talk I'll first summarize our current understanding of these processes. Then, I'll highlight a few interesting cases how chemical modeling and analysis can help astronomers to probe temperatures, densities, and evolutionary phases in the regions of low- and high-mass star formation and protoplanetary disks. These will include synthesis of complex organic molecules and deuterium fractionation in infrared dark clouds (IRDCs) and Hot Cores as well as in prestellar cores and protoplanetary disks. A particular emphasis will be put to discuss a possible origin of Earth's water and carbon matter.
