                BLACK HOLE ACCRETION AND AGN FEEDBACK

                    June 1-5, 2015; Shanghai, China

( Apologies if you receive this announcement more than once.)

  ************************ SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE**************************

Both black hole accretion and galaxy formation and evolution are important
research topics in astrophysics. They focus on quite different scales and
both have been intensively studied. While the fueling of black hole is
controlled by the host galaxy, there is considerable observational evidence
in recent years that output from the accretion onto the black hole located
in the galactic center plays an important role in controlling the evolution
of galaxies. This is called =E2=80=9CAGN feedback=E2=80=9D. How this mechan=
ism works,
however, still remains poorly understood. The theme of this conference is
to bring experts in both the black hole accretion and galaxy
formation/evolution communities, to share our expertise, so as to improve
our understanding to the physics of AGN feedback.

The topics to be covered in the conference include:

1) Theory of black hole accretion and radiation; angular momentum transfer
in various scales

2) Theory of jet and wind production; their energy, mass and momentum fluxe=
s

3) Observations of winds, jets from back holes in AGNs and X-ray binaries

4) Interactions between black hole outflows and the ISM: Observation and
theory

5) Galaxy evolution and central black hole feedback; interactions and
relations

The registration in now open. Deadlines for early registration and abstract
submission oral presentations are March 31, 2015. Detailed information is
available on our website:
