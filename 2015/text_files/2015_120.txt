Speaker:     Po-Feng Wu (University of Hawaii)
Topic:          The Cosmicflows Project and the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) Method
Time:          6/8 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
The Cosmicflows Project compiles distances and peculiar velocities for over 8000 galaxies. The purpose is to develop a three-dimensional map of the distribution of matter and motions of galaxies in the local universe, in order to study the large-scale structure and the formation process. One of the important methods of acquiring distance in the Cosmicflows Project is the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) method. The TRGB method is highly accurate and efficient in distance determination, allowing detailed studies in our neighboring Universe. I will introduce the current status and the public product of the Cosmicflow Project, and some new findings derived from the product, especially from the TRGB method.
