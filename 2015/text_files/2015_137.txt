Dear Yi-Jehng,

The EAO has posted a job ad for an Electronics Engineer. A copy of this ad is attached and you can also direct people to the EAO Employment webpage at
http://www.eaobservatory.org/east-asia-observatory/employment/jcmtjobs/

As a member of the EAO personnel committee, I would appreciate your assistance in bringing this to the attention of suitable qualified people.

Thanks.

Best,

Ron
