Post-Doctoral Researchers in Optical Time-Domain Astronomy -- National
Central University (Taiwan)

The Graduate Institute of Astronomy at National Central University (IANCU)
is seeking qualified candidates for two post-doctoral researchers to work
in two different projects. IANCU owns and operates the Lulin Observatory in
central Taiwan. IANCU is actively participating in the "intermediate
Palomar Transit Factory" (iPTF) project and the "Global Relay of
Observatories Watching Transients Happen" (GROWTH) project. IANCU is also
expected to join the "Zwicky Transient Facility" (ZTF) in near future. One
post-doc position is responsible to robotize the small telescopes at Lulin
Observatory in order to meet the observational requirement for GROWTH. The
candidate for this position will also need to participate in the research
involving asteroids, variable stars and transients using the data from iPTF
(and ZTF), GROWTH and LOT. The second position will be focused on the
research of variable stars in stellar clusters and local group galaxies.
This position requires frequent visits to observatories in Taiwan and
around the world for imaging and spectroscopic observations, as well as
develop data reduction pipelines. Skills on spectroscopic reductions and
extracting radial velocities is strongly preferred.

Applicants must have a degree in PhD (or expected to receive PhD before 30
October 2015) during application. The applicants should also have
experience and background in observation with optical telescopes and
programming (c or python). A good oral communication in Mandarin Chinese is
preferred, but not required. Initial duration of the positions is two
years, and extendable to third year depending on the performance of the
candidates and availability of funding. Please sent a CV, a list of
publication and a research plan, together with three reference letters, by
email to Chow-Choong Ngeow (cngeow@astro.ncu.edu.tw) before 01 December,
2015, or until the positions are filled. Please indicate which position the
candidate is applied for. Starting date is negotiable and can be as
earliest as possible. Availability of both (or either one) positions will
depends on the outcome of funding.

*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________
Speaker:        Cynthia Chiang (University of KwaZulu‑Natal)
Topic:          Searching for the Echoes of Inflation with SPIDER
Time:           9/23 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
The cosmic microwave background (CMB) is a powerful tool for cosmology, encoding a wealth of information about the universe's history and structure.  In particular, precision CMB polarimetry has long held the promise of revealing the physics of inflation through a minuscule "B-mode" imprint that is imparted by primordial gravitational waves.  I will discuss our current knowledge of CMB polarization, and I will describe a new instrument, SPIDER, that aims to characterize the inflationary B-mode signal with high sensitivity and fidelity.  SPIDER is a balloon-borne telescope that launched from McMurdo Station, Antarctica on January 1, 2015, and successfully observed for 16 days.  I will discuss the preliminary in-flight performance and prospects for the science analysis.

Speaker:        Jonathan Sievers (University of KwaZulu‑Natal)
Topic:          HIRAX and the Search for Fast Radio Bursts
Time:           9/24 (Thursday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
The Hydrogen Intensity and Real-time Analysis eXperiment (HIRAX) is a
proposed array of 1024 cheap 6m dishes that has received preliminary
approval from the South African NRF.  The main goals of HIRAX include
measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations at redshift 0.8-2.5,
searching for new pulsars and radio transients, and discovery of new
neutral hydrogen absorbers.  Preparations for HIRAX include the
development of a new pipeline to search for Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs),
which are some of the most enigmatic things in the sky.  They burst
incredibly brightly (~10 Jy) for a millisecond, never to be seen
again, and their origin and even distance (and hence energy scale) is
completely unknown.  We have run the trial pipeline on 650 hours of
suitable GBT data looking for FRBs.  We present an overview of HIRAX
and preliminary results from the FRB search.

*NCU Astronomy Colloquium*
Speaker: Prof. Pisin Chen (NTU)
Topic: Radiowave Detection of Ultra High Energy Cosmic Neutrinos and Cosmic
Rays
Time: Sep. 25, 2pm
Place: S4-1013, NCU

Abstract:
There have been exciting advancements in searching for ultra high energy
cosmic neutrinos in recent years. In addition to important results from
IceCube, there have been a series of experiments/observatories based on the
Askaryan effect and geomagnetic synchrotron effect for detection that aim
at the detection of highest energy cosmic neutrinos. Among them the
balloon-borne ANITA project has made its 3rd mission in Antarctica in the
2014-2015 winter. Ongoing ground-based projects include ARA (Askaryan Radio
Array)at the South Pole and ARIANNA on Ross Bay Shelf, Antarctica. The
Taiwan team has been playing a leading role in ARA since its inception. The
antenna stations built by the Taiwan team has been collecting data since
their deployment 2.5 years ago. Several more stations, again built by the
Taiwan team, are now scheduled to be deployed at the Pole in the coming two
years. Last but not least, taking advantage of steep high mountains along
Taiwan=E2=80=99s East Coast, we have launched an exciting new observatory b=
y the
name =E5=A4=AA=E9=AD=AF=E9=96=A3, or TAROGE (Taiwan Astroparticle Radiowave=
 Observatory for
Geosynchrotron Emission), to look over the Pacific Ocean in search of ultra
high energy cosmic rays and earth skimming neutrinos. In this talk we will
review these activities as well as their physics potentials and future
prospects.
