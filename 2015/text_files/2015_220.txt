Title: Infrared AGNs in Galaxy Evolution
Abstract: I will present a study of the connection between activity of
nuclear accretion, star formation, and galaxy morphology. In our work, we
focus on infrared selected AGNs, which are complementary samples of X-ray
selected objects. We fit optical to far-infrared photometry by the latest
SED techniques to derive stellar masses, star formation rates, dust
properties, and AGN contribution in the COSMOS field. We explore galaxy
morphologies through HST/ACS images, which provide structural properties of
galaxy stellar component at high redshift. We discover the differences
between obscured AGN host galaxies and star-forming galaxies. We discuss
the influence of compaction scenario and the role of AGNs in galaxy
evolution.
