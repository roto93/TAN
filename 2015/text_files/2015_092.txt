*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Suklima Niyogi (Leiden University)
Topic:         Massive stars and cosmic interstellar dust
Time:         4/29 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:          R1203
Abstract:
Dust is a key component of the interstellar medium (ISM) of galaxies. Dust grains form primarily in the ejecta of the stars. The two main sources of dust are the winds of low-to intermediate mass (< 8 Msun) stars and the rapidly evolving high-mass stars (> 8 Msun). In our Milky Way Galaxy, low-mass stars mainly dominate the injection of dust into the ISM during the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase. But the origin of dust in galaxies in the very early universe is controversial. The observed high abundance of dust in galaxies in the early Universe has often been taken to imply that rapidly evolving, high- mass stars are an important dust source. To quantify the dust properties (e.g. mass, composition), I analyzed the spectral energy distribution (SED) of a sample of Luminous blue variables (LBVs) and B[e] supergiants in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). For this purpose, I have used spectroscopic and photometric observational data from Spitzer Space Telescope and Herschel O!
bservatory. I computed the model spectra of these stars by using radiative transfer code MCMax. From the best fit models, I derived the time-averaged dust mass-loss rates of these high-mass stars and compared with the dust mass-loss rates of low-mass AGB stars. Based on this analysis, I speculate that high-mass stars are an important dust source in the ISM of the LMC and further detailed investigation is required.
