*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________
Speaker:        Stefan Hilbert (Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München)
Topic:          Linking Gravitational Lensing Observations and Theory with Simulations
Time:           12/16 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Gravitational lensing effects allow us to study the the large-scale geometry and matter distribution of our Universe, and thereby can provide unique insights into, e.g., the nature of dark energy, dark matter, and their connection to the luminous matter. Numerical simulations are essential for the quantitative interpretation of gravitational lensing observations and for extracting accurate constraints for physical models of galaxies, the large-scale structure, and our whole Universe. I discuss several applications of numerical simulations to better understand strong and weak gravitational lensing observations for cosmology.


*** Special Seminar ***
____________________________________________________
Speaker:        Sperello di Serego Alighieri (INAF - Osservatorio Astrofisico di Arcetri)
Topic:          Dust in Early-Type Galaxies
Time:           12/17 (Thursday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Dust is an important component of the multi-phase interstellar medium of Early-Type Galaxies (ETG) and can give important clues on the origin and evolution of ETG.
After an introduction to the subject I will show and discuss recent results obtained on the dust content of a complete sample of 910 ETG in the Virgo cluster with the Herschel satellite and on a comparison of these data with those obtained on a similar sample of H-ATLAS/GAMA ETG in low density environment.
