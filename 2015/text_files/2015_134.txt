Speaker:        Yu Gao (Purple Mountain Observatory)
Topic:          The global star formation laws in galaxies
Time:           7/9 (Thursday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
The global star formation law — the relation between gas and star formation rate (SFR) — is studied in a large sample of 181 local galaxies with infrared (IR) luminosities (SFR) spanning almost five orders of magnitude. The surface density of dense molecular gas (as traced by HCN) has the tightest and linear correlation with that of SFR. We further show that the SFR and a variety of dense gas tracers (HCN, CS, their high-J, high-J CO) are all linearly correlated for both the Galactic dense cores in our Milky Way and star-forming galaxies near and far. This has immediate implications on the modes of star formation in galaxies and suggests that dense cores are the basic units in contributing to the star formation and the SFR might depend linearly upon the mass of dense molecular gas (the dense gas star formation law). These ground-based observations of last decade and recent Herschel results highlight what the ALMA can deliver on the studies of star formation laws at all r!
 edshifts and on all scales.
