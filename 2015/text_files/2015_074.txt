Title: Enigma of near-infrared background

Abstract:

  It has been thought first stars of the universe are very massive and
luminous, however, it is
difficult to detect individual stars even with JWST. We have tried to
observe near-infrared
background to detect integrated redshifted light of first stars. Space
probes (COBE,
IRTS, AKARI and Spitzer) succeeded to detect excess sky brightness and
fluctuation
that can not been explained with known foreground emission sources. Recent
sounding
rocket experiment, CIBER (Cosmic Infrared Background ExpeRiment) also
detected large
excess brightness and fluctuation at 1.0 and 1.6 micron. However, recent
observational
evidences and theoretical studies make it difficult to attribute observed
excess brightness
and fluctuation to first stars. IHL (Intra Halo Light) surrounding low z
galaxies and DCBHs
(Direct Collapsed Black Holes) at high z are proposed, but have difficulty
to explain
observational results. It is now enigma what emission source can explain
observed excess
brightness and fluctuation of near-infrared background.
