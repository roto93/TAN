Topic:         Atmospheric Dynamics on Extrasolar Planets
Time:         4/8 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
By far, the most thoroughly observationally and theoretically characterized extrasolar planets are the class of short-period, highly irradiated, gas-giant planets. Though much of our understanding of atmospheric dynamics and planetary evolution is derived from solar system planets, observations and models of these exoplanets have suggested the dynamics of their atmospheres is dramatically different than anything within our own solar system. Their short-periods suggest that these planets are tidally locked to their host stars, resulting in extremely large longitudinal temperature gradients. Coupled to the planets rotation, this results in semi-static, supersonic jets that dominate all other dynamical features above pressures of several thousand bars. I will discuss the multiple aspects of these models utilizing 3D radiative hydrodynamical models coupled to a variety of models exploring jet formation, the formation of exotic clouds, and overall planetary evolution. Detailed â€!
˜observationsâ€™ of our models allow us to both benchmark our models and predict future observations.
