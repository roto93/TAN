# This mail is sent to all the previous proposers 
# and visitors of Subaru Telescope by BCC. 

Dear Colleague, 

This is to announce the opening of Call for Proposals 
for the Subaru Telescope open use semester S15B 
from 2015 August 1 through 2016 January 31. 

Detailed Information on the available instruments 

[HSC, HDS, IRCS, Suprime-Cam, FMOS, COMICS, MOIRCS, 
FOCAS, AO188 (NGS or LGS; usable with IRCS)] 

and the details concerning proposal submission are available 
at the following website: 

http://www.naoj.org/Observing/Proposals/Submit/call.html 

Please visit this site and read the description carefully 
before submitting your proposals. 

The deadline for Normal/Intensive Programs is 

<<<March 10 (Tue), 2015, 12:00 (Noon) in JST>>> [e.g., 3.00am in UT], 

while that for the Service program is 4 weeks later than this 
(April  7 (Tue), 2015, 12:00 (Noon) in JST). 

While only several important points are briefly summarized below, 
please consult the web page for more detailed information. 

(1) Abstract of Accepted Proposals Going to Be Opened 

The complete text of the abstract of all the accepted Subaru 
proposals from S15B semester will be open to the public 
at the same time of the data release (i.e., after the proprietary 
period of 18 months has expired). 

(2) New Science Category 'Metal-poor stars' 

A new category 'metal-poor stars' has been introduced mainly for 
proposals intending to observe individual old stars as probes 
to study chemical evolution (nucleosynthesis history) of our Galaxy 
or local-group galaxies. 

(3) Use of Hyper Suprime-Cam 

Regarding HSC, there will be 4 observing runs (allocated to dark 
or dark-gray nights in August, October, November, and January). 
One narrow band filter (NB816) will be opened from S15B. 

(4) Polarimetry Mode of IRCS+AO188 

In S15B, polarimetry modes of IRCS+AO188 are newly available 
for imaging (for Y-, J-, H-, and K-bands) as well as spectroscopic 
observations (for zJH and HK) in a shared-risk operation. 
IRCS observations will be conducted always in combination with 
AO188 optics, regardless of the use of AO correction. 

(5) Possibility of Instrument Decommission 

Please keep in mind the possibility that S-Cam and/or FMOS, 
which are available as usual still in S15B, might be decommissioned 
and unavailable from S16A. Similar decommissioning is under 
consideration also for HiCIAO and/or Kyoto3DII (PI instruments). 

(6) MOIRCS Detector Replacement 

Due to the detector replacement work, MOIRCS can not be used 
in early S15B for about 2 months but expected to be available 
from 2015 October in a shared-risk mode. 

(7) Application from Keck/Gemini Community 

Non-Japanese PIs who wish to use the Subaru Telescope but have 
access to Keck or Gemini telescope time should in principle 
apply through the time-exchange programs provided by Keck or Gemini. 

Best regards, 

Subaru Open Use Team

***********************************************************************

                BLACK HOLE ACCRETION AND AGN FEEDBACK

                    June 1-5, 2015; Shanghai, China

( Apologies if you receive this announcement more than once.)

  ************************ SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE**************************

Both black hole accretion and galaxy formation and evolution are important
research topics in astrophysics. They focus on quite different scales and
both have been intensively studied. While the fueling of black hole is
controlled by the host galaxy, there is considerable observational evidence
in recent years that output from the accretion onto the black hole located
in the galactic center plays an important role in controlling the evolution
of galaxies. This is called =E2=80=9CAGN feedback=E2=80=9D. How this mechan=
ism works,
however, still remains poorly understood. The theme of this conference is
to bring experts in both the black hole accretion and galaxy
formation/evolution communities, to share our expertise, so as to improve
our understanding to the physics of AGN feedback.

The topics to be covered in the conference include:

1) Theory of black hole accretion and radiation; angular momentum transfer
in various scales

2) Theory of jet and wind production; their energy, mass and momentum fluxe=
s

3) Observations of winds, jets from back holes in AGNs and X-ray binaries

4) Interactions between black hole outflows and the ISM: Observation and
theory

5) Galaxy evolution and central black hole feedback; interactions and
relations

The registration in now open. Deadlines for early registration and abstract
submission oral presentations are March 31, 2015. Detailed information is
available on our website:

Dear Yi-Jehng,

    Please kindly help to distribute the following JCMT CfP information via TAN. Thanks very much!

————
Dear colleagues,

    The Call for Proposals for Observing Time Semester 15A at JCMT aimed for the EAO Pilot Science Programs has been released. The information is listed at the webpage - "http://www.eaobservatory.org/jcmt/proposals/CfP15A/“

    As noted in the call, this is the first semester for JCMT operating under the management of the East Asian Observatories, and the intention in 15A is to encourage as many new users as possible to get experience with JCMT and prepare for future, larger programs.

    The 15A semester runs from 1st March to 30th June 2015. The closing date for receipt of proposals is Tuesday 31 March 2015 (15:00 Hawaiian Standard Time). The observatory has started accepting proposals and the submitted proposals will be assessed for technical feasibility and processed as they are received. Again, please find more details in the CfP webpage.

    In the meantime, please note below a couple items related to the JCMT science and proposal preparation in Taiwan as well.

    1) For interested users:
      *) You are strongly encouraged to sign-up for the jcmt users list by sending an email to: jcmt_users-join@eaobservatory.org. This is to help the observatory to distribute information directly to you as it is needed.
      *) You are also strongly encouraged to fill in the survey form below 
        "https://docs.google.com/a/asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/forms/d/1EvbhB-laSbmtSpeuoe_pANd7RecF_GOw2WwHjfuX17E/viewform”. This will help us to push and coordinate the programs.

    2) The webpage of the Taiwan JCMT Science Workshop has been updated. Slides from some of the science talks were uploaded. For the presentation slides about JCMT operation, instrumentation, proposal preparation and submission, as well as data access and reduction, you can go to the following webpage,
    "http://www.eaobservatory.org/jcmt/help/workshops/“

    3) Finally, recall the EAO JCMT Twiki page, where you may follow and participate online discussions about some of the potential survey programs.

    Please prepare and submit your pilot science proposals as soon as possible and do feel free to contact the JCMT staffs directly through the helpdesk at helpdesk@eaobservatory.org, or me, if you find questions.

best,
sheng-yuan

Speaker:    Hsi-An Pan (Hokkaido University)
Topic:         What is a Giant Molecular Cloud? Are Observers and Simulators Discussing the Same Star-forming Clouds?
Time:         2/16 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
Observations and simulations have now reached the point where the giant molecular cloud (GMCs) populations can be studied over a whole galaxy. This is immensely helpful for understanding star formation, since the cloud properties set the conditions for new star birth. Yet, are these two groups really comparing the same objects? While simulators work in position-position-position (PPP) space, observers see projected properties along the line of sight, identifying clouds in position-position-velocity (PPV) space. If these methods do not identify the same objects, then the interpretation and comparisons between the data sets may be highly misleading. In this research we generated PPV and PPP data for a high-resolution simulated galaxy and compared the identified cloud properties in both data sets.
