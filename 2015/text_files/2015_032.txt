Dear colleagues,

    The Call for Proposals for Observing Time Semester 15A at JCMT aimed for the EAO Pilot Science Programs has been released. The information is listed at the webpage - "http://www.eaobservatory.org/jcmt/proposals/CfP15A/“

    As noted in the call, this is the first semester for JCMT operating under the management of the East Asian Observatories, and the intention in 15A is to encourage as many new users as possible to get experience with JCMT and prepare for future, larger programs.

    The 15A semester runs from 1st March to 30th June 2015. The closing date for receipt of proposals is Tuesday 31 March 2015 (15:00 Hawaiian Standard Time). The observatory has started accepting proposals and the submitted proposals will be assessed for technical feasibility and processed as they are received. Again, please find more details in the CfP webpage.

    In the meantime, please note below a couple items related to the JCMT science and proposal preparation in Taiwan as well.

    1) For interested users:
      *) You are strongly encouraged to sign-up for the jcmt users list by sending an email to: jcmt_users-join@eaobservatory.org. This is to help the observatory to distribute information directly to you as it is needed.
      *) You are also strongly encouraged to fill in the survey form below 
        "https://docs.google.com/a/asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/forms/d/1EvbhB-laSbmtSpeuoe_pANd7RecF_GOw2WwHjfuX17E/viewform”. This will help us to push and coordinate the programs.

    2) The webpage of the Taiwan JCMT Science Workshop has been updated. Slides from some of the science talks were uploaded. For the presentation slides about JCMT operation, instrumentation, proposal preparation and submission, as well as data access and reduction, you can go to the following webpage,
    "http://www.eaobservatory.org/jcmt/help/workshops/“

    3) Finally, recall the EAO JCMT Twiki page, where you may follow and participate online discussions about some of the potential survey programs.

    Please prepare and submit your pilot science proposals as soon as possible and do feel free to contact the JCMT staffs directly through the helpdesk at helpdesk@eaobservatory.org, or me, if you find questions.

best,
sheng-yuan
