Title: Progenitors of core-collapse supernovae: what we know, what we
think we know and what do we not know.
Abstract: The last 15 years has seen a dramatic increase in our
knowledge of the stars that explode in core-collapse supernovae. Prior
to this only two stars had been identified in pre-explosion images as
the stars that gave rise to a supernovae. Today this number is
approaching detections or constraints for 50 supernovae and we can
start understanding the population of stars that explode in greater
detail. While we know for certain that the progenitors of type IIP
supernovae are red supergiants there is still much confusion over the
remaining supernova types. Most worrying of all we have not detected a
progenitor with an initial mass greater than 20 Solar Masses which has
implications for how stars explode.
