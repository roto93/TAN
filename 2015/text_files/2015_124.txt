Hi,

Next Wednesday, 6/17, our colloquium will be given by Wiphu Rujopakarn from
the Kavli IPMU.  Wiphu works on infrared and radio data to study galaxy
evolution from redshift z~3 to the local universe.  He will be here all day
on 6/17, so if you are interested in meeting with him, please let me know.
His talk title and abstract is below.

I am also organizing a colloquium lunch/dinner on that day.  I will send a
separate announcement once Wiphu's schedule is more clear.

Thanks,
-Ken

Resolving the Obscured Cosmic Accretion History and Modes of Galaxy Assembly

Wiphu Rujopakarn (Kavli IPMU, Tokyo; Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok)

Dust obscuration has hidden at least half of the cosmic accretion
activity and concealed the most intense sites of star formation during
the peak epoch for both processes in galaxy evolution at 1 < z < 3.
Centimetric radio interferometry is the only means of identifying the
AGNs and tracing star-forming activities at sub-arcsecond resolution,
in an extinction-independent manner.  I will discuss the use of radio
survey to study star formation and AGN at 1 < z < 3, focusing on the
early results from two ultra-deep 4-8 GHz Jansky VLA (JVLA) radio
observations at 0.3" resolution in the UDS and HUDF fields. The goals
of these surveys are to combine the radio data with the existing
panchromatic observations to produce a complete census of AGN and to
spatially resolve the star-forming galaxies. The ongoing survey in the
HUDF, in particular, will reach 0.3 microJy/beam RMS and will provide
the definitive radio dataset for spatially-resolved, ultra-deep,
broadband extragalactic studies until the SKA era.
