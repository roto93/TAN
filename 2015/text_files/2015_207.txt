Speaker:        Alessandro Sonnenfeld (Kavli IPMU)
Topic:          Luminous and Dark Matter in Early-type Galaxies
Time:           12/7 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Strong gravitational lensing is a very powerful tool for measuring galaxy masses at cosmological distances and provides a unique opportunity for probing the distribution of dark matter and baryons in the most massive galaxies.
We analysed a sample of 80 early-type galaxy strong lenses covering the redshift range 0.1 < z < 0.8. Using a Bayesian hierarchical inference approach we constrained the average properties of the distribution of dark matter masses and stellar Initial Mass Function across the population of massive galaxies. We find a positive correlation between galaxy mass and stellar IMF an anticorrelation between galaxy size and dark matter mass: at fixed stellar mass, the most compact systems appear to have a smaller amount of dark matter, in projection, within the inner 5 kpc.  This result is consistent with a scenario in which central galaxies in more massive halos experience more mergers relative to their less massive halos counterparts.


*** Special Seminar ***

Speaker:        Stephane Guilloteau (Laboratoire d'Astrophysique de Bordeaux)
Topic:          Fast imaging with ALMA : from CASA to GILDAS
Time:           12/7 (Monday) 09:30 - 10:30
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
The ALMA interferrometer uses the CASA software for calibration and imaging.
While calibration can only be done with CASA, other softwares can be used for
imaging. This can be convenient as CASA is rather slow.

Exporting data from CASA is however non trivial, and requires some understanding of the differences between the data model used in CASA and the destination software.

I will show how to transfer calibrated ALMA data from CASA to GILDAS, and
illustrate the capacities of GILDAS to handle efficiently large data set. I will
show how to efficiently use the fast visualisation and deconvolution tools
of Mapping, as well as the spectral line analysis tools available in CLASS
(natively of through the Python Weeds plug-in).


*** Colloquium ***

Speaker:        Anne Dutrey (Laboratoire d'Astrophysique de Bordeaux)
Topic:          GG Tau: The Ringworld and Beyond Mass Accretion and Planetary Formation in Young Multiple Stellar Systems
Time:           12/9 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
In binary stellar systems, exoplanet searches have revealed planetary
mass companions orbiting both in circumstellar and in circumbinary
orbits. HD simulations and observations reveal that circumstellar and circumbinary
disks may exhibit different physical conditions for planet formation. Although
binaries and higher order multiple stars are relatively common in nearby star
forming regions, surprisingly few systems with circumbinary distributions of
proto-planetary material have been found. GG Tau A is one of these systems,
it has a spectacular ring of dust and gas encircling its central
triple star  has become a unique laboratory for investigating the physics of
circumsystem gas and dust evolution. I review in this talk its
physical properties in light of mass accretion and possible planet formation.
