Title: "Gravitational Lensing in Relativistic MOdified Newtonian Dynamics".
Abstract:
"The dark matter, or more accurately =E2=80=9Cmissing mass=E2=80=9D, probl=
em could well be
the most important and most long standing issue in astrophysics. In this
work, we review this problem from the galaxies scale to the cosmology.
Then, we focus on the alternative solution =E2=80=9CModified Newtonian Dyna=
mics=E2=80=9D
(MOND) which interprets =E2=80=9Cmissing mass=E2=80=9D as =E2=80=9Caccelera=
tion discrepancy=E2=80=9D.
We also introduce relativistic gravity theories in MOND. Our work focuses
especially on gravitational lensing and time delay within the relativistic
version of MOND. We derive the lensing formulation in relativistic MOND and
test it on strong lensing cases. Although the results are preliminary for
the spherically symmetric case, the lens mass of an elliptical galaxy in
lensing and the Hubble constant in time delay are still consistent within
the relativistic MOND paradigm. Moreover, the masses of lens galaxies
estimated from dynamics and from gravitational lensing are also consistent
in our study."
