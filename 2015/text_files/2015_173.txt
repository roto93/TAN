  Our apologies if you receive this email more than once. Please circulate
it among your colleagues.


  We are happy to announce the following international meeting:


*Blazars through Sharp Multi-Wavelength Eyes*
M=C3=A1laga (Spain), May 30 =E2=80=93 June 3, 2016

http://jets2016.iaa.es


*FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT*


Blazars, the most extreme variety of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and the
most luminous long-lived individual objects in the universe, continue to
pose major astrophysical puzzles. This international conference will be
devoted to recent progress in observational and theoretical aspects of
blazars and advances in our understanding of the "big picture'' of the
blazar phenomenon.

Blazars radiate across the electromagnetic spectrum from radio to gamma-ray
frequencies. Observations of blazars require a variety of state-of-the-art
instruments and techniques, while understanding jet formation and
production of high-energy particles and photons is among the most prominent
problems of modern astrophysics.

The timing of the conference is well matched to the availability of premier
high-energy facilities, such as the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, the
Chandra, Swift, NuSTAR, and Astrosat X-ray satellites, new high-resolution
arrays such as the Event Horizon Telescope, RadioAstron, and ALMA,
sensitive very high-energy gamma-ray Cherenkov detectors, and long-term
monitoring with the Very Long Baseline Array, Global mm-VLBI Array, and
optical-IR telescopes.

The meeting will have the extra motivation of celebrating Prof. Alan
Marscher's contributions to blazar research.

Topics to be discussed include:

   - Jet formation, dynamics, and astrometry
   - Probes of blazar jets with the finest angular resolution through EHT,
   mm-VLBI, and RadioAstron observations
   - Multi-wavelength studies of blazars from theory and observations
   - Magnetic fields and polarization
   - Non-blazar AGN jets


Prof. Alan Marscher will present an especial talk with a =E2=80=9CRetrospec=

The meeting will take place at Hotel Pueblo Camino Real, located on the
beach front in M=C3=A1laga (Spain), with a conference hall that can accommo=
date
close to 200 people, and has arranged a special accommodation rate for the
conference attendants.

A second announcement will be sent once the registration and abstract
submission are open.
