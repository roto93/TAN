*NCU Astronomy Colloquium*
Speaker: Dr. Yen Hsi-Wei (ASIAA)
Topic:Observational Studies of Disk Formation Around Protostars
Time: May 08, 2pm
Place: S4-1013, NCU

Abstract:

Circumstellar disks are ubiquitous around young stellar objects and
are considered to be the sites of planet formation. How these disks
form during the processes of star formation is not well understood.
Conventionally, formation of a disk in a collapsing dense core is
expected as a consequence of angular momentum conservation. Later
theoretical studies of collapsing dense cores incorporating magnetic
field suggest that the magnetic field can slow down gas motions and
suppress disk formation. However, such effects have not yet been
observationally confirmed or constrained. In this presentation, I will
introduce our observational results of gas motions around a sample of
protostars obtained with single dishes, SMA, and ALMA. With these
observations, we have found evolution of gas motions toward Keplerian
rotation and transitional regions from collapsing cores to disks,
i.e., signs of disk formation in the early stage of star formation.
Opposite to this, we have also found few protostars where disk
formation can be suppressed. I will discuss these results in the
context of disk formation with and without magnetic field.
