Arizona Radio Observatory: Call for Proposals (Spring 2015)
------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Astronomers in Taiwan,

Observing proposals from members of the University Consortium of ALMA-Taiwan
(UCAT) and ASIAA for the 10-meter Submillimeter Telescope (SMT), located on
Mount Graham, Arizona, of the Arizona Radio Observatory (ARO) are being
solicited for the period February 15, 2015 to June 15, 2015. Proposals will
also be accepted on a limited shared-risk basis for the new ALMA Prototype
12-meter Telescope (12m) located on Kitt Peak, Arizona. The proposal deadline
of UCAT/ASIAA for this 2015 spring semester is set on February 06, 2015 (Fri).

The SMT currently supports a dual-polarization, 1-mm (211-275 GHz) receiver
with ALMA Band 6 sideband-separating (SBS) mixers, a dual-polarization 0.8-mm
(320-370 GHz) receiver, a dual-polarization 0.7 mm (420-500 GHz) SIS receiver
with SBS mixers, and a 0.4-mm (602-720 GHz) dual-polarization receiver with
ALMA Band 9 mixers. The SMT control system supports both dual-polarization
("2 IF mode"), and dual-polarization, dual-sideband observations ("4 IF mode"),
as well as OTF mapping. The new 12m will support ALMA Band 3 dual-polarization
SBS receiver (84-116 GHz) for this season.

Remote observing is available. Observers who plan to observe remotely must
supply fixed IP address(es) of the computer(s) that will be used during
observing on their Proposal Summary Sheet. Information about Remote Observing
can be viewed at: http://aro.as.arizona.edu/remote/remote.htm/. Graduate student
participation is especially encouraged. For further information about remote
observing and operational questions, please contact Tom Folkers, Operations
Manager at tfolkers@email.arizona.edu .

Proposers should consult the ARO website, http://aro.as.arizona.edu/, for
technical specifications and to download updated Proposal Summary Sheet
templates here: http://aro.as.arizona.edu/proposal_submission_information.htm .
Proposal candidates are required to list on the Proposal Summary Sheet their
requested observing blocks (LST ranges), dates on which they are NOT available
to observe, and dates in which sources in those observing blocks are within the
Sun-avoidance zone (44 degrees at the SMT).

Proposals should consist of:
1.  A Proposal Summary Sheet.
2.  A brief scientific and technical justification (no more than 2 pages).
3.  A source list with observing time requirements and justification, and/or
    tables, figures and references (no more than 1 page in total).

Electronic submissions will be accepted in PDF format ONLY. Scheduling of
successful proposals will be done according to availability of the receivers
requested. The final proposal pdf file should be emailed to
kuan@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw by midnight (23:59 pm CST) February 06, 2015 (Friday).


Kind regards,
Yi-Jehng Kuan

*NTHU Astronomy Colloquium*
Date:2015-02-06
Time:14:00-15:00

Title:
The Reversal of the Star-Formation Density Relation in High Redshift
Clusters

Abstract:
The star-formation density relation is one of the cleanest pieces of
evidence of the effect of environment on galaxy evolution. We are used to
the observations that clusters are dominated by "red and dead" galaxies
especially at the densest cluster cores. As all galaxies must have been
"star-forming" at some time, this indicates that some feature of these
dense regions has acted to transform star-forming galaxies into the passive
populations in the past. On the other hand, the fraction of star-forming
galaxies in clusters indeed increases rapidly with redshift. However, this
vigorously star-forming systems are generally found on the outskirts of
clusters with z<1. Only recently, we started to identify strongly star
forming galaxies at the very center of the cluster cores at z~1.5 and
beyond. Thus, at these redshifts, the star-formation rate does not drop at
the densest region anymore. In the talk, I will report our result of the
extensive dusty star forming galaxies found in one massive cluster at
z=1.46 using the SCUBA2 850um data, and discuss its impact to the formation
of massive elliptical galaxies in clusters.

Topic:         What do we know about barred spiral galaxies?
Time:         2/2 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
I will briefly introduce some interesting aspects of gas dynamics and star formation in barred spiral galaxies. The central bar not only drives the gas into the center of the galaxy, but also excites spiral density waves in the outer part. Questions such as what are differences between them and grand-design spirals will be discussed.


*** Colloquium ***

Speaker:    Sara Beck (Tel Aviv University)
Topic:         The Youngest Globular Clusters: Where They Are Born and How They Survive
Time:         2/4 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
Where are globular clusters forming today? Not in our Galaxy; none of the protoclusters in the Milky Way is likely to survive as a bound cluster.  The candidate proto-globulars in the nearby Universe are the optically hidden, deeply embedded super star clusters in starburst galaxies, where hundreds or thousands of OB stars form in volumes less than a few parsec across. Star formation eficiency (SFE) in these sources is 40 − 70%, more than an order of magnitude greater than in our Galaxy; why so high? OB stars create energetic feedback that will work to disperse the cluster: how do the clusters survive, and what do they do to the surrounding clouds? We report on SMA observations that may show how to drive high SFE, and infrared spectra of metal lines with true resolution of 3 − 5 km/sec that trace the kinematics of the ionized gas and its interaction with the ambient molecular material.
