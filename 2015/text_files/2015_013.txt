Dear Colleagues:

This is a pre-announcement of an upcoming Call for Proposals for
the Submillimeter Array (SMA), the reconfigurable interferometric array
of eight 6-m antennas on Mauna Kea jointly built and operated by the
Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory and the Academia Sinica
Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics. The array operates in the
230 GHz, 345 GHz and 420 GHz bands.

The proposal deadline for the coming 2015A semester (16 May 2015 -
15 Nov. 2015) is on 12 Feb 2015. The SMA Observer Center website =
(http://sma1.sma.hawaii.edu) is expected to be open for
proposal submission on 20 Jan. 2015.

Best wishes,
Qizhou Zhang
SMA TAC Chair=
