Speaker:        Thomas Greve (University College London)
Topic:          Dense molecular gas in local ULIRGs
Time:           8/24 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
The population of nearby of gas-rich and highly dust-obscured Ultra Luminous
Infrared Galaxies (ULIRGs) provides us with a unique opportunity to study the
physical processes governing star formation in kinematically violent and
radiation-harsh environments.

As part of the Herschel Comprehensive (U)LIRG Emission Survey (HerCULES) we
have obtained the full CO rotational ladder for a sample of 26 (U)LIRGs.  In
addition, we have compiled our ground-based spectral line observations of this
sample, as well as all available data from the literature, of crucial dense gas
tracers such as CS, HCN, and HCO+ (and in some cases their isotopologues).

I will discuss some of the first results coming out of this unique data-set,
from simple star formation relations to multi-phased Large Velocity Gradient
(LVG) radiative transfer models that allow us to disentangle different
molecular gas phases and possibly different molecular gas heating mechanisms in
these galaxies.

Topic:          Space Warps - crowd sourcing the discovery of gravitational lenses
Time:           8/26 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Strong gravitational lenses are useful for probing dark matter and
cosmology. Gravitational lenses are rare and present significant
challenges to find.  Current algorithms are not efficient enough in
finding lenses automatically. Better techniques are critical for
discovering lenses from ongoing and planned large imaging surveys.
Understanding the selection function of the lens samples is required
for doing statistical studies.

I will talk about Space Warps, a citizen science project to find
strong gravitational lenses. I will discuss how the system works and
how we determine the completeness and purity of our lens samples. The
first lens search in Space Warps was done with the CFHT Legacy Survey
(CFHTLS) data. I will present the results from this search.
