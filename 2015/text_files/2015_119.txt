TIFR, Pune, India)
Topic: Do the Fundamental Constants Change with Time?
Time: Jun 11, 3pm
Place: S4-1013, NCU

Abstract:
Comparisons between the redshifts of spectral lines from
cosmologically-distant galaxies can be used to probe temporal changes in
low-energy fundamental constants like the fine structure constant and the
proton-electron mass ratio. In this article, I review the results from, and
the advantages and disadvantages of, the best techniques using this
approach, before focusing on a new method, based on conjugate satellite OH
lines, that appears to be less affected by systematic effects and hence
holds much promise for the future.

*NCU Astronomy Colloquium*
Speaker: Dr. Huang Shan (ASIAA)
Topic: HIghMass - High HI mass, HI-rich galaxies at z ~ 0
Time: Jun 12, 2pm
Place: S4-1013, NCU

Abstract:

I will present the study of a set of exceptional HI sources identified in
the 40% ALFALFA extragalactic HI survey catalog as being both HI massive
and having high gas fractions for their stellar masses: the HIghMass galaxy
sample. We analyze multiwavelength data to understand the nature of their
relatively underluminous disks in optical and to test whether their high
gas fractions can be tracked to higher dark matter halo spin parameters or
late gas accretion.
