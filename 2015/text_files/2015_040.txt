Hey Wei-Hao,

    Here is our call for proposals for 2015B. Please distribute it to the
ASIAA community.

-----

      The CFHT call for proposals for the 2015B period will open Febuary
20th 2015 at 23:59 UTC and end March 20th 2015 23:59 UTC. You can submit
proposals here:

http://northstar.cfht.hawaii.edu/proposal

Please make sure you have a look at the specific information for the 2015B
semester. It can be found here:

http://cfht.hawaii.edu/en/science/Proposals/

All agencies are invited to encourage their community to submit snapshot
programs. These programs must be able to accept an Image Quality worse than
1.2" or significant levels of extinction. Snapshot programs are used not
only during bad weather conditions but also to fill gaps in the queues when
no A, B or C program are available or suitable. Snapshot programs are not
counted toward an agency's allocation.

Daniel Devost.
