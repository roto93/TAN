Postdoctoral Position in Studies
of Obscured Starbursts and AGNs


Institution Name: Chalmers University of Technology

Email address for inquiries: saalto@chalmers.se


Applications are invited for a postdoc position, with a duration
of up to 2 years, to work with Professor Susanne Aalto
(saalto@chalmers.se) on a project on obscured starbursts and AGNs
through a range of observational but potentially also theoretical
projects relating to the properties of deeply embedded galaxy
nuclei and their associated in- and outflows.
You will be working in an extended network of collaboration
consisting of senior researchers and postdocs - primarily across
Europe (Sweden, UK, France, Spain, Italy, Germany, The Netherlands)
but also involving partners in the US, Japan and Taiwan.


Applicants should have a PhD in an area of astrophysics that is
relevant to the research programme outlined above. Experience in
observational sub-millimetre astronomy, preferably in the areas
of extragalactic star-formation and AGNs is an advantage.


Deadline for application: February 6 2015


Applications should be made online via this website:

http://www.chalmers.se/en/about-chalmers/vacancies/?rmpage=job&rmjob=2690

(The above ad hints at a three year limit after PhD for the position
  â€“ but this does not apply for this postdoc position.)
