*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Shih-Ping Lai (NTHU)
Topic:         In Quest of the Youngest Protostars and Protoplanetary Disks
Time:         3/11 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
Finding the youngest protostars and proto-planetary disks and investigating their environment is a critical step toward fully understanding of star formation.  In this talk, I will present the work my students and I have done on this subject. (1) Discovering a extremely young Keplerian disk around Class 0 protostar VLA1623A with SMA and ALAM data (Murillo et al, 2013), (2) Introducing "Multi-D" - a new method we developed for identifying faint YSO population in Giant Molecular Clouds using multi-band photometry data (Hsieh & Lai 2013), and (3) Molecular line observations showing that Very Low Luminosity Objects (VeLLOs) are most likely young protostars (Hsieh et al, 2015, in print).
