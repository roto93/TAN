A Workshop for Friends of NanoSIMS

Academia Sinica, Taipei

The workshop for Friends of NanoSIMS is a one day event held at Academia 
Sinica on Tuesday, 28th April 2015. SIMS stands for Secondary Ion Mass 
Spectrometry and is a powerful tool used in cosmo, geo, life, and 
material sciences to discover Natureâ€™s big secrets in small places.

The workshop aims to bring together our current collaborators and 
interested people to share our experience and discuss future projects. 
As a special guest, we invited the developer of the NanoSIMS, Dr. 
Francois Hillion (Cameca, France), to give a lecture on the instrument 
and its application.

You are cordially invited to participate in this event. A preliminary 
programme, as well as more information on the venue can be found on our 
website: https://events.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/workshop/20150428/. 
Registration deadline is Friday, 24th April 2015.
