*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Erick Young (SOFIA Science Center)
Topic:         SOFIA, The Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy -- Science Highlights and Observing Opportunities
Time:         3/25 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
The Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA), is a highly modified Boeing 747-SP aircraft that has a 2.7-m telescope. Flying above more than 99% of the absorbing water vapor in the Earth's atmosphere, SOFIA provides access to otherwise unobservable wavelengths in the infrared to the worldwide astronomical community. SOFIA entered the Full Operations phase in February 2014, and is supporting observing proposals from astronomers all over the world. The project is an international collaboration between the US and Germany and has required high levels of coordination and communication among the many partners. The airplane has recently returned from an extensive periodic maintenance, and has resumed the science observation program. The plan for 2015 includes support for six science instruments, a deployment to the Southern Hemisphere, and support for an occultation of Pluto. This talk will cover some of the technical challenges in making SOFIA a reality, and will h!
ighlight some of the recent science results.  Observing opportunities for Cycle 4 are described.
