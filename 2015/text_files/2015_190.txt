Dear colleagues,

I am forwarding the first announcement of the Cosmic Dust
meeting in Japan next year.

MEETING TITLE:
Cosmic Dust

WEBSITE:
https://www.cps-jp.org/~dust/

VENUE:
Tohoku University
Aramaki aza Aoba 6-3, Aoba-ku
Sendai 980-8578
JAPAN

DATE:
Monday, August 15 =E2=80=93 Friday, August 19, 2016

OBJECTIVES:
This series of Cosmic Dust meetings aims at finding a consensus among
experts on the formation and evolution of cosmic dust: where it comes from
and where it goes. The meeting is organized by dust freaks who are very
enthusiastic not only to make the goal achievable but also to establish a
dust community across every scientifically relevant discipline for the
development of cosmic dust research. For this reason, the primary objective
of the meeting is to bring together professionals who deal with cosmic dust
as well as provide an opportunity for participants to develop interpersonal
relationships and scientific interactions among themselves.

SCOPE:
All kinds of cosmic dust such as
=E2=80=A2 intergalactic dust
=E2=80=A2 circumnuclear dust
=E2=80=A2 interstellar dust
=E2=80=A2 protoplanetary disk dust
=E2=80=A2 debris disk dust
=E2=80=A2 cometary dust
=E2=80=A2 interplanetary dust
=E2=80=A2 circumplanetary dust
=E2=80=A2 stellar nebular condensates
=E2=80=A2 presolar grains
=E2=80=A2 micrometeorites
=E2=80=A2 meteoroids
=E2=80=A2 meteors
=E2=80=A2 regolith particles
=E2=80=A2 planetary aerosols
are the subject of discussion. The meeting is open for any aspects of dust
research by means of different methods of studies (in-situ and laboratory
measurements, astronomical observations, laboratory and numerical
simulations, theoretical modeling, data analyses, etc.). All dust-related
topics, for example, the formation of molecules and their reactions on and
their desorption from the surface of dust particles, are also welcome.
Publishing the proceedings of this meeting is currently planned as a
special issue of a peer-reviewed journal, while paper submission to the
proceedings is not obligatory.

ADMISSIONS APPLICATION:
Please complete online meeting application at the CPS website in order to
attend the meeting. The deadline for the application is May 13, 2016, 11:59
p.m. Japan Standard Time (GMT+09:00). Because the number of participants is
limited to a maximum of 50, the online application does not guarantee
admission to the meeting. Participants will be determined at the discretion
of the SOC and all applicants will be notified of the admissions decision
by May 31, 2016. Priority will be given to those who contribute to oral or
poster sessions and retain enthusiasm for discussions throughout the
meeting. For further details, please visit the Cosmic Dust website.
https://www.cps-jp.org/~dust/Application.html

REGISTRATION FEE:
The early bird rate of 10,000 JPY is available for those who complete both
admissions application and abstract submission by April 30, 2016. The
registration fee for those who complete admissions application on and after
May 1, 2016 is 15,000 JPY. While no payment is required at the time of
admissions application and abstract submission, the registration fee should
be paid by cash on arrival at the venue. No matter what circumstances are
specified, the registration fee will not be waived.

BEST POSTER AWARD:
The best poster award will be given to the most excellent content and
presentation of a poster at the Cosmic Dust meeting, although higher
priorities are given to posters by students and junior scientists. The
award winner will be announced at the end of the meeting.

IMPORTANT DATES:
30 April 2016, Deadline for Early-Bird Application
13 May 2016, Deadline for Admissions Application
31 May 2016, Notification of Admissions Decision

BRIEF HISTORY:
The Cosmic Dust meeting started in 2006 as a session called =E2=80=9CCosmic=
 Dust=E2=80=9D
of the 3rd AOGS (Asia-Oceania Geoscience Society) annual meeting in
Singapore. Dust freaks have kept on organizing the session at subsequent
AOGS meetings in Korea (2008), India (2010), and Taiwan (2011). The Cosmic
Dust series has been recognized as the most successful session of the AOGS
Planetary Sciences Section. In 2012, the time was ripe to be free from
organizing restrictions on the AOGS meeting. From that time on, the Cosmic
Dust meeting is totally independent of any international conference. The
past meetings on Cosmic Dust have been held in a relaxed and joyful
atmosphere. So will be the coming one!=EF=BF=BC

*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________
Speaker:        Christy Tremonti (University of Wisconsin–Madison)
Topic:          Star Formation-Driven Galactic Winds: Physical Properties and Implications for Galaxy Evolution
Time:           11/5 (Thursday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
A central issue in galaxy evolution is understanding the 'baryon cycle', namely how gas is accreted onto galaxies and expelled in galactic winds.  I will describe some on-going work to measure galactic winds at both low and intermediate redshift using UV/optical absorption line spectroscopy.  I will show how outflow velocities scale with galaxy physical properties such as stellar mass, star formation rate, and morphology and I will consider the implications of these trends. Finally, I will discuss star formation feedback at its most extreme and its role in shaping the progenitors of today’s giant elliptical galaxies.
