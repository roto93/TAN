Dear Prospective ALMA Users,

Call for Proposals for Cycle 3 has been issued:

The ALMA Director, on behalf of the Joint ALMA Observatory (JAO) and the =
partner organizations in East Asia, Europe, and North America, is =
pleased to announce the ALMA Early Science Cycle 3 Call for Proposals =
(CfP) for scientific observations that will be scheduled from October =
2015 to September 2016.

The ALMA Observatory includes an array of fifty 12-m antennas for long =
baseline interferometric observations (the 12-m Array), and the Atacama =
Compact Array (ACA, also known as the Morita Array) composed of twelve =
7- m antennas for short baseline interferometric observations (7-m =
Array) and four 12-m antennas for single-dish observations (Total Power =
or TP Array).

Cycle 3 observations provide an exciting opportunity for science from =
this unique world-class facility. They include standard and non-standard =
modes (see below). ALMA has entered into a phase where =
investigator-driven science observations dominate activities while =
continued improvements and developments are also explored.
