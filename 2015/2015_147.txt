Topic:          The Structure of Class 0 Protostars: BHR71 in Herschel View
Time:           8/10 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
We performed a comprehensive analysis of the Herschel spectra of BHR71,
an embedded Class 0 protostar. We recover 66 lines in the central
spaxel, and more than 700 lines are detected in all spaxels in PACS, and
SPIRE. The CO rotational diagram analysis shows four excitation
temperature components, 51 K, 153 K, 408 K, and 1053 K. Low-J CO lines
trace the outflow while the high-J CO lines are centered on the infrared
source.  The emissions of H2O traces the outflow on large scales, while
H2O emissions populate along the equatorial plane on small scale scales.
We model the structure of envelope using dust radiative transfer with
Hyperion to fit the spectral energy distribution (SED) observed by
Spitzer and Herschel.  The model incorporates rotational collapse and an
outer static envelope as well as outflow cavity and disk.  Our
exploration of parameter space shows that the evolution of collapsing
envelope can be constrained by Herschel spectra and the structure of
outflow cavity plays a critical role in the shorter wavelength.  We
found the density profile of cavity with a power law with a constant
inner region can reproduce the observations.  The high central
luminosity in the best-fit model shows a hint of a higher accretion rate
than the rate derived from collapse model.  Our model constrains BHR71
to have an age of 29000 years and a total dust mass of 0.04 Solar mass.
