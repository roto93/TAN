********************************
Call for Proposals of KaVA (KVN and VERA Array)
Deadline:  May 26, 2015, 08:00 UT.
*********************************

Dear Colleagues.

We invite proposals for the open use observations of the KaVA, a joint VLBI array 
of the KVN (Korean VLBI Network) and the VERA (VLBI exploration of Radio 
Astrometry). The joint array consists of three 21-m KVN telescopes and 
four 20-m VERA telescopes, with baseline lengths ranging from 300 km to 2300 km.

Same as the last semester, this open-use call will be based on risk-share, and provide 
VLBI observations at 22GHz and 43GHz for astronomers who are affiliated to universities 
or institutes in Korea, Japan, China and Taiwan. We can support astronomers who are 
not familiar with VLBI technique in the preparation of proposals, scheduling, and data 
analysis. Proposers from China and/or Taiwan are requested to include at least one 
collaborator from VERA or KVN. If it is difficult to find the collaborator from VERA or KVN, 
we can support to find them.
The contact address for the support is kavaprop (at-mark) kasi.re.kr.

Observations will be conducted with single polarization (LCP) and 1-Gbps data rate. 
The total available observation time is up to 250 hours and the observations will be 
scheduled between August 15, 2015 and January 15, 2016. The maximum observing 
time per proposal is 48 hours. The deadline of submission is at 08:00 UT May 26, 2015.  
More detailed information on the KaVA call-for-proposal can be found in

If you have any questions, please send an email to kavaprop (at-mark)kasi.re.kr

Sincerely,

                      Hyun-Goo Kim
                       Director of Radio Astronomy Division, KASI
                         and

                      Director of Mizusawa VLBI Observatory, NAOJ
