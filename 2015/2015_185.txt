*** ASIAA/NTU Joint Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________
Speaker:        Pierre Cox (ALMA observatory)
Topic:          Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA): Status and Development
Time:           10/19 (Monday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           physics 104
Abstract:
The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) is an aperture synthesis interferometer that currently operates from wavelengths of 3 mm to 350 microns with up to sixty six (66) array elements: fifty four (54) of 12-m diameter and twelve (12) of 7-m diameter. The array is located at the ALMA Array Operations Site (AOS) on the Chajnator plateau (at an altitude of about 5000 meters) in the Atacama desert in northern Chile. While the antennas and most of the hardware for the receivers are on site, array capabilities are still expanding and the observatory is ramping up towards full operations. Early science observations have been ongoing since October 2011 and ALMA started the fourth cycle of Early Science observations. Many exciting, fundamental results have already been obtained. I will review the current status of the project, the array performance, testing, and development projects and present a selection of some of the most exciting scientific results from the sola!
 r system to the early universe. In short, I will present ALMA: past, present and future.

Topic:          What's the universe made of?
Time:           10/20 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           Physics 104
Abstract:
What is the nature of dark energy and dark matter? I will describe two astronomical experiments based on strong gravitational lensing that can address this question in a novel way. In the first experiment, strong gravitational lenses where the background source is variable in time and the foreground deflector is a massive galaxy are used as cosmic "standard rods". I will illustrate recent advances in modelling techniques and data quality that enable a 6-7% measurement of constraints on distance from a single gravitational lens. I will show that results from just two systems yield constraints on the equation of state of dark energy and flatness comparable to those obtained with the best probes. The second experiment uses the flux ratios between multiple images of gravitationally lensed quasars to detect the presence of dark subhalos independent of their stellar content. This tests a fundamental prediction of the cold dark matter model, i.e. that galaxies should be surrounded !
 by large numbers of dark satellite subhalos. Proof that such satellites do not exist would force a revision of the model in favor of more exotic alternatives like warm dark matter. I will show first results from this experiment based on Keck-Adaptive Optics observations.  I will then conclude by discussing the bright prospects of studies of the dark sector using gravitational lensing.

Topic:          The Grism Lens-Amplified Survey from Space (GLASS): Dissecting reionization, z~2 galaxies, and dense environments
Time:           10/21 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
The Grism Lens-Amplified Survey from Space (GLASS) is a large HST cycle-21 program targeting 10 massive galaxy clusters with extensive HST imaging from CLASH and the Frontier Field Initiative. The program consists of 140 primary and 140 parallel orbits of near-infrared WCF3 and optical ACS grism observations, which result in spatially resolved spectroscopy of thousands of galaxies. GLASS has three primary science drivers although a wide variety of other science investigations are possible with the public GLASS data (e.g. SN 'Refsdal'). The key science goals of GLASS are to: 1) shed light on the epoch of reionization, by measuring the lyman alpha optical depth at z>6; 2) Study gas accretion, star formation, and outflows by spatially mapping resolved star formation and determine metallicity gradients from emission lines of galaxies at 1.3<z<2.3; 3) Explore the environmental dependence of galaxy evolution using the first comprehensive census of spatially resolved star formation!
  in dense environments, i.e., the cluster cores as well as the cluster infall regions. I will present the first results from GLASS.
