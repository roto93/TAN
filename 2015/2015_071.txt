Speaker:    Hung-Yi Pu and Kiyun Yun (ASIAA and Yonsei University)
Topic:         Odyssey: for Science and Education - Part II
Time:         3/30 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
During last summer,  we developed a new Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)-based code, Odyssey, for ray-tracing computation in curved space-time. In this talk, we will  (1) introduce how Odyssey works,  (2) Education: show real time photon trajectories when black hole spin or inclination angle changes, by using the educational software we designed, (3) Science: demonstrate the related physics behind time-dependent event (e.x., orbiting hot spot ), and general relativistic radiative transfer (GRRT).


*** ASIAA/NTU Joint Colloquium ***

*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Chongsin Gou (Advanced Rocket Research Center; National Chiao Tung University)
Topic:         Rockets â€“ the Key to Space, Can Taiwan Make It?
Time:         4/1 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
In this talk, I will briefly review the current status of global space technology and application, which focuses on the use of satellites and satellite launching capability. Analyses show that Taiwan is highly justified to develop space technology in terms of her strength in economy and military spending by sending satellites into orbit to serve its people for peaceful/economic purpose. I will also propose what Taiwan should do in the near future to cultivate its own niche space technology which will benefit economic and scientific development. These include nano/micro satellites in LEO and skim satellite in VLEO, among others. Then followed by brief introduction of history, classification and pros/cons of rocket propulsion technology. This explains why ARRC is currently devoted to developing hybrid rocket propulsion technology. Its role in future space exploration is also outlined.

In addition, I will share some recent studies done by a joint work between Prof. Nick Thomas (University of Bern, Switzerland) and my group about gas/dust jet plume simulation of CG/67P comet which were recently rendezvous by Rosetta satellite launched by ESA.
