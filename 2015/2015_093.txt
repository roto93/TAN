*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Masashi Hazumi (High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK), Japan)
Topic:         Roadmap for CMB Polarization Measurements with POLARBEAR, Simons Array and LiteBIRD
Time:         4/22 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:          R1203
Abstract:
Cosmological inflation, which is the leading hypothesis to resolve the problems in the Big Bang theory, predicts that primordial gravitational waves were created during the inflationary era.  Measurements of polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) are known as the best probe to detect the primordial gravitational waves. POLARBEAR is designed to measure CMB polarization with an array of TES bolometers.  It has been in operation since 2012 in the Atacama desert in northern Chile. The main scientific objective of POLARBEAR is to search for primordial gravitational waves imprinted as the “B-mode” in the CMB polarization maps. Another important goal is to measure a spatial distortion of the CMB polarization maps due to gravitational lensing, which is a very sensitive probe for the large-scale distribution of matter in the early universe and will constrain the sum of neutrino masses. The Simons Array is an expansion of the POLARBEAR. It will consist of an array o!
f three 3.5m telescopes each coupled to a multichroic TES bolometer pixel, so that it will provide very powerful foreground rejection capability and much deeper observation. Finally, LiteBIRD is a satellite project to map CMB polarization over the full sky at large angular scales with ultimate precision. The LiteBIRD proposal was submitted to JAXA in February 2015 with the target launch in Japanese fiscal year 2022. The scientific objective of LiteBIRD is to test all the representative inflation models that satisfy single-field slow-roll conditions and lie in the large-field regime. To this end, the requirement on the precision of the tensor-to-scalar ratio, r, at LiteBIRD is equal to or less than 0.001, a hundred times better than the current constraint.

********************************
Call for Proposals of KaVA (KVN and VERA Array)
Deadline:  May 26, 2015, 08:00 UT.
*********************************

Dear Colleagues.

We invite proposals for the open use observations of the KaVA, a joint VLBI array 
of the KVN (Korean VLBI Network) and the VERA (VLBI exploration of Radio 
Astrometry). The joint array consists of three 21-m KVN telescopes and 
four 20-m VERA telescopes, with baseline lengths ranging from 300 km to 2300 km.

Same as the last semester, this open-use call will be based on risk-share, and provide 
VLBI observations at 22GHz and 43GHz for astronomers who are affiliated to universities 
or institutes in Korea, Japan, China and Taiwan. We can support astronomers who are 
not familiar with VLBI technique in the preparation of proposals, scheduling, and data 
analysis. Proposers from China and/or Taiwan are requested to include at least one 
collaborator from VERA or KVN. If it is difficult to find the collaborator from VERA or KVN, 
we can support to find them.
The contact address for the support is kavaprop (at-mark) kasi.re.kr.

Observations will be conducted with single polarization (LCP) and 1-Gbps data rate. 
The total available observation time is up to 250 hours and the observations will be 
scheduled between August 15, 2015 and January 15, 2016. The maximum observing 
time per proposal is 48 hours. The deadline of submission is at 08:00 UT May 26, 2015.  
More detailed information on the KaVA call-for-proposal can be found in 
http://kava.kasi.re.kr/contents/proposal_info.php?mid=020101

A Workshop for Friends of NanoSIMS

Academia Sinica, Taipei

The workshop for Friends of NanoSIMS is a one day event held at Academia 
Sinica on Tuesday, 28th April 2015. SIMS stands for Secondary Ion Mass 
Spectrometry and is a powerful tool used in cosmo, geo, life, and 
material sciences to discover Nature’s big secrets in small places.

The workshop aims to bring together our current collaborators and 
interested people to share our experience and discuss future projects. 
As a special guest, we invited the developer of the NanoSIMS, Dr. 
Francois Hillion (Cameca, France), to give a lecture on the instrument 
and its application.

You are cordially invited to participate in this event. A preliminary 
programme, as well as more information on the venue can be found on our 
website: https://events.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/workshop/20150428/. 
Registration deadline is Friday, 24th April 2015.

Dear Pin-Gao,

I'm now organizing a DTA workshop in Tokyo,
and am wondering whether or not it would be possible to ask you to
circulate the ad to people in Taiwan.
The URL is http://th.nao.ac.jp/meeting/dta2015a_planet/

We will provide (some of) participants with the local support.

Thanks, Yasu

*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Suklima Niyogi (Leiden University)
Topic:         Massive stars and cosmic interstellar dust
Time:         4/29 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:          R1203
Abstract:
Dust is a key component of the interstellar medium (ISM) of galaxies. Dust grains form primarily in the ejecta of the stars. The two main sources of dust are the winds of low-to intermediate mass (< 8 Msun) stars and the rapidly evolving high-mass stars (> 8 Msun). In our Milky Way Galaxy, low-mass stars mainly dominate the injection of dust into the ISM during the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase. But the origin of dust in galaxies in the very early universe is controversial. The observed high abundance of dust in galaxies in the early Universe has often been taken to imply that rapidly evolving, high- mass stars are an important dust source. To quantify the dust properties (e.g. mass, composition), I analyzed the spectral energy distribution (SED) of a sample of Luminous blue variables (LBVs) and B[e] supergiants in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). For this purpose, I have used spectroscopic and photometric observational data from Spitzer Space Telescope and Herschel O!
bservatory. I computed the model spectra of these stars by using radiative transfer code MCMax. From the best fit models, I derived the time-averaged dust mass-loss rates of these high-mass stars and compared with the dust mass-loss rates of low-mass AGB stars. Based on this analysis, I speculate that high-mass stars are an important dust source in the ISM of the LMC and further detailed investigation is required.
