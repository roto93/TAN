Topic:         Cosmic Web Reconstruction through Density Ridges
Time:         6/1 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:          R1203
Abstract:
The detection and characterization of filamentary structures in the cosmic web allows cosmologists to constrain parameters that dictates the evolution of the Universe. To detect cosmic filaments, we propose a density ridge model and introduce the subspace constrained mean shift algorithm. The density ridges are collection of curves that represent high density regions. By comparing density ridges to both smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulation and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we have found that several properties of galaxies, including principal axes, color, stellar mass and size, are influenced by filaments.
