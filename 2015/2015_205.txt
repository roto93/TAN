*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________
Speaker:        Frank Shu (ASIAA)
Topic:          Astrophysics of Molten Salt Breeder Reactors: Building a Nuclear Reactor Better than the Sun
Time:           12/1 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           1203
Abstract:
Climate change is real, here, and potentially catastrophic in its effect.   We argue that the scale of the transformation needed to mitigate climate change requires breakthroughs in current technologies, most importantly, in new forms of fission reactors that are
(1) safe in their inherent design,
(2) sustainable in terms of meeting future energy demand for several centuries as well as having an acceptable solution for nuclear waste disposal,
(3) secure in terms of weapons proliferation,
(4) superior in competitive cost relative to other alternatives.

We focus on one design – a two-fluid molten salt breeder reactor that uses the thorium fuel cycle – that has all four attributes, as well as a pathway to convert smoothly from our current unsustainable dependence on light-water reactors that use the once-through uranium fuel cycle.  We argue how a spherical reactor can be understood in terms of astrophysical principles that govern the equation of state of the matter, mechanical structure, energy generation (with fission replacing fusion), and heat transport inside stars.  An important difference is that engineering solutions can avoid evolution away from the so-called zero-age main-sequence.  A subtext of the talk is that astrophysicists with a training in systems-thinking can bring unique technical insights to the challenges of climate-change mitigation and energy transformation.  However, we also need to appreciate that the needed changes from business as usual are not only in scientific approach, but must deal with ec!
 onomic, political, and social realities.  Climate change is a problem that affects all segments of society, and it cannot be solved without the cooperation of important stakeholders, in particular, the current suppliers of world primary energy (in descending order of market share in 2012): fossil fuels (81.7%), biofuels (10.0%), nuclear power (4.8%), hydropower (2.4%), and wind/solar/geothermal (1.1%).


*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________
Speaker:        Teppei Okumura (Kavli IPMU)
Topic:          Observational and theoretical studies of large-scale structure
of the Universe using galaxy redshift surveys
Time:           12/2 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Probing the nature of dark energy, which drives the acceleration of
the cosmic expansion, is one of the most important issues in
cosmology. The large-scale structure of the Universe, which can be
traced by a galaxy survey, is considered as one of the most powerful
cosmological tools for such a purpose because one can obtain
3-dimensional matter distribution, while CMB probes the 2-d projection
along the line of sight. In this talk, first I will present current
observational constraints on dark energy properties from galaxy
surveys, focusing on baryon acoustic oscillations and redshift-space
distortions. Next I will show some issues which occur when one tries
to extract cosmological information from galaxy surveys, which implies
necessity to develop more accurate theoretical templates for the
galaxy clustering. Then I will present a new theoretical formalism I
have been developing to predict the galaxy clustering in redshift
space. Finally, I will address how such a theoretical formalism with
high precision becomes critically important when one wants to apply it
for future, precision galaxy surveys, such as the Subaru PFS survey.

 Dear All,

 On behalf of the Director of the Nobeyama Radio Observatory, I am =
sending you this information
on the call for the proposals with the Nobeyama 45-m telescope =
(short-term proposal up to 20 hours).
The deadline is December 10. A new multi-beam receiver FOREST is offered =
in a shared-risk basis.
The Nobeyama Observatory will support travel/lodging cost in Japan for =
PIs in foreign institutes.
