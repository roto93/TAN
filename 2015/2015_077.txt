*NCU Astronomy Colloquium*
Speaker: Dr. Chi-Yi Chou(ASIAA)
Topic:The Subaru Prime Focus Spectrograph Project in ASIAA
Time: Apr,10, 2pm
Place: S4-1013, NCU

Abstract:
The Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS) is a new fiber based
optical/near-infrared multi-fiber spectrograph designed for the prime focus
of the 8.2m Subaru telescope. PFS shares the same wide field corrector for
the Hyper Suprime Cam on Subaru telescope providing a 1.3 deg2 FOV. The
expected spectral resolving power is 3000 and 5000 for the low and mid
resolution mode, respectively. PFS is composed of four major subsystems: 1.
the prime focus instrument which locates at the telescope prime focus
containing 2400 motorized fibers; 2. fiber cable system that connects the
prime focus instrument and the spectrohraph system; 3. spectrograph system
that disperses light from the fibers; and 4. the metrology camera system
that locates at the cassegrain focus monitoring the position of motorized
fibers. ASIAA is in charge of designing and manufacturing of the prime
focus instrument and the metrology camera systems. I will start with
general aspects of this project (e.g., purpose, science goals, comparison
to other similar projects), and followed by brief introduction of the
subsystems. In the end I will share the current status of our recent work.
