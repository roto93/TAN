Dear Yi-Jehng,

Would you please help circulate the following conference information?
Thank you.

Dear Colleague,

This is the 1st announcement for the *IAU Symposium 323 - Planetary
nebulae: Multi-wavelength probes of stellar and galactic evolution *to be
held on *October 10-14, 2016, in Beijing, China*. The Symposium will
encompass all aspects of the impact and importance of planetary nebulae
(PNe) on stellar and galactic evolution. In particular, we expect to cover
the following topics:

- New challenges to surveys of PNe in the Local Group

- PNe as a versatile laboratory of dust and molecular studies

- From the asymptotic giant branch to the white dwarf stellar phases

- The connection between binary evolution and the PN phenomena

- Planets around evolved stars and their impact on PN formation

- PNe in nearby galaxies: probing chemical evolution and galactic dynamics

- PNe outside of the local group: Challenges to observing and interpret
distant PNe



We also expect discussion on the challenges of new and future
instrumentation as applied to the field of PNe.



More information will be posted on the *IAU Commission H3 Planetary
Nebulae* web
page at http://ast.noao.edu/activities/pn-commission/, and on the
conference's home page http://162.105.156.249/IAUS323/.



We hope to see a broad participation to this Symposium!

Xiaowei Liu, Letizia Stanghellini, and Amanda Karakas (SOC co-Chairs)
