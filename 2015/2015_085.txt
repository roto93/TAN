Dear Colleagues,

Here is the official announcement of the BioComplex 2015 conference to be
held in the 1F Auditorium in ASIAA.  This is an event that aims to bring
researchers of diverse disciplines into one place to promote interactions
crossing the traditional boundaries. It is strongly recommended for anyone
who is interested in learning biologically interesting molecules in various
environments and their origins. Students who are looking for future
directions are especially encouraged to attend.

Cheers,

Sienny
