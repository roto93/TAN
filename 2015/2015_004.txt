Title: Star Formation Rates of the Magellanic Clouds Determined from
Massive Star Counts
Abstract:
We have used the IRSF Magellanic Clouds (MCs) Point Source Catalog to
identify candidates of massive main sequence stars in the MCs using
the criterion J-H < 0 (extinction corrected) and their corresponding
M_J magnitudes. The massive star counts and their main sequence
lifetimes are used to estimate average star formation rates in the
past ~10^7 yr. We discuss the uncertainties caused by photometric
degeneracies between main sequence massive stars and giant stars, and
binary stars. Using these massive star counts and assuming Salpeter's
initial mass function (IMF), we find average SFRs of ~0.37 and 0.12 M
yr^-1 for the LMC and SMC, respectively. If Kroupa’s IMF is adopted,
the SFRs will be ~18% lower. These SFRs are higher than those
determined from the H-alpha luminosities by 70-80% and a factor of ~3
for the LMC and SMC, respectively. We suggest that this discrepancy is
caused by the escape of stellar UV radiation from the disk planes of
the MCs. SFRs determined from combinations of H-alpha and infrared
emission may be still subject to the optical thickness of the
interstellar medium (ISM), especially for galaxies with tenuous ISM,
low metallicity and low dust content.
