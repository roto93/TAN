Astronomical Society of the Republic of China 2015 Scientific Assembly (ASROC2015) 
          National Ilan University, I-Lan May 22 ¡V 24, 2015 

The 2015 Scientific Assembly of the Astronomical Society of the Republic of China (ASROC2015) will be held at National Ilan University on May 22 (Friday) ¡V 24 (Sunday), 2015. This is the annual event for all astronomers and astrophysicists in Taiwan to present their most recent discoveries and observations, to report their latest research results and to exchange ideas, also to organize collaborations when desirable. Oral presentations and conference posters in all areas of astronomy and astrophysics are solicited. ASROC2015 is also an excellent venue for students, in particular graduate students, to present their research findings or progress from their thesis studies.

The meeting will include plenary talks, scientific and educational sessions, poster presentation, and a business meeting. The featured plenary speakers are 1) Dr. Timo Prusti from European Space Agency. 2) Dr. Joel Parker of Southwest Research Institute. Dr. Prusti is the project scientist of the GAIA mission and also the chair of the GAIA Science Team. He will give a plenary talk on ¡§Gaia Mission and Status¡¨. Dr. Parker is the director of the Planetary Science Directorate of Southwest Research Institute, will talk about ¡§The Rosetta Mission - Past, Present, and Future¡¨. 

In the Assembly, the Society will also present the 2nd Heaven Quest Award to Academician Dr. Typhoon Lee for his distinguished contribution to astronomical research, and the 2nd Heaven Talk Award to Director Wei-Hsin Sun of National Museum of Natural Science for his outstanding contribution to astronomy education and popularization of astronomy. In addition to the scientific agenda, the afternoon of May 23 (Sat) is reserved for group discussions or group excursions at choice; a conference banquet will be held later in the evening and all meeting participants are welcome to attend. Exhibitions of astronomical books and telescopes are also planned during the meeting. 

ASROC2015 website is now open for registration and abstract submission. The deadline for online registration is April 30 and for abstract submission, April 17. Participants of the scientific assembly should submit their abstracts and register on-line. A registration fee of NT$1,000 (NT$800 for students) should be paid on site. For more detailed information and update, please visit the ASROC2015 website at http://www.asroc.org.tw/asroc2015/en/.

Dear Prospective ALMA Users,

Call for Proposals for Cycle 3 has been issued:

The ALMA Director, on behalf of the Joint ALMA Observatory (JAO) and the =
partner organizations in East Asia, Europe, and North America, is =
pleased to announce the ALMA Early Science Cycle 3 Call for Proposals =
(CfP) for scientific observations that will be scheduled from October =
2015 to September 2016.

The ALMA Observatory includes an array of fifty 12-m antennas for long =
baseline interferometric observations (the 12-m Array), and the Atacama =
Compact Array (ACA, also known as the Morita Array) composed of twelve =
7- m antennas for short baseline interferometric observations (7-m =
Array) and four 12-m antennas for single-dish observations (Total Power =
or TP Array).

Cycle 3 observations provide an exciting opportunity for science from =
this unique world-class facility. They include standard and non-standard =
modes (see below). ALMA has entered into a phase where =
investigator-driven science observations dominate activities while =
continued improvements and developments are also explored.

Speaker:    Hung-Yi Pu and Kiyun Yun (ASIAA and Yonsei University)
Topic:         Odyssey: for Science and Education - Part II
Time:         3/30 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
During last summer,  we developed a new Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)-based code, Odyssey, for ray-tracing computation in curved space-time. In this talk, we will  (1) introduce how Odyssey works,  (2) Education: show real time photon trajectories when black hole spin or inclination angle changes, by using the educational software we designed, (3) Science: demonstrate the related physics behind time-dependent event (e.x., orbiting hot spot ), and general relativistic radiative transfer (GRRT).


*** ASIAA/NTU Joint Colloquium ***

Speaker:    Chao-Lin Kuo (Stanford)

Time:         3/31 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:20

*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Chongsin Gou (Advanced Rocket Research Center; National Chiao Tung University)
Topic:         Rockets â€“ the Key to Space, Can Taiwan Make It?
Time:         4/1 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
In this talk, I will briefly review the current status of global space technology and application, which focuses on the use of satellites and satellite launching capability. Analyses show that Taiwan is highly justified to develop space technology in terms of her strength in economy and military spending by sending satellites into orbit to serve its people for peaceful/economic purpose. I will also propose what Taiwan should do in the near future to cultivate its own niche space technology which will benefit economic and scientific development. These include nano/micro satellites in LEO and skim satellite in VLEO, among others. Then followed by brief introduction of history, classification and pros/cons of rocket propulsion technology. This explains why ARRC is currently devoted to developing hybrid rocket propulsion technology. Its role in future space exploration is also outlined.

In addition, I will share some recent studies done by a joint work between Prof. Nick Thomas (University of Bern, Switzerland) and my group about gas/dust jet plume simulation of CG/67P comet which were recently rendezvous by Rosetta satellite launched by ESA.
