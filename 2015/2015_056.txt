Hello,
Would you please help circulate the colloquium information with TAN?
thanks.

*NCU Astronomy Colloquium*
Speaker: Prof. Abe Shinsuke(Department of Aerospace Engineering, Nihon
University)
Topic:Orbit Determination of Meteoroids by MU Radar Meteor Head Echo
Observations
Time: Mar. 20, 2pm
Place: S4-1013, NCU

Abstract:
The various mass ranges of meteoroids ranging between 10^-15 and 10^15g are
continuously colliding with the Earth. Most of them are so called
micrometeoroids, micrometeorites or IDPs (Interplanetary Dust Particles)
whose diameters are estimated between 10 and several 100 micrometres. It is
indicated by radar, high-flying aircraft and zodiacal cloud observations
that a daily mass influx of meteoroids is ranging from 100 to 300 tones.
However, it is still a matter of finding parent bodies of most meteoroids,
while parent bodies for the most of major meteor showers have been
identified as comets or dormant comets. Their physical and chemical aspects
such as composition, structure as well as their origins are also poorly
known. The influx rate of interplanetary dusts and artificial space debris
onto the Earth's surface are essential for the human space activities.
Thus, it is very important to investigate influx, orbits and mechanical
strength of meteoroids that can be observed as meteors after interacting
with the upper atmosphere. High power large aperture (HPLA) radar
observation is a recent technique to provide useful information on meteor
influx and orbits, as well as interactions with the atmosphere. The recent
development of the technique carried out using the middle and upper
atmosphere radar (MU radar) of Kyoto University at Shigaraki (34.9N,
136.1S), which is large atmospheric VHF radar with 46.5 MHz frequency, 1 MW
output transmission power and 8330 m2 aperture array antenna, has
established very precise orbital determination from meteor head echoes.
More than 150,000 meteor orbits have been measured since 2009. In this
study, we present the physical quantities of meteoroids such as orbital
parameters, flux rate and ablation characteristics obtained from the MU
radar meteor head echo observations. The origin and internal structure of
meteoroids compared with comets, asteroids and space debris will be
discussed.

Orbit Determination of Meteoroids by MU Radar Meteor Head Echo Observations

ABE, Shinsuke
Associate Professor

The various mass ranges of meteoroids ranging between 10^-15 and
10^15g are continuously colliding with the Earth. Most of them are so
called micrometeoroids, micrometeorites or IDPs (Interplanetary Dust
Particles) whose diameters are estimated between 10 and several 100
micrometres. It is indicated by radar, high-flying aircraft and
zodiacal cloud observations that a daily mass influx of meteoroids is
ranging from 100 to 300 tones. However, it is still a matter of
finding parent bodies of most meteoroids, while parent bodies for the
most of major meteor showers have been identified as comets or dormant
comets. Their physical and chemical aspects such as composition,
structure as well as their origins are also poorly known. The influx
rate of interplanetary dusts and artificial space debris onto the
Earth's surface are essential for the human space activities.  Thus,
it is very important to investigate influx, orbits and mechanical
strength of meteoroids that can be observed as meteors after
interacting with the upper atmosphere.
High power large aperture (HPLA) radar observation is a recent
technique to provide useful information on meteor influx and orbits,
as well as interactions with the atmosphere. The recent development of
the technique carried out using the middle and upper atmosphere radar
(MU radar) of Kyoto University at Shigaraki (34.9N, 136.1S), which is
large atmospheric VHF radar with 46.5 MHz frequency, 1 MW output
transmission power and 8330 m2 aperture array antenna, has established
very precise orbital determination from meteor head echoes. More than
150,000 meteor orbits have been measured since 2009.  In this study,
we present the physical quantities of meteoroids such as orbital
parameters, flux rate and ablation characteristics obtained from the
MU radar meteor head echo observations. The origin and internal
