*NCU-Delta Young Astronomer Lectureship Award Lecture*

Speaker: Dr. Kevin Heng (Center for Space and Habitability,University of
Bern, Switzerland)
Topic: Exoplanetary Atmospheres in Eras
Time: Sep 10, 2pm
Place: S4-1013, NCU

Abstract:
The observational scrutiny of the atmospheres of exoplanets is now a
legitimate field of inquiry, which has motivated their theoretical study.
In this review talk, I will summarise and highlight the state of the art of
both observations and theory of exoplanetary atmospheres. The review is
organised into eras, starting from the birth of spectrophotometry to the
upcoming set of next-generation exoplanet hunters and characterisers. On
the observational side, I will review spectrophotometry, phase curves,
eclipse mapping, direct imaging and ultra-high-resolution spectroscopy. On
the theoretical side, I will review atmospheric radiation, chemistry and
circulation (fluid dynamics). I will discuss the problem of bright stars
and why we need the next-generation of exoplanet hunting machines (CHEOPS,
TESS and PLATO) to build up a better target list for atmospheric
characterisation. Finally, there will be a discussion of the habitable zone
and also how the conversations between the scientists from different
sub-disciplines need to be more constructive.
