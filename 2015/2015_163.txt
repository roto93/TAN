Post-Doctoral Researchers in Optical Time-Domain Astronomy -- National
Central University (Taiwan)

The Graduate Institute of Astronomy at National Central University (IANCU)
is seeking qualified candidates for two post-doctoral researchers to work
in two different projects. IANCU owns and operates the Lulin Observatory in
central Taiwan. IANCU is actively participating in the "intermediate
Palomar Transit Factory" (iPTF) project and the "Global Relay of
Observatories Watching Transients Happen" (GROWTH) project. IANCU is also
expected to join the "Zwicky Transient Facility" (ZTF) in near future. One
post-doc position is responsible to robotize the small telescopes at Lulin
Observatory in order to meet the observational requirement for GROWTH. The
candidate for this position will also need to participate in the research
involving asteroids, variable stars and transients using the data from iPTF
(and ZTF), GROWTH and LOT. The second position will be focused on the
research of variable stars in stellar clusters and local group galaxies.
This position requires frequent visits to observatories in Taiwan and
around the world for imaging and spectroscopic observations, as well as
develop data reduction pipelines. Skills on spectroscopic reductions and
extracting radial velocities is strongly preferred.

Applicants must have a degree in PhD (or expected to receive PhD before 30
October 2015) during application. The applicants should also have
experience and background in observation with optical telescopes and
programming (c or python). A good oral communication in Mandarin Chinese is
preferred, but not required. Initial duration of the positions is two
years, and extendable to third year depending on the performance of the
candidates and availability of funding. Please sent a CV, a list of
publication and a research plan, together with three reference letters, by
email to Chow-Choong Ngeow (cngeow@astro.ncu.edu.tw) before 01 December,
2015, or until the positions are filled. Please indicate which position the
candidate is applied for. Starting date is negotiable and can be as
earliest as possible. Availability of both (or either one) positions will
depends on the outcome of funding.
