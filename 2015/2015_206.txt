 Dear All,

 For your information. The Nobeyama Radio Observatory found mistakes in =
their sensitivity calculator

extended the deadline of the coming proposal.
Please see below.

 Sincerely,
 Shigehisa Takakuwa, on behalf of the Nobeyama Radio Observatory

--------------------------------------------------------------------------=

The correct version of the NRO time estimator is available
now. Please recalculate the observation time for all *OTF PROPOSALS* =
with not only
FOREST but also other single pixel receivers. More information can be =
found in our call for proposal page.
