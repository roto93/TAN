East Asian ALMA Science Workshop 2015
*************************************************

This is the first announcement of the "East Asian ALMA Science Workshop 2015" to be held from December 8 to 11, 2015 at the I-site Nanba in Osaka.

Scope:
The National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ) and the Osaka Prefecture University are pleased to announce the annual ¡§East Asian ALMA Science Workshop 2015¡¨, to be held on December 8 - 11, at the I-site Nanba in Osaka Prefecture.  This is the annual joint ALMA science workshop that involves all three East Asian ALMA partners (Japan, Taiwan and Korea).

The main aim of this workshop is to continue to promote and stimulate international collaboration among the researchers in the EA partners, by reviewing and sharing the most recent ALMA science results form the first 4 years of ALMA operation. With the new observing modes such as long baselines and high frequencies available for cycle 3, now is a good time to review what has been achieved so far and discuss the future prospects for cycle 4 and beyond.  We plan to hold discussion sessions in order to have opportunities for closer communication among the researchers in related fields.  In addition, we plan to have ample time for discussing ¡§Large Proposals¡¨, which is a new framework that is expected to start from cycle 4.

Date:
December 8 - 11, 2015

Venue:
I-site Nanba (Nanba, Osaka)

Language:
Talks and slides shall be given in English.
