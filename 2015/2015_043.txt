*NCU Astronomy Colloquium*
Speaker: Kevin Walsh (Southwest Research Institute (SwRI))
Topic:Asteroid Dynamics and Geology - Origin of near-Earth Asteroids
Time: Feb. 26, 2pm
Place: S4-1013, NCU

Abstract:
Multiple space missions are headed off to return samples from near-Earth
Asteroids. However, near-Earth Asteroids are a transient population with
their population being constantly re-plenished with bodies from the Main
Asteroid belt. The Main Asteroid belt is a big place with lots of diversity
and all regions and asteroid types can make the trip to become near-Earth
Asteroids.  Therefore, context for a returned sample requires connecting a
specific near-Earth Asteroid with a region in the Main Asteroid Belt or
ideally a specific family of asteroids.  However, the dynamical evolution
of asteroids from the Main Belt to the near-Earth population requires
asteroids to drift due to a radiation effect, which itself depends on the
shape and surface properties of the asteroid. This is complicated by the
ability of small asteroids to reshape due to rotation rate changes brought
about by related, but different, radiation effects. This intersection of
asteroid dynamics and geology is critical for understanding the evolution
of the asteroid belt and the delivery of near-Earth Asteroids over time. I
will discuss a hunt for the source region of a space mission target
asteroid, why that led to the discovery of a new asteroid family and how
the reshaping of km-sized asteroids is the critical physics in
understanding which is the actual parent family.
