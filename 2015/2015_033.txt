Speaker:    Hsi-An Pan (Hokkaido University)
Topic:         What is a Giant Molecular Cloud? Are Observers and Simulators Discussing the Same Star-forming Clouds?
Time:         2/16 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
Observations and simulations have now reached the point where the giant molecular cloud (GMCs) populations can be studied over a whole galaxy. This is immensely helpful for understanding star formation, since the cloud properties set the conditions for new star birth. Yet, are these two groups really comparing the same objects? While simulators work in position-position-position (PPP) space, observers see projected properties along the line of sight, identifying clouds in position-position-velocity (PPV) space. If these methods do not identify the same objects, then the interpretation and comparisons between the data sets may be highly misleading. In this research we generated PPV and PPP data for a high-resolution simulated galaxy and compared the identified cloud properties in both data sets.
