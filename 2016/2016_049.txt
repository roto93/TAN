Dear Colleagues,

        With the ALMA Cycle 4 proposal deadline on April 21 fast approaching, prospective users should get the proposals prepared soon. As in previous ALMA proposal cycles, we will hold a mock ALMA proposal review.

        According to past experiences, proposals fail sometimes due to 1) unclear science questions or goals and/or poorly designed experimenting methods/approaches, but also often due to 2) poor writing or last minute compilation. The purpose of this review is to try improving the quality of ALMA-T proposals for better success rate by enforcing potential users to prepare the proposals early, thus, to at least eliminate the last minute writing and to further sharpen the science ideas.

        This mock review is open to all Taiwanese users including the ones outside of ASIAA. The proposal submission deadline is set to 2016.04.01, before the long holiday weekend. Full proposal, including scientific and technical justification, figures and tables, shall be to submit to "almamock@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw" in pdf format.

        Technical and scientific review comments will be sent back to the PIs through email roughly on 2015.04.11. Face-to-face discussion with the ARC staffs or review panel members could be considered and arranged. PIs can incorporate these comments into proposal revision before the "true" submission.

        Please take advantage of this opportunity and use the long weekend to prepare your proposals!

Cheers,
Wei-Hao
