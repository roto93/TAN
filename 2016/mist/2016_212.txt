Dear OIR astronomers in Taiwan,

Here is the announcement about the Gemini Fast Turnaround program. Taiwan community has an access to this program through Taiwan-Subaru collaboration framework (and, of course, Subaru-Gemini collaboration framework). The next deadline is already approaching.

As you may know, this program is very unique, and I strongly suggest you to carefully read the instruction and understand pros/cons of the program before the application. If you think that this program is not useful for your requirements, wait for a while for the next regular Subaru (and Gemini) call for their proposals.

Regards,
Youichi Ohyama (ASIAA)
