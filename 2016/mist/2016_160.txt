Topic:         Constraints on Neutrino Masses from the Lensing Dispersion of Type Ia Supernovae
Time:         10/18 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
We investigate how accurately the total mass of neutrinos is constrained from the magnitude dispersion of Type Ia supernovae due to the effects of gravitational lensing. For this purpose, we use the propagation equation of light bundles in a realistic inhomogeneous universe and propose a sample selection for supernovae to avoid difficulties associated with small scale effects such as strong lensing or shear effects. With a fitting formula for the non-linear matter power spectrum taking account of the effects of massive neutrino, we find 峉m彖 < 1.1 eV (95% CL) for future optical imaging surveys: WFIRST and LSST. Furthermore, we show that it is possible to realize the current tightest limit 峉m彖 < 0.2 eV from deeper surveys, z > 2.5, if we are able to reduce the magnitude error except for lensing to about half of the present value.
