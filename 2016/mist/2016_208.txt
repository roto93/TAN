1st Announcement of EA ALMA Science Workshop 2016-Taiwan

In the past few cycles of ALMA scientific operations, we see great success
from the EA community in producing remarkable results. We are also excited
by the expansion of the ALMA community into Korea. To maintain the momentum
and to promote regional collaboration, we hold regular science workshops in
the three EA-ALMA countries.

We are pleased to announce the 2016 East-Asian ALMA Science Workshop, to be
held by National Tsing Hua University in Hsinchu, Taiwan, on March 10-12,
2017.  Like the previous EA-ALMA Science Workshops, we invite ALMA users to
present their recent results.  Furthermore, we would like to enhance the
workshop functions on promoting discussion and regional collaborations, by
adjusting the workshop format.  We will split part of the workshop into two
parallel sessions on Galactic and extragalactic studies. We will have
special sessions for prospective projects to call for collaborators, for
archival science, and science that require multi-wavelength observations.
The workshop will be timely to develop proposal ideas and form
collaborations for the upcoming Cycle-5 deadline for PI programs.  On the
other hand, we encourage teams that plan to submit large proposals to hold
meetings in advance, and present their ideas in the EA ALMA Science
Workshop.

More specifically, we warmly welcome the following kinds of presentations:
1. new ALMA science results, based on either PI data or archive data.
2. future/ongoing science studies that may benefit from ALMA's new
capabilities (VLBI, polarization, solar)
3. future/ongoing scicece studies that require synergies with other major
observatories
4. cycle-5 proposal ideas that welcome collaborations
5. proposal ideas from non-radio-experts seeking for collaborations and/or
feedback

More details about the workshop can be found on our website:

Please mark your calendar and prepare your trip to Taiwan.
