Arizona Radio Observatory: Call for Proposals (Spring 2017)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Astronomers in Taiwan,

Observing proposals from members of the University Consortium of ALMA-Taiwan
(UCAT) and ASIAA for the 10-meter Submillimeter Telescope (SMT) located on
Mount Graham, Arizona, and the new ALMA Prototype 12-meter Telescope (12m)
located on Kitt Peak, Arizona, of the Arizona Radio Observatory (ARO) are being
solicited for the period February 15 to June 15, 2017. Graduate student
participation is especially encouraged. The proposal deadline for this 2017
spring semester is set on January 20, 2017 (Friday).

The new 12m antenna supports an ALMA Band-3 (84-116 GHz) dual-polarization SBS
(sideband-separating) receiver. The SMT currently supports a dual-polarization
ALMA Band-6 1-mm (211-275 GHz) receiver with SBS mixers, a dual-polarization
Band-7 (320-370 GHz) receiver, and a Band-9 (602-720 GHz) dual-polarization
receiver with ALMA Band-9 mixers. The SMT control system supports both
dual-polarization ("2 IF mode"), and dual-polarization, dual-sideband
observations ("4 IF mode"), as well as OTF mapping. Proposal candidates should
consult the ARO website for technical specifications:
  https://www.as.arizona.edu/arizona-radio-observatory 

Proposal candidates should download the updated Proposal Summary Sheet here:
  https://www.as.arizona.edu/proposals-0 
Proposal candidates are required to list on the Proposal Summary Sheet their
requested observing blocks (LST ranges), dates (MST=UTC-7hrs) on which they are
NOT available to observe, and dates in which sources in those observing blocks
are within the Sun-avoidance zone (44 degrees at the SMT, 10 degrees at the
12m). Proposal candidates are also encouraged to submit up to THREE pages of
scientific and technical justification (including figures and/or tables) with
their Proposal Summary Sheet.

Operator-assisted remote observing is available. Observers who plan to observe
remotely must supply fixed IP address(es) of the computer(s) that will be used
during observing on their Proposal Summary Sheet. Information about remote
observing can be viewed at: http://aro.as.arizona.edu/remote/remote.htm .

Proposals should be emailed in PDF format to kuan[at]asiaa.sinica.edu.tw by
midnight (23:59 CST) January 20, 2017 (Friday).

Dear Prof. Kuan:

We are organizing a symposium to celebrate Prof. Wing-Huen Ip's 70th
birthday next year. Please help to circulate the following announcement in
the TAN. Thanks a lot.

Best,
Rex


****** First Announcement *******
We are organizing a symposium to honor Prof. Wing-Huen Ip on the occasion
of his 70th birthday and pay tribute to his scientific achievements. The
meeting will address a diverse range of subjects and objects in the Solar
system and beyond. It aims at bringing together senior and junior
scientists and students as well to encourage further collaborations as
demonstrated so well by Prof. Ip throughout his career.

Although the detailed schedule is under development, the scientific program
includes planets, comets, asteroids and other solar system objects, physics
of the heliosphere, exoplanets, astronomy of stars and galaxies, and
astrophysics in general. We solicit presentations on these and related
topics.

There will be a welcome party and a celebratory banquet, the detailed
schedule will be announced soon.

We plan to publish a proceeding of the symposium. Guidelines for submission
will be available in the second announcement.

The regular registration fee of the symposium is NTD 3500 (about USD110),
and the student registration fee is NTD 1500 (about USD 50). The fee
includes the banquet and coffee.

For more information of the symposium, please visit our website:

If you have any question, please do not hesitate to email us:
ipsymposium@astro.ncu.edu.tw

Yours sincerely,
The Organizing Committee

Dear OIR astronomers in Taiwan,

Here is the announcement about the Gemini Fast Turnaround program. Taiwan community has an access to this program through Taiwan-Subaru collaboration framework (and, of course, Subaru-Gemini collaboration framework). The next deadline is already approaching.

As you may know, this program is very unique, and I strongly suggest you to carefully read the instruction and understand pros/cons of the program before the application. If you think that this program is not useful for your requirements, wait for a while for the next regular Subaru (and Gemini) call for their proposals.

Regards,
Youichi Ohyama (ASIAA)

> Dear (Potential) Fast Turnaround Users
> 
> 
> The next FT deadline is at 23:59 Hawaiian Standard Time on December 31. The FT program has been used to conduct pilot studies, complete data sets, and follow up newly-discovered objects, although we welcome proposals for any kind of project with scientific value.
> 
> Both Gemini North and South accept FT proposals. See the FT blog for subscription rates, remaining partner time and other information: http://staff.gemini.edu/ft/
> 
> Please be aware that GMOS-N is off the telescope Feb 6-March 29. This also affects GRACES. More details in the call:http://www.gemini.edu/sciops/observing-gemini/observing-modes/fast-turnaround/call-for-proposals
> 
> ***Please note that specific Fast Turnaround proposal templates are now REQUIRED for FT proposals.*** They can be found here: http://files.gemini.edu/~software/phase1/templates/2016B/
> 
> For full details about the program, including the latest Call for Proposals, see the FT web pages (www.gemini.edu/sciops/observing-gemini/observing-modes/fast-turnaround).
