Dear colleague,

Starting on February 8, an on-line course about the physics of
hyperfine interactions and the concepts of experimental methods based
upon those will be organized at Ghent University, Belgium. As a kind
of social experiment, this course will be open for on-line
participation by anybody with an interest in the topic.

If you know people who might be interested to attend "hyperfinecourse"
on-line, kindly forward them this message.

"hyperfinecourse" is taught at a level that is accessible to students
with a bachelor in physics, chemistry or engineering. The language is
English.

The course was meant originally for students at Ghent University,
Belgium. Since two years, the content is offered through a set of
weekly videos (screencasts), which the students watch on-line prior to
coming to class. As a side-effect, the content becomes accessible to
people not studying in Ghent as well.

If you take this course, it means you should spend 40 to 90 minutes
each week to watch the videos, and another 1 to 2 hours to make the
tasks that come with the videos. A report on the tasks has to be
submitted every week, one day before the weekly class session. During
the class session, problems that arose while making the tasks will be
discussed. These class sessions happen in Ghent, but live-stream
access will be provided for remote students (screen + audio). As a new
feature for this year, all students will have the possibility to
discus asynchronously with each other within the slides that are used
in the videos.

The weekly class sessions are on Wednesdays, at 9h00 UTC. This is
convenient for Europe, Africa and Asia, less so for North- and
South-America. If there would be considerable interest from the latter
continents, we will examine whether it is feasible to store the live
session recording for 24 hours. In any case, you get 80% of the
experience even without attending the live sessions.

Background information on this project can be found in this video
(https://youtu.be/Zbrip6ioC_Y), recorded at the HFI-NQI conference in
Canberra (2014).

The course will start on February 8, and will run during 12 weeks
until May 13 (with a two-week break from March 28 until April 8).

A few weeks after the end of "hyperfinecourse", there will be the
HYPERFINE 2016 conference in Leuven (Belgium)
(http://www.hyperfine2016.be). For participants of the course who will
be at the conference, a meeting will be organized just before or
during the conference. This will be an opportunity to meet your class
mates in real life, and to discuss any remaining hyperfine questions.

If you are interested to join, either as a participant or as an
observer, or if you want to keep being informed later, fill out your
information here: http://goo.gl/forms/Nx075YUj49 .

This one-time message is sent to the mailing list used for the
conference series on hyperfine interactions and their applications. No
further emails on this course will be sent to this list. If you want
to receive further information on hyperfinecourse, please fill out the
form mentioned above.


Kind regards,
Stefaan Cottenier (co-chair of HYPERFINE 2016)

Topic:          Col-OSSOS: Colours of the Outer Solar System Origins Survey
Time:           2/1 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
The small icy bodies beyond Neptune in the Kuiper belt originated in the construction zones that formed our planets. These bodies inform our knowledge about the growth of planetary embryos and the evolution of our Solar System. We have an understanding of the surface properties for the largest Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) which retain their primordial inventory of volatile ices. Yet for the smaller typical > 22 mag KBO where we have previously had to rely on what colors and light curves reveal by proxy, this picture remains incomplete. Most KBO physical property studies examine the hodgepodge set of KBOs discovered by surveys with different and varying detection biases that make it challenging to test giant planet migration hypotheses and formation theories for the Solar Systemâ€™s planetesimal disk.


The Outer Solar System Origins Survey (OSSOS) is an on-going large program on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) which for the first time provides a large enough sample of KBOs (~500) to study in a survey where all the detection biases are well characterized. Colours of the Outer Solar System Origins Survey (Col-OSSOS), is a companion 3-year (386-hour) guaranteed time Large Program on 8-m Gemini North telescope to measure a single epoch of g,r,and J band for a sample of OSSOS discovered KBOs with m_râ€™ <= 23.5 mag. Col-OSSOS will create an unprecedented dataset combining surface color information, orbital dynamics, and population statistics to probe the origin and history of the Kuiper belt. Started in August 2014, the first full year and a half of data collection for Col-OSSOS is complete and the analysis work is in progress. I will present a brief overview of Col-OSSOS and an update of where the project is today.


*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________
Speaker:        Howard Yee (University of Toronto)
Topic:          The Evolution of Galaxy Cluster Shape and Brightest Cluster Galaxies since z~1.8
Time:           2/3 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
I will examine two aspects of the growth of galaxy clusters
from z~1.8 to the present time: the evolution of the shape
of galaxy clusters and the growth of the brightest cluster
galaxies (BGCs). Using two large samples of galaxy clusters
from the Second Red-sequence Cluster Survey (RCS2) and the
Spitzer Adaptation of RCS (SpARCS) survey, we measure the
ellipticities of galaxy clusters from z~0.2 to 2.0.  Using
the 418 most massive clusters in the samples, we find the
average ellipticity of the projected spatial distributions
of galaxies in the clusters increases with redshift. This evolution
in cluster shape is consistent with that measured from N-body
simulations. I will also present recent results on the evolution
of the star-formation rate and the growth of the stellar
mass of BCGs using clusters from the SpARCS survey. I will
briefly discuss possible connections between the BCG and the
cluster shape.

                CFHT¡¦s triennial Users¡¦ Meeting will be held in Nice, France, May 1-4. These are always excellent opportunities for our community to come together, discuss accomplishments and plan for the future. Through this message I invite you all (and your colleagues) as our Associate Partners to attend if you¡¦re able/interested. Details of the conference can be found at our website ¡V

http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/en/news/UM2016/

                Don¡¦t hesitate to ask if you have questions. We are working on the program now, which will nominally cover everything from Large Program results, to new instrumentation, to the future of Maunakea astronomy.


                                Mahalo, D.
