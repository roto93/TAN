*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________
Speaker:        Hsi-An Pan (ASIAA)
Topic:          Environmental Dependence of GMCs: simulation and observation
Time:           8/3 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
A long-standing question about star formation is whether it is sensitive to large-scale galaxy structures. Observations show that strong bars (high ellipticity and long length) typically contain less or no star formation, while weak bars (low ellipticity and short) have more. This suggests that large-scale structure can indeed influence star formation. Yet galactic bar is a poorly-explored region, its actual effect on star formation is not yet clear.

If star formation does care about galaxy structures, this should be reflected in the properties of giant molecular clouds (GMCs), because their conditions determine whether a star can form. In this research,  we study the impact of bar on the properties of simulated GMCs formed in a set of galaxies for which their bar strength differs in a quantitatively controlled way.
We also discuss the possibility to observe the environmental dependence of GMCs by considering the observational bias.

Dear Yi-Jehng,

Would you advertise this bi-annual meeting in Numerical Astrophysics over the TAN network?

Thanks.

Best,

Ron

     The Seventh East-Asian Numerical Astrophysics Meeting (EANAM7)
     October  24-28, 2016, Beijing
     http://eanam7.csp.escience.cn/

     First ANNOUNCEMENT
     (Abstract submission until September 16)
---------------------------------------------------------------
*** Abstract submission is now open at  http://eanam7.csp.escience.cn/ ***

------------------------
Aims and Scope
————————————

Numerical simulations have been playing an increasingly vital role in most areas of Astrophysics. The numerical Astrophysical community in the East Asia region is growing and expanding rapidly. The goal of the series of the East-Asian Numerical Astrophysics Meetings (EANAMs) is to bring together numerical Astronomers from the region (but not limited to) to exchange results and promote potential collaborations. The scope of the seventh EANAM will comprise all major astronomical research fields that involve numerical simulations, including (but not limited to) cosmology, astronomical hydrodynamics, magnetohydrodynamics, radiative transfer, particle acceleration, and planetary/stellar/galactic dynamics. In addition, there will also be a focus on computer science applications directed toward astrophysics including numerical methods, simulation data analysis, and high performance computing. Participants from outside of the East Asia are also welcome.
