Dear All,

Sorry to inform you that Academician Fred Lo past away at about 6:00 pm Dec. 16 (US time) in Charlottesville, US at his 70.  As you know, Dr. Lo fight against the cancer for couple years, and the situation became difficult in this week..

We all lost our great mentor, close friend and family.

Sincerely,
Winny

Dear all

the program of the ALMA Band 1 Science workshop that will be held at
ASIAA in Taipei during 16--18 January 2017 is already online:

https://events.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/workshop/20170116/program.php

We want to remind you that *** registration is still open until January
1st 2017***. If you are interested in attending the workshop, especially
if you are in Taiwan, please register before the deadline.

We will dedicate Thursday 19th and Friday 20th January to the discussion
of the Band 1 Science Verification. If you plan on attending and have
not yet told us, please get in touch with Oscar Morata
(omorata@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw). The SV meeting will be held in ASIAA
R1107, which has a relatively low limited seating space and we would
like to know how many extra people are intending to to come.

Finally, we are studying the possibility of providing remote access to
the SV meeting, we will provide more details if we find an appropriate
way of doing it.

Best regards,
    Oscar Morata
    ALMA Band 1 Project Scientist
    on behalf of the SOC

____________________________________________________
Speaker:        Hiroyuki Hirashita (ASIAA)
Topic:          SED fitting to galaxies using Cigale
Time:           12/19 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
While I stayed in Marseille in November, I learned how to use an spectral (SED) fitting code, Cigale. I will briefly talk about it and introduce our plan of an application to Lyman break galaxies at high redshift.


*** Special Seminar ***
____________________________________________________
Speaker:        Hsin-Yu Chen (University of Chicago)
Topic:          Cosmology and Astrophysics with Gravitational-Wave Observations
Time:           12/20 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
The first detections of gravitational waves by LIGO-Virgo initiated the era of Gravitation-Wave Astronomy. Gravitational-waves serve as a new and independent probe of the Universe. In addition, the combination of gravitational-waves with information from other messengers, such as electromagnetic emission from the same source, will lead to a more complete and accurate understanding of cosmology and astrophysics. In this talk, I will discuss what we learned from the LIGO-Virgo first observing run, and what scientific goals we expect to reach in the next few years.


*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________
Speaker:        Siyi Xu (ESO)
Topic:          Planetary Systems around White Dwarfs
Time:           12/21 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Recent studies have shown that extrasolar planetary systems are prevalent around main-sequence stars in the Milky Way. However, little is known about their fate towards the end of the stellar evolution. In this talk, I will show various evidence that some white dwarfs are dynamically active and planetary systems could be prevalent around white dwarfs. I will also talk about the recent discovery of an actively disintegrating asteroid around a white dwarf and how this system fits into our overall understanding of the fate of planetary systems.


*** Tech Lunch Talk [Chinese] ***
