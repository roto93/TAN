Topic:          Col-OSSOS: Colours of the Outer Solar System Origins Survey
Time:           2/1 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
The small icy bodies beyond Neptune in the Kuiper belt originated in the construction zones that formed our planets. These bodies inform our knowledge about the growth of planetary embryos and the evolution of our Solar System. We have an understanding of the surface properties for the largest Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) which retain their primordial inventory of volatile ices. Yet for the smaller typical > 22 mag KBO where we have previously had to rely on what colors and light curves reveal by proxy, this picture remains incomplete. Most KBO physical property studies examine the hodgepodge set of KBOs discovered by surveys with different and varying detection biases that make it challenging to test giant planet migration hypotheses and formation theories for the Solar Systemâ€™s planetesimal disk.


The Outer Solar System Origins Survey (OSSOS) is an on-going large program on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) which for the first time provides a large enough sample of KBOs (~500) to study in a survey where all the detection biases are well characterized. Colours of the Outer Solar System Origins Survey (Col-OSSOS), is a companion 3-year (386-hour) guaranteed time Large Program on 8-m Gemini North telescope to measure a single epoch of g,r,and J band for a sample of OSSOS discovered KBOs with m_râ€™ <= 23.5 mag. Col-OSSOS will create an unprecedented dataset combining surface color information, orbital dynamics, and population statistics to probe the origin and history of the Kuiper belt. Started in August 2014, the first full year and a half of data collection for Col-OSSOS is complete and the analysis work is in progress. I will present a brief overview of Col-OSSOS and an update of where the project is today.

Topic:          The Evolution of Galaxy Cluster Shape and Brightest Cluster Galaxies since z~1.8
Time:           2/3 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
I will examine two aspects of the growth of galaxy clusters
from z~1.8 to the present time: the evolution of the shape
of galaxy clusters and the growth of the brightest cluster
galaxies (BGCs). Using two large samples of galaxy clusters
from the Second Red-sequence Cluster Survey (RCS2) and the
Spitzer Adaptation of RCS (SpARCS) survey, we measure the
ellipticities of galaxy clusters from z~0.2 to 2.0.  Using
the 418 most massive clusters in the samples, we find the
average ellipticity of the projected spatial distributions
of galaxies in the clusters increases with redshift. This evolution
in cluster shape is consistent with that measured from N-body
simulations. I will also present recent results on the evolution
of the star-formation rate and the growth of the stellar
mass of BCGs using clusters from the SpARCS survey. I will
briefly discuss possible connections between the BCG and the
cluster shape.
