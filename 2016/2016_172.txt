SPICA-Taiwan 2 Kick-off meeting

Taiwan has once again, through ASIAA, been invited by the SPICA consortium
to join the project. We are joining through both Europe (SAFARI consortium,
led by SRON) and Japan (SMI consortium). The SPICA project is approved to
go ahead to phase A on the Japanese side, and currently under review with
ESA. The hope is that ESA will also allow SPICA to go ahead to phase A, and
this should become clear in the beginning of 2017. ESA approval is
essential, as it comes with 550 M EUR of funding.

Now that Taiwan is back in the consortium, it is time to start thinking
again what kind of science we are interested in, given the revised design
of the telescope and the instrument suite in comparison to 3 years ago.
There will be a half day meeting to discuss the project at ASIAA, but if
interest is large, it may be extended to a full day meeting. Please
indicate your availability to come to meet at ASIAA at this doodle poll:

There is a mailing list related to this project. Please email Ciska Kemper
at ciska@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw if you want to be included in this mailing
list.

Finally, if you have any scientific ideas of what you would like to do with
SPICA, feel free to email Ciska Kemper as well, to schedule a talk at the
meeting.
