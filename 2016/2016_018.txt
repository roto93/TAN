Dear colleague,

Starting on February 8, an on-line course about the physics of
hyperfine interactions and the concepts of experimental methods based
upon those will be organized at Ghent University, Belgium. As a kind
of social experiment, this course will be open for on-line
participation by anybody with an interest in the topic.

If you know people who might be interested to attend "hyperfinecourse"
on-line, kindly forward them this message.

"hyperfinecourse" is taught at a level that is accessible to students
with a bachelor in physics, chemistry or engineering. The language is
English.

The course was meant originally for students at Ghent University,
Belgium. Since two years, the content is offered through a set of
weekly videos (screencasts), which the students watch on-line prior to
coming to class. As a side-effect, the content becomes accessible to
people not studying in Ghent as well.

If you take this course, it means you should spend 40 to 90 minutes
each week to watch the videos, and another 1 to 2 hours to make the
tasks that come with the videos. A report on the tasks has to be
submitted every week, one day before the weekly class session. During
the class session, problems that arose while making the tasks will be
discussed. These class sessions happen in Ghent, but live-stream
access will be provided for remote students (screen + audio). As a new
feature for this year, all students will have the possibility to
discus asynchronously with each other within the slides that are used
in the videos.

The weekly class sessions are on Wednesdays, at 9h00 UTC. This is
convenient for Europe, Africa and Asia, less so for North- and
South-America. If there would be considerable interest from the latter
continents, we will examine whether it is feasible to store the live
session recording for 24 hours. In any case, you get 80% of the
experience even without attending the live sessions.

Background information on this project can be found in this video
(https://youtu.be/Zbrip6ioC_Y), recorded at the HFI-NQI conference in
Canberra (2014).

The course will start on February 8, and will run during 12 weeks
until May 13 (with a two-week break from March 28 until April 8).

A few weeks after the end of "hyperfinecourse", there will be the
HYPERFINE 2016 conference in Leuven (Belgium)
(http://www.hyperfine2016.be). For participants of the course who will
be at the conference, a meeting will be organized just before or
during the conference. This will be an opportunity to meet your class
mates in real life, and to discuss any remaining hyperfine questions.

If you are interested to join, either as a participant or as an
observer, or if you want to keep being informed later, fill out your
information here: http://goo.gl/forms/Nx075YUj49 .

This one-time message is sent to the mailing list used for the
conference series on hyperfine interactions and their applications. No
further emails on this course will be sent to this list. If you want
to receive further information on hyperfinecourse, please fill out the
form mentioned above.


Kind regards,
Stefaan Cottenier (co-chair of HYPERFINE 2016)
