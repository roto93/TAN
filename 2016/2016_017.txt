> Subject: A new Higgs particle? (fwd)

Maybe we should add a few crucial points, which we knew (understood) but
we didn't elucide further.

No.1: Our Standard Model predicts (or, postdicts) m_{SM Higgs}=v/2 with v
the SM Higgs VEV. You may check with the Particle Data Group to confirm
that this is true.

     The underlying reason is that our "ignition" term is in the purely
family channel, \Phi(3,1), to make sure that the mass generation covers
everything, if needed.

No.2: The origin of mass.

All the masses, including the Higgs sector, the six quark masses (the
quark world), and the lepton masses (the lepton world), are through the
dimensionless couplings. It means that they are probably determined by the
(quantum) 4-dimensional Minkowski space-time, as a whole, not by the
details of the fields.

There is only one "ignition" dimensional term, which is for the turn-on of
the spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB). This process is similar to the
phase transition of some sort, a "super phase transition".

No.3: The origin of fields (point-like particles):

The Einstein basic relation, E^2=(\vec p)^2 + m^2, is meant to describe
the motions. But the squares bother us. So, we turn to the Dirac's
learization, E={\vec \alpha}\cdot {\vec p} + \beta m, for a unique help.
We do this in the lepton world, again for the quark world. The
4-component solution of Dirac equation means that the 2-spin is there and
that the antiparticle is there - the origin of spin is tied to the
(quantum) 4-dimensional Minkowski space-time, so is the origin of
antiparticle.

These, plus the Higgs and the gauge bosons, makes "our world" - complete
and consistent. We don't need anything else.

No.4: That is why we summarize "our world".

We believe that we live in the quantum 4-dimensional Minkowski space-time
with the gauge-group structure SU_c(3) x SU_L(2) x U(1) x SU_f(3) built-in
from the very beginning - the "background" of our world. From the
"background", we see the quark world, with the (123) symmetry, and we
also see the lepton world, with another (123) symmetry.

From the overall consistency, we see that neutrinos as Majorana particles
do not belong. The presence of the 3^\circ K cosmic microwave bakground
(CMB) means that the gauge-group structure should be built-in in the very
beginning. Because of the group structure, we rule out, mathematically,
the neutrinos as majorana particles.

Dear Kingmen and others:

     Thank you so much for keeping us informed.

     In fact, all of us, particle physicists and alike, should think about
these things (problems) in terms of the Standard Model.

     Let's start from quantum fields (particles). The only missing link is
about \lambda (\phi^\dagger \phi)^2, the only renormalizable left-over for
the complex scalar field \phi, in the 4-dimensional Minkowski space-time.
This lambda (=1/8?) is dimensionless in the 4-dimensional Minkowski
space-time and lambda should be determined by the governing space-time in
view of its dimensionlessness. Since lambda = +1/8, it is self-repulsive -
thus it cannot exist by itself.

     The Higgs fields exist in pairs: phi(1,2) (Standard-Model Higgs),
phi(3,2) (mixed family Higgs), and phi(3,1) (purely family Higgs), the
first label SU_f(3) while the second the electroweak SU_L(2). They are
maximally attractive in pair - just enough to overcome the
self-repulsiveness. These fields are just enough to make the eight family
gauge bosons massive as well as to make four family Higgs bosons.

      The quark world has the (123) symmetry (SU_c(3) x SU_L(2) x U(1)).
The lepton world also has the other (weaker) (123) symmetry (SU_L(2) x
U(1) x SU_f(3)). They are free of Landau ghosts, and asymptotically free.
Thus, well-behaved in the r => 0 limit.

      In fact, in this 21st century, we can declare that we live in the
quantum 4-dimensional Minkowski space-time with the gauge-group structure
SU_c(3) x SU_L(2) x U(1) x SU_f(3) built-in from the very beginning. Why
built-in from the very beginning? We could ask the 3^\circ K cosmic
microwave background (CMB) for the answer.

                         Best wishes to you all, Pauchy

Hi Prof. Kuan,

Could you please post the following to TAN, regarding updates from CFHT?

thanks,
yen-ting

------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear CFHT users

1) The deadline for the submission of CFHT Large Programs has been
extended to February 29 2016.

2) New information has been added to the CFHT MegaCam and WIRCam
webpages. Please see:

http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/Instruments/Imaging/Megacam/specsinformation.html
for an update on the new broad band filters and their calibration
against the SNLS deep field catalogs. The page will eventually include
specific calibration info on the narrow band filters as soon as
the observations become available in those bands.

http://cfht.hawaii.edu/Instruments/Imaging/WIRCam/dietWIRCam.html for
the revised photometric calibration of WIRCam and
http://cfht.hawaii.edu/Instruments/Imaging/WIRCam/IiwiVersion2Doc.html
for information on the new non-linearity correction.
