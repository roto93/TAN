Topic:          Gas flows in star-forming galaxies in 3D
Time:           10/3 (Monday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Gas flows are one of the fundamental yet poorly understood processes driving galaxy evolution. This talk focuses on exploring gas flows in local galaxies by studying metallicity gradients and galactic-scale outflows in normal star-forming galaxies. This is made possible by new integral field spectroscopy data that provide simultaneously spatial and spectral information of galaxies. With the new 3D data, I study metallicity gradients and galactic winds to understand inflows and outflows in star-forming galaxies. I show that metallicity gradients in isolated disk galaxies are remarkably simple and universal. Simple chemical evolution models reveal that these simple metallicity gradients are a direct result of the coevolution of gas and stellar disk while galactic disks build up their masses from inside-out. Tight constraints on their mass outflow rates and inflow rates can be placed. I also investigate galactic winds in normal star-forming galaxies using data from the SAMI Gal!
 axy Survey. I show that galactic winds are found to be very common even in normal star-forming galaxies that were not expected to host winds. By comparing galaxies with and without hosting winds, I show that galaxies with high star formation rate surface densities and bursty star formation histories are more likely to develop large-scale galactic winds.

Topic:          Ultraluminous Supersoft X-ray sources as super-critical accretion onto stellar black holes
Time:           10/4 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
While ultraluminous supersoft X-ray sources (ULSs) bear features for intermediate mass black holes or very massive white dwarfs possibly close to Chandrasekhar mass limit, our recent discovery of processing relativistic baryonic jets from a prototype ULS in M81 demonstrate that they are not IMBHs or WDs, but black holes accreting at super-Eddington rates. This discovery strengthens the recent ideas that ULXs are stellar black holes with supercritical accretion,as demonstrated in the case of M101 ULX-1, and provides a vivid manifestation of what happens when a black hole devours too much, that is, it will generate thick disk winds and fire out sub-relativistic baryonic jets along the funnel as predicted by recent numerical  simulations.

Speaker:        Eva Villaver (Autonomous University of Madrid)
Topic:          Single rotating stars and their AGB winds
Time:           10/5 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Heavy modulated mass-loss takes place during the Asymptotic Giant Branch evolution of low-and intermediate-mass stars.  In the process several processes play their role: metallicity, stellar mass, rotation, magnetic fields, the presence of companions and a possible interaction with the ISM.  I will describe how our new stellar evolution models with rotation can  rule out single main sequence stars to achieve the needed physical conditions to cause asymmetrical mass-loss. We have quantified under which circumstances the presence of companions can induce sufficient tidal spin-up to form bipolar Planetary Nebulae. Finally, by computing models of star-planet interactions we have explored the role that substellar companions have in the overall stellar evolution and thus how they might influence PNe properties.
