*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________
Speaker:        Jean Coupon (University of Geneva)
Topic:          Probing the relationship between Galaxies and Dark Matter with Lensing and Clustering in CFHTLenS/VIPERS
Time:           1/20 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
I will present recent results on the connection between galaxies and dark matter haloes up to z=1, measured from a combined lensing and clustering analysis in the CFHTLS/VIPERS field. We obtained 30 deg2 of deep NIR data over the entire VIPERS area: whereas this program was initially designed to get robust stellar masses for the spectroscopic targets, we have shown that when properly calibrating photo-z's with spectro-z's and accounting for photo-z error in the modelling, one is able to get accurate constraints from projected clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing from a photometric sample. This significant increase in survey area for such depths and good lensing data allowed us to consistently probe the Mstar-Mh relation from the peak of the stellar-to-halo mass ratio (SHMR) up to the most massive clusters, a key asset to bring new insights on galaxy evolution.
