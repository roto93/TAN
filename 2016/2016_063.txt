Title: Diffuse Lyman-alpha halos around star forming galaxies ~ as a tracer
of galaxy evolution

Abstract:

Theoretical studies have suggested that Lyman-alpha emission of high-z
star-forming galaxies extends than their UV continuum emission which
reflects star-forming regions in galaxies (e.g., Laursen &
Sommer-Larsen 2007, Zheng et al. 2011, Dijkstra & Kramer 2012,
Verhamme et al. 2012). This extended Lyman-alpha emission feature
around galaxies is so called Lyman-alpha halos (LAHs). Because LAHs
are too diffuse to detect from a single galaxy, the stacking analysis
is often used to find the evidence of LAHs from observational data
(e.g., Steidel et al. 2011, Matsuda et al. 2012). However, there is a
argument that artifacts by the analysis are possible to produce
artificial LAHs. Thus, the existence of LAHs is still under debate. In
order to investigate the presence of LAHs, we use large star-forming
galaxy samples at z = 2-7 found by Subaru telescope, and also
carefully examine potential artifacts mimicking LAHs. In this talk, we
show our analysis and results of LAHs over wide redshift range.
Additionally, we also discuss the dependences between physical
properties of LAEs and the sizes of LAHs based on my recent paper
(Momose et al. 2016).
