Title: The Neptune Trojans and the Vertical Moving
        Trans-Neptunian Objects

Abstract:
Many primitive bodies exist in the vast regions of the solar system beyond
Jupiter, of which the largest population is the trans-Neptunian objects
(TNOs). The details of the orbital distribution of the TNOs preserve
information about the evolution of the solar system.

In this talk, I will introduce our two recent works, which are related
to TNO studies: 1. The Neptune Trojans: dynamically very hot or not that hot?
and 2. The vertical moving TNOs: is there a perpendicular Kuiper Belt?

Currently 17 Neptune Trojans (NTs), the asteroids in co-orbital 1:1 mean
motion resonance with Neptune, have been found. The very high and wide
orbital inclination distribution of NTs implies an unusual formation
mechanism of NTs; the NT have to be captured from a pre-excited planetesimal
disk. Recently, we used Pan-STARRS 1 (PS1) survey data to study the
orbital distribution of NTs and found that the inclination distribution
is rather low compare with the results of previous studies. The new result
may suggest that NTs can be captured from a planetesimal disk without
pre-excited.

In the PS1 survey data, we also identified an unusual TNOs, 2011 KT13
(nicknamed Niku). This object has an 110 degree orbital inclination; it
has a retrograde and almost vertical moving orbit. Together with other
five high-inclination TNOs, the six vertical moving objects appear to
occupy a common orbital plane. We found that this alignment is statistical
significant; the probability occurring by chance is only 0.016%. Our simple
simulations including the hypothetical Planet Nine fail to maintain the
common orbital plane, therefore, an unknown mechanism is required to
explain the observed clustering.
