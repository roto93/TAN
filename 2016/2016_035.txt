Dear Taiwanese community members,

    CFHT is now accepting proposals for the 2016B semester. The
deadline is March 16 2016 23:59 UTC. Consult this URL for more
information:

http://cfht.hawaii.edu/en/science/Proposals/

Please note that if you are interested in using the old MegaCam
filters, you need to make a strong scientific case for this in the
proposal.

Also, we encourage our users to submit bright time proposals for the
16B semester since we had an undersubscription of bright time programs
for the 2016A semester.

As usual, we encourage people to submit snapshot programs.

You will find more details on these items on the above mentioned website.

Good luck to all the proposers.

Daniel Devost for the CFHT team.

*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________
Speaker:        Hauyu Baobab Liu (ESO)
Topic:          Gravitational unstable disks around FU Orionis objects?
Time:           2/24 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Young stellar objects (YSOs) may not accumulate their mass steadily, as was previously thought, but in a series of violent events manifesting themselves as sharp brightening events. These events can be caused by fragmentation due to gravitational instabilities in massive gaseous disks surrounding young stars, followed by migration of these dense gaseous clumps onto the star.  We report our high angular resolution, coronagraphic near-infrared polarization imaging observations using the High Contrast Instrument for the Subaru Next Generation Adaptive Optics  (HiCIAO) of the Subaru 8.2 m Telescope, towards four YSOs which are undergoing luminous accretion outbursts. The obtained infrared images have verified the presence of several hundred AUs scale arms and arcs surrounding these YSOs. In addition, our hydrodynamics simulations and radiative transfer models further demonstrate that these observed structures are indeed explained by strong gravitational instabilities occurring a!
 t the beginning of the disk formation phase. The apparently much smoother and older planet-forming disks may be merely the final products of these tempestuous and stochastic processes.

Dear potential ALMA users,

ALMA will issue its Cycle 4 Proposal Call on March 22. In response to that, Taiwan ARC node will hold two days ALMA User Workshop jointly with tuCASA on March 19 and 26 (Saturday).  Below is the announcement:

        ALMA Users Workshop 2016
        Time: March 19 and 26, 2016
        Place: Room 1203, Astronomy-Mathematics Building, ASIAA
        URL: http://events.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/workshop/20160319/
        Registration Deadline: March 11, 2016.


        The ALMA Regional Center (Taiwan-ARC) of ASIAA and the UCAT Center for ALMA Science Advancement (tuCASA) of the University Consortium of ALMA-Taiwan (UCAT) are pleased to host jointly a two-day ALMA User Workshop for potential ALMA users in Taiwan on March 19 and 26, 2016. New users are strongly encouraged to attend the lectures on the first day.

The call for proposal for ALMA Cycle 4 will be issued on March 22, 2016. The ALMA User Workshop 2016 is designed for introducing ALMA science and preparing ALMA Cycle 4 proposals. It is intended for graduate students, postdocs, faculty members and people who are interested in observing with ALMA. The deadline for registration is March 11, 2016 (Friday).

The program of the ALMA User Workshop 2016 includes:

        - March 19, 2016
                ALMA science
                Basics of (sub)mm interferometry
                 CASA image simulation

        - March 26, 2016
                ALMA Cycle 4 capability
                ALMA ACA stand alone/polarization/VLBI-ALMA observation
                Suggestions of ALMA proposal preparation
                Observing Tool

As previous cycles, proposal mock review will be offered and will be announced separately.

Please install the latest version of CASA and OT BEFORE the workshop. Feel free to ask ARC members for help if there is any difficulty during the installation.


Best,
Yu-Nung
On behalf of Taiwan ARC node
