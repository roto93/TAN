Two ALMA postdoctoral positions in Taiwan - JRID57596

The UCAT (University Consortium of ALMA-Taiwan) invites applications for 2 postdoctoral positions working on ALMA-related sciences.

Taiwan has joined the ALMA project through collaborations with Japan and North America. To promote ALMA research in Universities, UCAT is formed by seven leading universities in radio astronomy in Taiwan - National Tsing Hua University, National Central University, National Taiwan Normal University, National Taiwan University, National Cheng Kung University, National Sun Yat-sen University, and Tamkang University. Areas of research interests of the UCAT faculty include star formation, astrochemistry, active galaxies, galaxy evolution, solar system, and cosmology. More information can be found at our homepage (http://alma.astr.nthu.edu.tw/).

Scientists with radio interferometry background are preferred; however, all candidates with a PhD in any area of astronomy interested to conduct research using ALMA are encouraged to apply. UCAT postdoctoral fellows are expected to conduct their research at one of the seven UCAT universities. Being in a Taiwanese research institute, UCAT postdoctoral fellows have the privilege to apply for Taiwan�¦s share of observing time for ALMA, SMA, CFHT, JCMT, SMT and the 12m of ARO.

The UCAT postdoc appointments will initially be for two years, with possible extension for additional years. Successful applicants are expected to start no later than August 1, 2017. Please submit (1) a curriculum vitae, (2) a publication list, (3) a brief summary of past research experiences, (4) a future research plan, and (5) have three letters of recommendation sent to Prof. Vivien Chen (hchen@phys.nthu.edu.tw) by January 15, 2017 for full consideration.
