The UCAT (University Consortium of ALMA-Taiwan) announces the 2016
UCAT Fellowship Program, which provides outstanding graduate students
opportunities for research with ALMA (Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array).  UCAT fellows are expected to carry
out science projects within the wide framework of ALMA-related
sciences in collaboration with faculty members on the seven UCAT
campuses, including National Center University, National Tsing Hua
University, National Taiwan Normal University, National Taiwan
University, National Cheng Kung University, National Sun Yat-sen
University, and Tamkang University.  UCAT also encourages applications
from candidates with interest in radio astronomy, including
instrumentation, computation, and theory.

The 2016 Fellowship provides support for up to twelve months (August
2016 to July 2017) for Ph.D. program at a monthly stipend of $34,000,
and for master program at a monthly stipend of $10,000.

The deadline for applications and letters of recommendation is Monday,
July 18, 2016.  Award offers will be made by July 25, 2016, with
fellowships expected to begin in August 2016.

Additional Information regarding the 2016 UCAT Fellowship Program,
including the application procedure, is available at the UCAT website
(http://alma.astr.nthu.edu.tw/).

Speaker:        Hsi-Wei Yen (ASIAA)
Topic:          Stacking Spectra in Protoplanetary Disks
Time:           7/18 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:           R1203


*** Special Seminar ***
____________________________________________________
Speaker:        Chia-Hsun Chuang (AIP Potsdam)
Topic:          Baryon Acoustic Oscillation measurements from the BOSS final data release
Time:           7/19 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Recently, the BOSS collaboration submitted a set of papers (arxiv:1607.03143 ~​
03155) analysing the final data release of the BOSS galaxy sample ​​
within redshift 0.2 < z < 0.75​ (~1.2 million galaxies)​. We obtained two independent 1% distance measurements at ​two ​
redshifts​ (z=0.38 and 0.61)​ which can be used to derive the evolution of our universe and understand better dark energy. I would like to explain the methodologies and the cosmological results.

In the second part of this talk, I would like to present our studies of measuring BAO from void clustering (arxiv:1511.04405,1511.04391,1511.04299). It was not possible to measure BAO from voids because of the low statistical power. ​However, ​we have developed a methodology to extract the information from the large scale structure of void clustering observed from BOSS data. In addition, we investigate and model the redshift distortion effect of void clustering​ (arXiv:1605.05352)​
and found that it would be a challenge to measure growth history ​of our universe ​
from voids.


*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________
Speaker:        Ian Czekala (Harvard/Smithsonian CfA)
Topic:          The Fundamental Properties of Young Stars
Time:           7/20 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Accurate knowledge of the fundamental properties of stars--mass, temperature, and luminosity--are key to our understanding of stellar evolution. In particular, empirical measurements of stellar mass are difficult to make and are generally limited to stars that dynamically interact with a companion (e.g., eclipsing or astrometric binaries), a precious but ultimately small sample. First, I will discuss my development of a recent technique that uses the rotation of the protoplanetary disk--a consequence of the star formation process and still present around many pre-main sequence stars--to measure the stellar mass. To vet the absolute accuracy of this technique, I led the analysis of an ALMA Cycle 1/2 program to observe the few circumbinary disks around double-lined spectroscopic binary stars, enabling an independent confirmation of the total stellar mass. Our comparison with radial-velocity results demonstrates that the disk-based dynamical mass technique can reliably achieve !
 precise measurements of stellar mass on the order of 2-5%, clearing the way for widespread application of this technique to measure the masses of *single* stars.

Second, I will discuss our development of novel statistical techniques for spectroscopic inference. Young stars exhibit rich and variable spectra; although interesting phenomena in their own right, accretion veiling and star spots complicate the retrieval of accurate photospheric properties. Moreover, the uncertain spectral type--effective temperature scale for low mass pre-main sequence stars introduces a systematic error when placing a star on the Hertzsprung Russell diagram. The Gaussian process techniques we have developed to address these problems are also generally applicable to a wide range of spectroscopic problems. Lastly, I will discuss recent progress in measuring the masses of a large sample of single pre-main sequence stars observed with the Submillimeter Array, which will double the number of disk-based dynamical mass estimates of pre-main sequence stars. With ALMA, the disk-based technique holds enormous promise to become the primary means of stellar mass for !
 statistically large samples of pre-main sequence stars, ushering in a new era of high precision in star and planet formation studies.
