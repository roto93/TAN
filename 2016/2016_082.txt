TIARA Summer School on Radio Astronomy
Announcement

The aim of this summer school is to provide a broad overview of radio astronomy. The lectures will cover the principles of radio astronomical observations with both single-dish telescopes and interferometers, scientific studies enabled by radio astronomy, and existing radio instruments in the world. In addition to the lecture format, hands-on sessions of radio data reduction and lab tours will be included. Prior knowledge on radio astronomy is not required to participate in the summer school.

Due to resource constraints, the participants are limited to 50 graduate/undergraduate students and junior researchers from within Taiwan and internationally. Local lodging will be provided for up to 40 students. For both participation and lodging support, priority will be given to graduate students in astronomy or undergraduate students who are conducting astronomical research.
