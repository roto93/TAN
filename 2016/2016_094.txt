Topic:          Star Formation in Nuclear Rings of Barred-Spiral Galaxies
Time:           6/15 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Barred-spiral galaxies contain star-forming nuclear rings at their centers. Star formation rates (SFRs) in the rings vary widely in the range of 0.1-10 M��yr��. Ring star formation appears long lived, lasting over a few Gyrs. Some rings show a well-defined azimuthal age gradient of star clusters along a ring, while others do not. To study what controls star formation in the rings, we use numerical simulations by including a prescription for star formation and feedback effects. In models without spiral arms, SFR in a ring exhibits a strong burst at early time and declines to small values at late time. On the other hand, models with spiral arms outside the bar region show multiple starburst activities at late time caused by arm-induced gas inflows. In all models, young star clusters in rings show an azimuthal age gradient only when the SFR is small. A linear stability analysis shows that rings with no age gradient appear gravitationally unstable, consistent with observatio!
 ns. I will also report our recent efforts on star formation in three-dimensional rings and their impact on hot halo gas.
