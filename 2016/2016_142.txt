Arizona Radio Observatory: Call for Proposals (Fall 2016)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Astronomers in Taiwan,

Observing proposals from members of the University Consortium of ALMA-Taiwan
UCAT) and ASIAA for the 10-meter Submillimeter Telescope (SMT), located on
Mount Graham, Arizona, and the new ALMA Prototype 12-meter Telescope (12m)
located on Kitt Peak, Arizona, of the Arizona Radio Observatory (ARO) are
being solicited for the period October 15, 2016 to February 15, 2017. Graduate
student participation is especially encouraged. The proposal deadline for this
2016 fall semester is set on September 10, 2016 (Saturday).

The SMT currently supports a dual-polarization 1-mm (211-275 GHz) receiver
with ALMA Band 6 sideband-separating (SBS) mixers, a dual-polarization 0.8-mm
(320-370 GHz) receiver, a dual-polarization 0.7 mm (420-500 GHz) SIS receiver
with SBS mixers, a 0.4-mm (602-720 GHz) dual-polarization receiver with ALMA
Band 9 mixers, and a new Band 7 receiver with SBS mixers is also available.
The SMT control system supports both dual-polarization ("2 IF mode"), and
dual-polarization, dual-sideband observations ("4 IF mode"), as well as OTF
mapping. The new 12m supports an ALMA Band-3 dual-polarization SBS receiver
(84-116 GHz).

Remote observing is available. Observers who plan to observe remotely must
supply fixed IP address(es) of the computer(s) that will be used during
observing on their Proposal Summary Sheet. Proposal candidates should consult
the ARO website, https://www.as.arizona.edu/aro/ , for technical
specifications.

Proposal candidates can download the updated Proposal Summary Sheet here:
https://www.as.arizona.edu/aro/proposal_submission_information.htm . Proposal
candidates are required to list on the Proposal Summary Sheet their requested
observing blocks (LST ranges), dates on which they are NOT available to
observe, and dates in which sources in those observing blocks are within the
Sun-avoidance zone (44 degrees at the SMT, 10 degrees at the 12m). Proposal
candidates are also encouraged to submit up to THREE pages of scientific
justification (including figures and/or tables) with their Proposal Summary
Sheet. Electronic submissions will be accepted in PDF format ONLY. Scheduling
of successful proposals will be done according to availability of the
receivers requested. The proposal PDF file should be emailed to
kuan[at]asiaa.sinica.edu.tw by midnight (23:59 CST) September 10, 2016
(Saturday).

Dear Prof Kuan,

The link below for the SMA/ALMA proposal survey is broken.
Could you help to send an update to TAN to tell people using this link
instead:

Speaker:        Po-Sheng Huang (ASIAA)
Topic:          The Shaping of the Multipolar Pre-planetary Nebula CRL 618 by
Multidirectional Bullets
Time:           9/5 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
In order to understand the formation of the multipolar structures of the
pre-planetary nebula CRL 618, we perform 3D simulations using a
multidirectional bullet model. The optical lobes of CRL 618 and fast
molecular outflows at the tips of the lobes have been found to have
similar expansion ages of ˜100 yr. Additional fast molecular outflows
were found near the source along the outflow axes with ages of ˜45 yr,
suggesting a second episode of bullet ejections. Thus, in our
simulations, two episodes of bullet ejections are assumed. The shaping
process is simulated using the ZEUS-3D hydrodynamics code that includes
molecular and atomic cooling. In addition, molecular chemistry is also
included to calculate the CO intensity maps. Our results show the
following: (1) Multiepoch bullets interacting with the toroidal dense
core can produce the collimated multiple lobes as seen in CRL 618. The
total mass of the bullets is ˜0.034 M_⊙ , consistent with the observed
high-velocity (HV) CO emission in fast molecular outflows. (2) The
simulated CO J = 3-2 intensity maps show that the low-velocity cavity
wall and the HV outflows along the lobes are reasonably consistent with
the observations. The position-velocity diagram of the outflows along
the outflow axes shows a linear increase of velocity with distance,
similar to the observations. The ejections of these bullets could be due
to magnetorotational explosions or nova-like explosions around a binary
companion.



*** Colloquium ***

Speaker:        Alan Heays (Leiden Observatory)
Topic:          Laboratory astrochemistry:  UV photodestruction of molecules and its
observable isotope effects
Time:           9/6 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Finding ultraviolet photodestruction rates for the many
atoms and molecules present in space is an interesting subject for
fundamental study in laboratory and theoretical chemical physics.  I
will discuss the photodestruction process and its application to the
molecules observed in interstellar clouds, protoplanetary disks, and
planetary atmospheres.  I will also discuss some detailed studies of
N2 and CO photodissociation and their effect on the isotope-dependent
fractionation of N, C and O atoms between different molecular forms,
as observed in interstellar space and within the Solar system.
