Topic:          The Shaping of the Multipolar Pre-planetary Nebula CRL 618 by
Multidirectional Bullets
Time:           9/5 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
In order to understand the formation of the multipolar structures of the
pre-planetary nebula CRL 618, we perform 3D simulations using a
multidirectional bullet model. The optical lobes of CRL 618 and fast
molecular outflows at the tips of the lobes have been found to have
similar expansion ages of ˜100 yr. Additional fast molecular outflows
were found near the source along the outflow axes with ages of ˜45 yr,
suggesting a second episode of bullet ejections. Thus, in our
simulations, two episodes of bullet ejections are assumed. The shaping
process is simulated using the ZEUS-3D hydrodynamics code that includes
molecular and atomic cooling. In addition, molecular chemistry is also
included to calculate the CO intensity maps. Our results show the
following: (1) Multiepoch bullets interacting with the toroidal dense
core can produce the collimated multiple lobes as seen in CRL 618. The
total mass of the bullets is ˜0.034 M_⊙ , consistent with the observed
high-velocity (HV) CO emission in fast molecular outflows. (2) The
simulated CO J = 3-2 intensity maps show that the low-velocity cavity
wall and the HV outflows along the lobes are reasonably consistent with
the observations. The position-velocity diagram of the outflows along
the outflow axes shows a linear increase of velocity with distance,
similar to the observations. The ejections of these bullets could be due
to magnetorotational explosions or nova-like explosions around a binary
companion.

Topic:          Laboratory astrochemistry:  UV photodestruction of molecules and its
observable isotope effects
Time:           9/6 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Finding ultraviolet photodestruction rates for the many
atoms and molecules present in space is an interesting subject for
fundamental study in laboratory and theoretical chemical physics.  I
will discuss the photodestruction process and its application to the
molecules observed in interstellar clouds, protoplanetary disks, and
planetary atmospheres.  I will also discuss some detailed studies of
N2 and CO photodissociation and their effect on the isotope-dependent
fractionation of N, C and O atoms between different molecular forms,
as observed in interstellar space and within the Solar system.
