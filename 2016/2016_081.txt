Dear Colleagues,

We are pleased to announce that pre-registration and abstract submission are
now OPEN for the "Half a Decade of ALMA: Cosmic Dawns Transformed"
(http://go.nrao.edu/ALMA5years) conference which will be held 20 Â¡V 23
September 2016 at the Renaissance Indian Wells Resort in Indian Wells,
California, USA (near Palm Springs).

The Scientific Organizing Committee invites abstract submissions for
contributed oral and poster presentations that describe ALMA science results
and technical achievements. The program will also feature invited
presentations by leading international experts who will report on the latest
ALMA scientific results in their fields. This conference will include a
broad discussion of the most promising future science and technical advances
that could serve as the focus of ALMA Cycle 5 and beyond, including the ALMA
Development Program.

We encourage you to submit an abstract for a contributed oral or poster
presentation and join us in September in California. This will be a dynamic
conference with 300+ participants that will range widely across the many
fields of astrophysics that are being transformed by ALMA. Substantial
support opportunities for students and early career scientists will be
announced soon.

Please visit the conference website  (http://go.nrao.edu/ALMA5years) for
updates and future announcements, and contact the Local Organizing Committee
at ALMA5yrs@nrao.edu with any questions.

Anthony Remijan, on behalf of the Scientific Organizing Committee
