Dear Prof Kuan,

This is the second announcement of the East-Asian ALMA Science Workshop 2016-Taiwan.

The registration is now opened.  Please register through the workshop website:
   http://events.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/workshop/20170310/index.php
In the registration page, you can also submit an abstract if you plan to give an
oral presentation or a poster presentation.  As we mentioned in the first announcement,
we encourage the following kinds of presentations:
1. new ALMA science results, based on either PI data or archive data.
2. future/ongoing science studies that may benefit from ALMA's new capabilities (VLBI, polarization, solar)
3. future/ongoing science studies that require synergies with other major observatories
4. cycle-5 proposal ideas that welcome collaborations
5. proposal ideas from non-radio-experts seeking for collaborations and/or feedback

Please note that the submission deadline for oral presentation is Jan 15, 2017.  For poster
presentation or for those who do not plan to present, the registration deadline is Feb 15, 2017.

The hotel information is online as well.  We encourage you to make early reservations
