Call for Proposals 2017A (KVN VLBI)


The Korean VLBI Network (KVN, http://kvn.kasi.re.kr/) invites scientific
proposals for VLBI observations during the 2017A season from Astronomers
over the world. Observations of successful proposals will be scheduled
between 15th January 2017 and 15th June 2017. Proposals should be emailed
to kvnprop@kasi.re.kr before the deadline of UT 08:00 (KST17:00) on 1st
November 2016.



=EF=81=AC Korean VLBI Network (KVN)

The Korean VLBI Network (KVN) is a dedicated mm-VLBI network, operated by
Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute (KASI, http://www.kasi.re.kr).
Its three 21m radio telescopes are located in Seoul, Ulsan and Jeju Island
around South Korea. The baseline lengths ranges from 305km to 476 km. Its
4-channel receiving system allows simultaneous observation at 22, 43, 86,
and 129 GHz. For 2017A season, 22, 43, and 86 GHz are available. Risk-share
Observation at 129 GHz is available. Total machine time of 300 hours are
planned for this call. The maximum observation time of a proposal will be
limited to 100 hours. If requested in the proposals, the observation time
can be allocated over a year, until January 15, 2018, for this call. But
the maximum observation time will be NOT increased. Details of the
information and current status of the KVN can be found in the KVN VLBI
Status Report (http://radio.kasi.re.kr/kvn/status_report_2016/array.html).

Proposer should fill the KVN VLBI proposal form (tex file can be found at
http://kvn.kasi.re.kr/index.html/obs_proposal.php). Please carefully follow
the instruction of the proposal form. A separate scientific and technical
justification is mandatory. This Justification should be submitted together
with the proposal form and not exceed 3 pages.
