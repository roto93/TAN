Speaker:        Hui Li (Los Alamos National Laboratory)
Topic:          Asymmetries in Protoplanetary Disks and Implications for
Planet Formation
Time:           5/30 (Monday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
The majority of young low-mass stars are surrounded by disks, consisted of
large reservoirs of gas and dust out of which planetary systems eventually
form. In the recent years, high spatial resolution observations of such disks
have revealed many details that are providing interesting constraints on the
disk physics as well as dust dynamics, both of which are essential for
understanding planet formation. In particular, large-scale features (e.g,
gaps) and asymmetries (e.g., vortices?) are detected, including sources like
HL Tau. In this talk we will give an introduction to the disk instabilities,
in particular the Rossby wave/vortex instability and a new type of “heavy
core” instability related to dust, that might be responsible for explaining
asymmetries.  We will discuss how gas+dust two-fluid modeling can be coupled
with radiative transfer calculations to help interpret the observations and
constrain the parameters in such systems. Implications for future
observations!
  will be explored as well.

Topic:          Numerical Simulations of Black Hole Accretion
Time:           5/30 (Monday) 11:00 - 12:00
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Accreting black holes are observed in a large variety of systems in astronomy:
active galactic nuclei, X-ray binaries, tidal disruption events, gamma-ray
bursts. While analytical one-dimensional models are very useful, some aspects
of accretion physics such as the  formation of jets and winds are beyond the
scope of such models.  Numerical general relativistic MHD simulations are able
to include more  physics than analytical models and are proving increasingly
useful for  studying the multidimensional gas dynamics and radiative
properties of  accretion flows. The talk will review some current progress.
