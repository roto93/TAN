Topic:          Magnesium isotopes as a chemical evolution probe
Time:           6/28 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Over the recent years, the studies of the chemical evolution of the Milky Way have seen a major leap forward, in part due to large-scale spectroscopic surveys of stars, like APOGEE, Gaia-ESO, LAMOST and GALAH to name a few.

While these surveys have provided significant insight into the overall behavior of a large number of elements in different stellar populations, many details are still not understood. For instance, the mechanism behind the multiple population phenomenon in globular clusters, as well as the onset of AGB star contributions to the Milky Way halo chemistry is not yet well explained.

Nucleosynthesis models typically predict not only the bulk abundances of the elements, but also their isotopic composition. While elemental abundances in stars provide a wealth of information, in cases where the isotopic abundances can be measured even more can be learned, as this gives a detailed look into the preceding nucleosynthesis.

In this talk I will present how the measurement of Mg isotopes from high resolution stellar spectra can provide new insights into the Milky Way chemical evolution. Both in the context of globular clusters as well as other stellar populations. While earlier investigations have used standard 1D stellar atmospheric models, we have for the first time applied state-of-the-art 3D hydrodynamical models to this problem. This has resulted in significantly different isotopic distributions, and will help pave the way to answer some of the outstanding questions in our Galaxy's chemical evolution.



*** Colloquium ***

Speaker:        Yoshiki Toba (ASIAA)
Topic:          Dust Obscured Galaxies viewed with Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam
Time:           6/29 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Dust Obscured Galaxies (DOGs) are optically-faint, but infrared (IR)-bright objects at z~2. Their mid-IR (MIR) flux densities are three orders of magnitude larger than those at optical wavelengths, which implies dust heating by significant star formation (SF), an active galactic nucleus (AGN), or both, and the bulk of the optical and ultraviolet (UV) emission from them is absorbed by dust.

Recently, some works have reported that the brighter MIR DOGs are more AGN-dominated, and indicated that black holes in the IR-bright DOGs are expected to show the highest accretion rate during a major merger event. In addition, IR-bright DOGs could tend to reside in richer environments than fainter ones, and the most luminous DOGs may evolve into brightest cluster galaxies. Therefore, particularly IR-bright DOGs are expected to be a crucial population in terms not only of the co-evolution of galaxies and supermassive black holes (SMBHs) but also of structure formation. However, efficient searches for luminous DOGs have been difficult in previous surveys due to their faintness in the optical and low surface densities. Therefore, high-sensitivity and wide-area surveys in both optical and MIR are required to search for the most IR-bright DOGs.

In this talk, I will present our recent studies on IR-bright DOGs based on the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) and Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explore (WISE). In particular, I will focus on their statistical properties such as IR luminosity function, IR luminosity density, and clustering properties (Toba et al. 2015; 2016b in prep.).
