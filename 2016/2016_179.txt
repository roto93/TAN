Topic:          The Constraint on the Mass Accretion Rate of Cygnus A with Submillimeter Array
Time:           11/21 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
How the mass accretion rate of SuperMassive Black Holes (SMBHs) is related to the gas feeding from the larger spatial scales, and how it is related to the energetic jet/outflow activities, are fundamental questions for the understandings of the active galactic nuclei (AGN). Faraday Rotation Measure (RM), the tracer of electron column density and magnetic field strength along the line of sight, is one of the powerful method to constrain the mass accretion rate at the vicinity of SMBH. We present the polarimetric results on the core emissions of Cygnus A utilizing Sub Millimeter Array (SMA) at millimeter wavelengths and derive the constraints on the Faraday rotation measure. There is no statistically significant detection (less than 0.9% as 3 sigma) of the polarized emissions from Cygnus A. Low fractional polarization at 230 GHz is presumably due to variating Faraday RM screen since the high percentage of polarization (12 %) have been detected with mid-Infrared observations. W!
 ith the scenarios of beam depolarizations from the accretion flow, the mass accretion rate and the accretion power can be constrained, and convection-dominated accretion flow solution can be ruled out.



*** Colloquium ***

Speaker:        Elizabeth Tasker (JAXA)
Topic:          From Galaxies to Planets (A medley!)
Time:           11/23 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Star formation occurs in the dense molecular gas clouds within the galaxy's interstellar gas. But while these clouds are relatively small (of order 10s pc) their properties are morphed and shaped by the galactic-scale structure and interactions with neighbouring clouds. The first part of this talk explores how large-scale interactions affect these stellar cradles and the resultant star formation using hydrodynamical simulations.

The second part of the talk turns to look at planet formation. Exoplanet observations have revealed a large population of planets on short orbits close to their host star. Their origin is a debated topic, however a popular theory suggests they migrated inwards after forming in the outer parts of the protoplanetary disc. Such motion would allow planets to undergo heavy accretion of smaller planetesimals. This second part of the talk discusses whether an observational signature of such an event might be detectable.
