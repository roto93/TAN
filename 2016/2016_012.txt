Astronomical Society of the Republic of China 2016 Scientific Assembly
(ASROC2016)

National Cheng Kung University, Tainan

May 13  15, 2016

The 2016 Scientific Assembly of the Astronomical Society of the
Republic of China (ASROC2016) will be held at National Cheng Kung
University on May 13 (Friday)  15 (Sunday), 2016.  This is an annual
event for all astronomers and astrophysicists in Taiwan to present
their most recent discoveries and observations, to report their latest
research results and to exchange ideas, also to organize
collaborations when desirable.  Oral presentations and conference
posters in all areas of astronomy and astrophysics are solicited.
ASROC2016 is also an excellent venue for students, in particular
graduate students, to present their research findings or progress from
their thesis studies.

The meeting will include plenary talks, scientific and educational
sessions, poster presentation, and a business meeting.  The featured
plenary speakers are 1) Prof. Harold A. Weaver, Jr. of Johns Hopkins
University.  Prof. Weaver is the New Horizons project scientist at the
Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, where he joined
the staff in May 2002.  He was also the co-leader of the team that
used the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) to find two new moons in the
Pluto system.  His research interests include comets, planets and
their satellites, and formation and evolution of planetary systems.
His plenary talk will be ¨New Horizons: Mission to Pluto.〃
2) Mr. Zolt G. Levay of Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI).
Mr. Levay is a member of the Hubble Heritage Team and has developed software
for astronomical data display and analysis.  He works with scientists at
the STScI and around the world to process HST images and present them
in a form that is aesthetic and educational to the general public as
well as inspiring and thought-provoking to scientists.  Mr. Levay was
awarded an STScI Individual Achievement Award in 1997.  He will
present ¨The Heritage of Hubble Space Telescope.〃

ASROC2016 website is now open for registration.  Participants of the
scientific assembly should submit their abstracts and register
on-line.  A registration fee of NT$1,000 (NT$800 for students) should
be paid on site.

The Astronomical Society cordially invites you to participate in this
annual event with all the many interesting and exciting activities.
For more details and updated information, please visit the ASROC
website at http://www.asroc.org.tw/.

Attached are the official circular in Chinese and English. [omitted. - YJK]

Dear Kingmen and others:

     Thank you so much for keeping us informed.

     In fact, all of us, particle physicists and alike, should think about
these things (problems) in terms of the Standard Model.

     Let's start from quantum fields (particles). The only missing link is
about \lambda (\phi^\dagger \phi)^2, the only renormalizable left-over for
the complex scalar field \phi, in the 4-dimensional Minkowski space-time.
This lambda (=1/8?) is dimensionless in the 4-dimensional Minkowski
space-time and lambda should be determined by the governing space-time in
view of its dimensionlessness. Since lambda = +1/8, it is self-repulsive -
thus it cannot exist by itself.

     The Higgs fields exist in pairs: phi(1,2) (Standard-Model Higgs),
phi(3,2) (mixed family Higgs), and phi(3,1) (purely family Higgs), the
first label SU_f(3) while the second the electroweak SU_L(2). They are
maximally attractive in pair - just enough to overcome the
self-repulsiveness. These fields are just enough to make the eight family
gauge bosons massive as well as to make four family Higgs bosons.

      The quark world has the (123) symmetry (SU_c(3) x SU_L(2) x U(1)).
The lepton world also has the other (weaker) (123) symmetry (SU_L(2) x
U(1) x SU_f(3)). They are free of Landau ghosts, and asymptotically free.
Thus, well-behaved in the r => 0 limit.

      In fact, in this 21st century, we can declare that we live in the
quantum 4-dimensional Minkowski space-time with the gauge-group structure
SU_c(3) x SU_L(2) x U(1) x SU_f(3) built-in from the very beginning. Why
built-in from the very beginning? We could ask the 3^\circ K cosmic
microwave background (CMB) for the answer.

                         Best wishes to you all, Pauchy

Addendum to our weekly mailing.

There will be an additional special seminar on Thursday by the Observatory Scientist of the Joint ALMA Observatory.

*** Special Seminar ***
____________________________________________________
Speaker:        John Carpenter (Joint ALMA Observatory)
Topic:     The Evolution of Circumstellar Disks: ALMA Observations of the Upper Sco OB Association
Time:           1/21 (Thursday) 14:30 - 15:30     !! Note the non-standard time !!
Place:           R1107         !! Note the non-standard place !!
Abstract:
The supply and lifetime of gas and dust in circumstellar disks are among the primary determinants of the properties of young planetary systems. Most of the information on disk evolution has so far come from infrared surveys, which have established that hot dust in primordial disks dissipates in approximately 5-10 Myr. ALMA is now playing a central role in these studies by probing colder gas and dust in disks. In this talk, I present recent results from an ALMA survey of 106 disks in the Upper Sco OB association. At an age of 5 Myr, Upper Sco is a benchmark region to establish the properties of disks at the end state of their evolution. By comparing Upper Sco with disk properties in young regions, we can assess how the gas and dust in disks evolve on timescales of 5 Myr.
[This is a joint special seminar and planetary science group talk.]

> Time:                 1/20 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20

> Abstract:
> I will present recent results on the connection between galaxies and dark matter haloes up to z=1, measured from a combined lensing and clustering analysis in the CFHTLS/VIPERS field. We obtained 30 deg2 of deep NIR data over the entire VIPERS area: whereas this program was initially designed to get robust stellar masses for the spectroscopic targets, we have shown that when properly calibrating photo-z's with spectro-z's and accounting for photo-z error in the modelling, one is able to get accurate constraints from projected clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing from a photometric sample. This significant increase in survey area for such depths and good lensing data allowed us to consistently probe the Mstar-Mh relation from the peak of the stellar-to-halo mass ratio (SHMR) up to the most massive clusters, a key asset to bring new insights on galaxy evolution.
