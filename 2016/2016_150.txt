*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________
Speaker:        Houjun Mo (UMass)
Topic:          Reconstructing the initial conditions to simulate the formation of the
local universe
Time:           9/27 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
I will describe a method that can be used to reconstruct the initial conditions of the local universe accurately. The method is applied to the SDSS volume. High-resolution simulations of the reconstructed initial conditions have been carried to recover of the formation histories and structures observed in the local universe.  I will also describe how the results can be used to study the formation and structure of the local cosmic web and of galaxies that are embedded in it.
