Title: The Hyper Suprime-Cam Pipeline
The Hyper Suprime-Cam Strategic Survey Program aims to image 1400
square degrees with HSC on Subaru to study galaxy formation and
cosmology using weak lensing.  We currently have collected over 5000
science-grade exposures towards this goal, with more to come over the
next few years.  To reduce this data, we have constructed a pipeline
based on that being developed for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope.
I will introduce the HSC pipeline, outline its features and the
quality of the reduced data, and demonstrate how the pipeline can be
used to reduce open-use HSC data or form the basis for other
astronomical image operations.
