Astronomical Society of the Republic of China 2016 Scientific Assembly
(ASROC2016)

National Cheng Kung University, Tainan

May 13 - 15, 2016

The 2016 Scientific Assembly of the Astronomical Society of the
Republic of China (ASROC2016) will be held at National Cheng Kung
University on May 13 (Friday)  15 (Sunday), 2016.  This is an annual
event for all astronomers and astrophysicists in Taiwan to present
their most recent discoveries and observations, to report their latest
research results and to exchange ideas, also to organize
collaborations when desirable.  Oral presentations and conference
posters in all areas of astronomy and astrophysics are solicited.
ASROC2016 is also an excellent venue for students, in particular
graduate students, to present their research findings or progress from
their thesis studies.

The meeting will include plenary talks, scientific and educational
sessions, poster presentation, and a business meeting. The featured
plenary speakers are 1) Prof. Harold A. Weaver, Jr. of Johns Hopkins
University. 2) Mr. Zoltan G. Levay of Space Telescope Science
Institute (STScI). Prof. Weaver, the New Horizons project scientist,
will give a plenary talk on ¨The Exploration of Pluto and the Kuiper
Belt by New Horizons.〃 Mr. Levay, the Imaging Group Lead of the Office
of Public Outreach and PI of the Hubble Heritage Project at STScI,
will talk about ¨Visualizing Hubble's Colorful Universe.〃

In the Assembly, the Society will also present the 3rd Heaven Quest
Award to Academician Frank Shu for his distinguished contributions to
astronomical research, and the 3rd Heaven Talk Award to Prof.
Han-Tzong Su and the APOD Chinese translation team in National Cheng
Kung University for their outstanding contributions to astronomy
education and popularization of astronomy. In addition to the
scientific agenda, a conference banquet will be held at noon on May 14
(Sat) and all meeting participants are welcome to attend; the
afternoon is reserved for group discussions or group excursions of
choice. Exhibitions of astronomical books and instruments are also
planned during the meeting.

ASROC2016 website is now open for registration and abstract
submission. The deadline for online registration is April 15 and for
abstract submission, March 31. Participants of the Scientific Assembly
should submit their abstracts and register on-line. A registration fee
of NT$1,000 (NT$800 for students) should be paid on site. The LOC has
secured 45 rooms at Zenda Suite; participants who would like to stay
there should fax or email the reservation form to Zenda Suite before
these rooms are released on April 13. For more detailed information

*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________
Speaker:        Hyosun Kim (ASIAA)
Topic:          Circumstellar Spirals/Shells/Arcs: the Messages from Evolved Stars
Time:           3/16 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Evolved stars are the birth places of the chemical elements, and their
extensive mass loss provides an important source of gas and dust to
the interstellar medium. An understanding of the late stellar
evolution and the nature of the mass loss process is important input
for studies of the chemical evolution of a galaxy and the formation of
next generations of stars. The shaping of the outflows is structured
exhibiting arcs, shells, and spirals. Ever since the first discovery
of a circumstellar spiral pattern of a heavily mass-losing evolved
star, a paradigm whereby such patterns are induced by the orbital
motions of the (postulated) central binary stars was emphasized. In
addition, many ring-like patterns observed for longer than a few
decades can be explained by the same spiral-shell pattern, but viewed
at different angles. Recent high-resolution high-sensitivity molecular
line maps from the ALMA and other sub-mm/mm interferometers facilitate
new detections of circumstellar spiral-like patterns, and therefore
the spirals/shells/arcs have led to a resurgence of interests. In this
colloquium, I will describe the impact of binaries on the evolution of
the late stages of stellar evolution. In particular, I suggest that
the coexistence of bipolar (or multipolar) structures and shell-like
patterns can both be understood within the framework of unified model.
