Topic:          The interstellar medium in dwarf galaxies
Time:           12/15 (Thursday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Dwarf galaxies are the most numerous type of galaxy in the local Universe. They tend to have low metallicity and low dust-to-gas ratio compared to spiral galaxies. Understanding the interstellar medium in dwarf galaxies may provide crucial insights on the high-redshift galaxies that have comparable metallicity. In this talk, I will show the recent results from high-resolution numerical simulations of isolated dwarf galaxies, which can start to resolve the cold gas and stellar feedback on galactic scales. In particular, I will focus on the formation of molecular hydrogen and its (non-)correlation with star formation, which has important implications to the sub-grid recipes widely adopted in many large-scale cosmological simulations. I will also discuss the interplay of different types of stellar feedback that shapes the interstellar medium in dwarf galaxies, where the gas is driven far out of thermal- and chemical-equilibrium. Finally, I will demonstrate how the galactic outf!
 lows are controlled by the number of supernovae that occur in low-density environments.
