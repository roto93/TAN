Arizona Radio Observatory: Call for Proposals (Spring 2016)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Astronomers in Taiwan,

Observing proposals from members of the University Consortium of ALMA-Taiwan
(UCAT) and ASIAA for the 10-meter Submillimeter Telescope (SMT), located on
Mount Graham, Arizona, and the new ALMA Prototype 12-meter Telescope (12m)
located on Kitt Peak, Arizona, of the Arizona Radio Observatory (ARO) are
being solicited for the period February 15, 2016 to June 15, 2016. Graduate
student participation is especially encouraged. The proposal deadline for this
2016 spring semester is set on January 27, 2016 (Wednesday).

The SMT currently supports a dual-polarization 1-mm (211-275 GHz) receiver with
ALMA Band 6 sideband-separating (SBS) mixers, a dual-polarization 0.8-mm
(320-370 GHz) receiver, a dual-polarization 0.7 mm (420-500 GHz) SIS receiver
with SBS mixers, a 0.4-mm (602-720 GHz) dual-polarization receiver with ALMA
Band-9 mixers, and a new Band 7 receiver with SBS mixers will be available in
Spring 2016. The SMT control system supports both dual-polarization
("2 IF mode"), and dual-polarization, dual-sideband observations ("4 IF mode"),
as well as OTF mapping. The new 12m supports an ALMA Band-3 dual-polarization
SBS receiver (84-116 GHz).

Remote observing is available. Observers who plan to observe remotely must
supply fixed IP address(es) of the computer(s) that will be used during
observing on their Proposal Summary Sheet. Information about Remote Observing
can be viewed at http://aro.as.arizona.edu/remote/remote.htm . Proposers should
consult the ARO website http://aro.as.arizona.edu/ for technical specifications.
For operational questions and further information about remote observing, please
contact Tom Folkers, Operations Manager at tfolkers@ email.arizona.edu.

Proposal candidates can download the updated Proposal Summary Sheet here:
http://aro.as.arizona.edu/proposal_submission_information.htm . Proposers are
required to list on the Proposal Summary Sheet their requested observing blocks
(LST ranges), dates on which they are NOT available to observe, and dates in
which sources in those observing blocks are within the Sun-avoidance zone (44
degrees at the SMT). Proposal candidates are also encouraged to submit up to two
pages of scientific justification (including figures and/or tables) with their
Proposal Summary Sheet. Electronic submissions will be accepted in PDF format
ONLY. Scheduling of successful proposals will be done according to availability
of the receivers requested. The proposal PDF file should be emailed to
kuan@ asiaa.sinica.edu.tw by midnight (23:59 CST) January 27, 2016 (Wednesday).

Paul Price (Princeton)
Title: The Hyper Suprime-Cam Pipeline
The Hyper Suprime-Cam Strategic Survey Program aims to image 1400
square degrees with HSC on Subaru to study galaxy formation and
cosmology using weak lensing.  We currently have collected over 5000
science-grade exposures towards this goal, with more to come over the
next few years.  To reduce this data, we have constructed a pipeline
based on that being developed for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope.
I will introduce the HSC pipeline, outline its features and the
quality of the reduced data, and demonstrate how the pipeline can be
used to reduce open-use HSC data or form the basis for other
astronomical image operations.

Dear All,

I would like to bring to your attention the ALMA science conference in September this year.
It will be in California, and all topics in astronomy are included.  The registration will open
in mid March.  Please see more details here:

http://www.cvent.com/events/half-a-decade-of-alma-cosmic-dawns-transformed/event-summary-12c52aba230240578621efced142116e.aspx

Those with ALMA science results in the early cycles are highly encouraged to attend this conference.

Cheers,
Wei-Hao
