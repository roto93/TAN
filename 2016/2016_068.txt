Title:
Statistical properties of Dust Obscured Galaxies revealed by HSC-SSP
data with infrared data

Abstract:
Dust Obscured Galaxies (DOGs) are a subset of high-redshift (z~2)
optically-faint ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs). Recently,
some works have reported that the brighter mid-infrared DOGs are more
AGN-dominated, and indicated that black holes in the IR-bright DOGs
are expected to show the highest accretion rate during a major merger
event. In addition, some works reported that IR-bright DOGs tend to
reside in richer environments than fainter ones, and the most luminous
DOGs may evolve into brightest cluster galaxies. Therefore,
particularly IR-bright DOGs are expected to be a crucial population in
terms not only of the co-evolution of galaxies and supermassive black
holes (SMBHs) but also of structure formation.
Combining the early data of the deep and wide optical data from Hyper
Suprime-Cam (HSC) Subaru Strategic Program (SSP), VIKING DR2 near-IR,
and WISE (ALLWISE) mid-IR data, we are searching the IR-bright DOGs.
In this presentation, we will report the statistical properties of
DOGs such as luminosity function, luminosity density, and clustering
properties (Toba et al. 2015, 2016 in prep.).
