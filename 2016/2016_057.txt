First Announcement of The 10th East Asian Meeting on Astronomy (EAMA10)


This is the first announcement of EAMA10, to be held at Seoul National
University, Seoul, Korea, on 2016 September 27-30.

http://astro.snu.ac.kr/eama10


East-Asia Meeting on Astronomy (EAMA) aims at promoting collaborations
between astronomers in the East Asian region. Since its first meeting
in 1990 in China, the EAMA meeting has been indeed providing a place
to discuss the ideas and to coordinate the efforts on fostering
collaborations among East Asian countries as well as among
individuals. The formation of EACOA (East Asian Core Observatories
Association) in 2005 was a meaningful output of EAMA. The upcoming
10th EAMA (EAMA10) will be held on September 27-30, 2016 in Seoul,
Korea. The astronomical activities in the East Asian region are now
quite diverse and more collaborative than ever before, without
mentioning individual projects. EAMA10 will contribute to further
promoting such activities by discussing regional activities, current
and future large facilities, science projects, and astronomy education
and public outreach in East Asian countries. As the 10th meeting, it
will be also a good opportunity to look back the astronomical
achievements of the East Asian region during past 25 years and to
foresee its next 25 years.

The meeting will have the following agenda.

Part 1. Regional Activities
