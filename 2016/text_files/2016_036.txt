*** ASIAA/NTU Joint Colloquium ***

Speaker:        Howard K.C. Yee (Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics, University of Toronto)
Topic:          The Evolution of Galaxies in Clusters at z~1 and Beyond
Time:           3/1 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           Physics 104
Abstract:
Galaxy clusters provide a large range of environments for the study of
how the environment affects galaxy evolution. I will present some recent
results on the evolution of galaxies in clusters at z~1 and beyond from
two large cluster surveys.  SpARCS is an imaging survey designed to search
for galaxy clusters up to z~2 using the cluster red-sequence technique
based on a combination of Spitzer Space Telescope’s IRAC 3.6um and
ground-based z’-band images; GLASS is a multi-object spectroscopic survey
of 10 of the richest SpARCS clusters at z~1 using the Gemini 8.2m
telescopes. Analysis of GCLASS data show that galaxies in-falling into
clusters at z~1 have their star formation suppressed in a relatively short
time scale of less than 0.5 Gyr at an average location close to 0.5 r_200
(the cluster-centric radius within which the cluster is largely virialized).
From imaging data obtain using the 24um MIPS camera on Spitzer, we also
find that lower-mass in-falling galaxies show a possible last-gasp increase
in their star formation before become quiescent. Using far-IR/submm data
from the Herschel Space telescope, we will take a detailed look at the
change in star formation via dust emission in 3 clusters at z~1.2 as
galaxies in-fall into the clusters.
