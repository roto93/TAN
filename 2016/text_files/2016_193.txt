Topic:          Epitaxial growth of NbN nanofilms on a 3C-SiC/Si substrate with high critical temperature
Time:           12/5 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
We have realized epitaxial 4.7 nm- NbN film on a (100)-oriented 3C-SiC/Si substrate by dc reactive magnetron sputtering at high temperature. This is further confirmed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). We present the first report of 1.3 nm shows a superconducting transition temperature of 8.8K, which is the highest reported for NbN films of comparable thickness. For comparison, the NbN films with a thickness between 1.3 and 6 nm were deposited, and the relationship between resistivity and superconducting properties of the differently thick NbN films are discussed. In addition, the aging effects of 2.6 nm-NbN film are also studied.

Topic:          Black hole growth and black hole - galaxy co-evolution
Time:           12/7 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Supermassive black holes (SMBHs), found in the center of galaxies, are thought to play an essential role in the evolution of galaxies. Their growth seems to be closely connected to the star formation history of their host galaxies. However, observationally there are still several fundamental unanswered questions regarding the growth of black holes. How is SMBH growth triggered and fueled? What role does AGN feedback and AGN outflows play for galaxy evolution? How do SMBHs grow over cosmic time scales? What role do SMBH mass and accretion rate play in their evolution? I will present recent results and upcoming projects to address these questions observationally and shed new light on the growth history of SMBHs and the connection to their host galaxies. In particular, I will discuss results on the cosmic evolution of the active black hole mass function, accretion rate function and AGN host galaxy mass function and their implications.
