*IAU Symposium S332 Astrochemistry VII =E2=80=93 Through the Cosmos from Ga=
laxies
to Planets*

*Puerto Varas, Chile 20-24 March 2017*



Dear Colleague,



We have a number of important deadlines now approaching and we would like
to remind you of these.  Please ensure that you take the necessary actions
before they pass.



*Hotel Discount Rates *
                                    *30 November 2016*



We have managed to negotiate an extension to our original deadline date. We
are holding block bookings at a number of hotels at discounted rates but
the final date to guarantee such rates is Wednesday 30 November. (This
overrides the previously announced 11 November deadline.) Note that no
payment is made at this time. The hotel will hold your reservation against
a current credit card.



If you have any problems making a reservation, please inform Maria
Cunningham (maria.cunningham@unsw.edu.au) and Gautier Mathys (
gmathys@eso.org). They will do their best to resolve any problems.

Information on hotels can be found at: https://iaus332.physics.
unsw.edu.au/local-information/accommodation/



Note that only three hotels (Cumbres, Caba=C3=B1a del Lago, and Patag=C3=B3=
nico)
provide booking at the discounted rate via their web reservation form; for
all other hotels, you should send a reservation request to the hotel via
email so as to benefit from the conference rate (see the specific
information for each hotel by following the respective =E2=80=9CMore info=
=E2=80=9D link
from the symposium accommodation web page).
