Addendum to our weekly mailing.

There will be an additional special seminar on Thursday by the Observatory Scientist of the Joint ALMA Observatory.

*** Special Seminar ***
____________________________________________________
Speaker:        John Carpenter (Joint ALMA Observatory)
Topic:     The Evolution of Circumstellar Disks: ALMA Observations of the Upper Sco OB Association
Time:           1/21 (Thursday) 14:30 - 15:30     !! Note the non-standard time !!
Place:           R1107         !! Note the non-standard place !!
Abstract:
The supply and lifetime of gas and dust in circumstellar disks are among the primary determinants of the properties of young planetary systems. Most of the information on disk evolution has so far come from infrared surveys, which have established that hot dust in primordial disks dissipates in approximately 5-10 Myr. ALMA is now playing a central role in these studies by probing colder gas and dust in disks. In this talk, I present recent results from an ALMA survey of 106 disks in the Upper Sco OB association. At an age of 5 Myr, Upper Sco is a benchmark region to establish the properties of disks at the end state of their evolution. By comparing Upper Sco with disk properties in young regions, we can assess how the gas and dust in disks evolve on timescales of 5 Myr.
[This is a joint special seminar and planetary science group talk.]

> Topic:                Probing the relationship between Galaxies and Dark Matter with Lensing and Clustering in CFHTLenS/VIPERS
> Time:                 1/20 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20

> Abstract:
> I will present recent results on the connection between galaxies and dark matter haloes up to z=1, measured from a combined lensing and clustering analysis in the CFHTLS/VIPERS field. We obtained 30 deg2 of deep NIR data over the entire VIPERS area: whereas this program was initially designed to get robust stellar masses for the spectroscopic targets, we have shown that when properly calibrating photo-z's with spectro-z's and accounting for photo-z error in the modelling, one is able to get accurate constraints from projected clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing from a photometric sample. This significant increase in survey area for such depths and good lensing data allowed us to consistently probe the Mstar-Mh relation from the peak of the stellar-to-halo mass ratio (SHMR) up to the most massive clusters, a key asset to bring new insights on galaxy evolution.
