*** Colloquium ***

Speaker:        Hyosun Kim (ASIAA)
Topic:          Circumstellar Spirals/Shells/Arcs: the Messages from Evolved Stars
Time:           3/16 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Evolved stars are the birth places of the chemical elements, and their
extensive mass loss provides an important source of gas and dust to
the interstellar medium. An understanding of the late stellar
evolution and the nature of the mass loss process is important input
for studies of the chemical evolution of a galaxy and the formation of
next generations of stars. The shaping of the outflows is structured
exhibiting arcs, shells, and spirals. Ever since the first discovery
of a circumstellar spiral pattern of a heavily mass-losing evolved
star, a paradigm whereby such patterns are induced by the orbital
motions of the (postulated) central binary stars was emphasized. In
addition, many ring-like patterns observed for longer than a few
decades can be explained by the same spiral-shell pattern, but viewed
at different angles. Recent high-resolution high-sensitivity molecular
line maps from the ALMA and other sub-mm/mm interferometers facilitate
new detections of circumstellar spiral-like patterns, and therefore
the spirals/shells/arcs have led to a resurgence of interests. In this
colloquium, I will describe the impact of binaries on the evolution of
the late stages of stellar evolution. In particular, I suggest that
the coexistence of bipolar (or multipolar) structures and shell-like
patterns can both be understood within the framework of unified model.
