Dear colleagues,

I apology for the previous 'KaVA CfP 2016B' which was circulated about an
hour ago.
Here I send a revised version of KaVA Call for proposals.

kind regards,

Bong Won Sohn

********************************
 Call for Proposals of KaVA (KVN and VERA Array)
 Deadline:  1st November , 2016, 08:00 UT
*********************************

 Dear Colleagues.

 We invite proposals for the open use observations of the KaVA, a joint
VLBI array
 of the KVN (Korean VLBI Network) and the VERA (VLBI exploration of Radio
 Astrometry). The joint array consists of three 21-m KVN telescopes and
 four 20-m VERA telescopes, with baseline lengths ranging from 300 km to
2300 km.

 This open-use call will be based on risk-share, and provide VLBI
observations at
 22GHz and 43GHz for astronomers in the world.
 We support astronomers in the preparation of proposals, scheduling, and
data analysis.
 For that reason, proposers who are not familiar with KaVA are recommended
to include
 at least one collaborator from VERA or KVN. If it is difficult to find
collaborators
 from VERA or KVN, please consult us to find one. The contact address for
the support
 is kavaprop (at-mark) kasi.re.kr.

 In order to avoid conflict and/or duplication of the targets between
common use proposals
 and LPs, proposers are highly recommended to visit KaVA Large Pogram (LP)
webpage where
 KaVA LPs and their source list are presented (
http://radio.kasi.re.kr/kava/large_programs.php).
 If the common use proposals can not be achieved with the data of LPs,
 then they will be accepted as separate common use observations.
 Otherwise, we encourage the proposers to collaborate with the science
teams of
 the corresponding KaVA LPs.

 Observations will be conducted with single polarization (LCP) and 1-Gbps
data rate.
 The total available observation time is up to 250 hours and the
observations will be
 scheduled between 15th January 2017 and 15th June 2017. The maximum
observing
 time per proposal is limited to 48 hours.
 If requested in the proposals, the observation time can be allocated over
a year,
 until 15th January, 2018, for this call. But the maximum observation time
will be NOT increased.
 The deadline of submission is at 08:00 UT on 1st November 2016.
 More detailed information on the KaVA call-for-proposal can be found in
 http://radio.kasi.re.kr/kava/proposal_info.php

 ToO opportunity
 Target of Opportunity proposals can be submitted to regular CfP of KaVA.
 Also, unexpected or urgent ToO can be submitted Director's time at any
time.
 These proposals must include specific triggering criteria to initiate an
observation.
 The ToO is active one year from it is approved. The proposals to
Director's time must be
 submitted by PDF files using e-mail to kavaprop (at-mark) kasi.re.kr.

 If you have any questions, please send an email to kavaprop (at-mark)
kasi.re.kr

 Sincerely,


                     Hyun-Goo Kim
                     Director of Radio Astronomy Division, KASI
                        and
                     Mareki Honma
                     Director of Mizusawa VLBI Observatory, NAOJ

*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________
Speaker:        Wen-Ping Chen (National Central University)
Topic:          Formation and Dynamical Evolution of Star Clusters
Time:           9/21 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Stars are formed in clustered environments out of dense molecular cloud cores.
The initial spatial distribution of massive versus low-mass member stars is dictated
by the conditions in the molecular cloud.  Yet, there seems to be a universal origin
of stellar masses, the "initial mass function" among stellar systems including star clusters.  With time, via mutual gravitational interaction among member stars, the cluster is virialized and tends to become spherical.  The low-mass members, however, are vulnerable and prone to escaping from the system.  Furthermore, external Galactic perturbation act to disrupt the originally bound system, manifest by tidal tails and moving stellar groups.  Eventually all the members are dispersed and supply the disk population.    I will review the theories and our recent observational diagnosis regarding the formation and dynamical processes
of a star cluster, using photometric and kinematic data taken from sky survey projects supplied by our own imaging and spectroscopic observations.
