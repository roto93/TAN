Topic:          Gravitational unstable disks around FU Orionis objects?
Time:           2/24 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Young stellar objects (YSOs) may not accumulate their mass steadily, as was previously thought, but in a series of violent events manifesting themselves as sharp brightening events. These events can be caused by fragmentation due to gravitational instabilities in massive gaseous disks surrounding young stars, followed by migration of these dense gaseous clumps onto the star.  We report our high angular resolution, coronagraphic near-infrared polarization imaging observations using the High Contrast Instrument for the Subaru Next Generation Adaptive Optics  (HiCIAO) of the Subaru 8.2 m Telescope, towards four YSOs which are undergoing luminous accretion outbursts. The obtained infrared images have verified the presence of several hundred AUs scale arms and arcs surrounding these YSOs. In addition, our hydrodynamics simulations and radiative transfer models further demonstrate that these observed structures are indeed explained by strong gravitational instabilities occurring a!
 t the beginning of the disk formation phase. The apparently much smoother and older planet-forming disks may be merely the final products of these tempestuous and stochastic processes.
