*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________
Speaker:        Wen-Ping Chen (National Central University)
Topic:          Formation and Dynamical Evolution of Star Clusters
Time:           9/21 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Stars are formed in clustered environments out of dense molecular cloud cores.
The initial spatial distribution of massive versus low-mass member stars is dictated
by the conditions in the molecular cloud.  Yet, there seems to be a universal origin
of stellar masses, the "initial mass function" among stellar systems including star clusters.  With time, via mutual gravitational interaction among member stars, the cluster is virialized and tends to become spherical.  The low-mass members, however, are vulnerable and prone to escaping from the system.  Furthermore, external Galactic perturbation act to disrupt the originally bound system, manifest by tidal tails and moving stellar groups.  Eventually all the members are dispersed and supply the disk population.    I will review the theories and our recent observational diagnosis regarding the formation and dynamical processes
of a star cluster, using photometric and kinematic data taken from sky survey projects supplied by our own imaging and spectroscopic observations.
