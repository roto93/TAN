Topic:          Exploring the 5:1 Neptune Resonance: Dynamics, Population, and Origin
Time:           4/25 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
The long-term evolution of objects in the outer n:1 resonances with Neptune provide clues to the evolutionary history of the Solar System. Based on 4 objects with semi-major axes near the 5:1 Neptune resonance, we estimate a substantial and previously unrecognized population of objects, perhaps more significant than the population in the 3:2 (Plutino) resonance. Understanding the characteristics and trapping history for objects in these populations is critical for constraining the dynamical history of the solar system. The 4 objects detected in the Canada-France Ecliptic Plane Survey (CFEPS) were classified using dynamical integrations. Three are resonant, and the fourth appears to be a resonance diffusion object, part of a population which exited the resonance through chaotic diffusion.  The dynamical behavior of the known objects, suggests that the trapping mechanism for the 5:1 resonance is resonance sticking from the scattering objects.  However, our investigations of So!
 lar System evolution models show that they do not emplace a sufficiently large population into this resonance, and the source of this large population remains unexplained.

Topic:          The Co-evolution of AGNs and Galaxies, Viewed from 2D Spectroscopy
Time:           4/27 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
It is well-established that galaxies and their central supermassive black holes
co-evolve. The properties of AGN hosts and their interactions of, i.e. the feeding and feedback of AGNs, are key processes to understand these co-evolutions. In this talk, I will introduce some of our recent and ongoing work on the direct and indirect interactions of AGNs and their host galaxies, particularly using the data from 2D spectroscopy. I will also introduce our own 2D spectrograph, CHILI, and particularly its science implications. In the end, I will briefly mention our work that are not 2D-related, particularly the one that studies AGNs using infrared spectroscopy and explores high-z low-luminosity AGNs with the HETDEX survey.

Topic:          Models of Complex Molecule Formation in SpacE
Time:           4/29 (Friday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Pathways leading to the formation of complex organic molecules will be described. Gas phase processes that may build large carbon-chain species in cold molecular clouds will be summarised. Catalytic reactions on grain surfaces can lead to a large variety of organic species, and models of molecule formation by atom additions to multiply-bonded molecules will be presented. The subsequent desorption of these mixed molecular ices can initiate a distinctive organic chemistry in hot molecular cores.

The general ion-molecule pathways leading to even larger organics will be outlined. The predictions of this theory will be compared with observations to show how possible organic formation pathways in the interstellar medium may be constrained. In particular, the success of the theory in explaining trends in the known interstellar organics, in predicting recently-detected interstellar molecules, and, just as importantly, non-detections, will be discussed. The most urgently needed laboratory data required by these and future theoretical models, both for gas-phase and solid-phase reactions, will be emphasized.
