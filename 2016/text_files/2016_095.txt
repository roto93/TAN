Title:Two-Component Advective Flow Solution :
A Generalized Model to Understand Accretion
Flow Dynamics Around Black Holes

Abstract:
It has been more than two decades of the classic work by Chakrabarti and
his collaborators on
the two component advective flow (TCAF) model. Recently, we
successfully been able to include it in HEASARC's spectral analysis
software package XSPEC as an additive local model to fit energy
spectra from different black hole candidates (BHCs) and obtain
physical accretion flow parameters, such as, two component
(Keplerian disk and sub-Keplerian halo) accretion rates, shock
(location, i.e., the size of the Compton cloud, and the compression
ratio) parameters. Evolutions of spectral and timing properties are
transparent from the TCAF model fitted/derived physical
parameters. Reason of different spectral states and their transitions
during an outburst of a transient BHC are also clear. One can also
predict frequency of the dominating quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO)
from TCAF model fitted shock parameters and even predict most
preferable mass range of an unknown BHC from TCAF fits. To our
knowledge this gives us the most physical tool to investigate the
accretion flow dynamics around black hole candidates.
