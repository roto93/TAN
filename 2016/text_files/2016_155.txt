ALMA Band 1 Science Workshop, ASIAA, Taipei (Taiwan), 16-18 January 2017

First Announcement

The new ALMA Band 1 receiver is an ALMA development project lead by East
Asia
as a collaboration of ASIAA, NAOJ, NRAO, and the Universidad de Chile that
will provide access to the 35-51 GHz frequency window at high angular
resolution and sensitivity from the southern hemisphere.  Several key
science
cases have been proposed to be studied with the Band 1 Science Case aimed at
greatly increasing the volume of the observable Universe and the range of
observable frequencies and energies with ALMA.  The two main scientific
goals
of the ALMA Band 1 project are the study of the evolution of grains in
protoplanetary disks, from mm to cm sizes, and the detection of
molecular line
emission from high-redshift galaxies, tracing molecular emission from
redshifts z~1-10. Additionally, there is a broad range of science goals
covered by ALMA Band 1: high-resolution and high-sensitivity observations of
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZE) in galaxy clusters; observations of very
small
grains and spinning dust; study of the fine structure of chemical
differentiation in cloud cores, tracing the very cold phase of the ISM and
probing the smallest length scales of chemical variation; complex
carbon-chain
molecules, including the aminoacids and sugars from which life on Earth may
have originally evolved; the opportunity to measure the initial mass-to-flux
ratio of molecular cores through the detection of the Zeeman effect in
spectral lines (CCS), ...

The ALMA Band 1 Development Project was approved by the ALMA Board in April
2016. At this moment, the first three prototype receivers are being finished
and the production phase of the ALMA Band 1 receivers will start in early
2017.  The delivery of the last Band 1 receiver to ALMA is planned for
December 2019. The ALMA Band 1 Science workshop will provide the first
opportunity to show the exciting new science ALMA Band 1 can deliver and to
start preparing for the first observing proposals in the ALMA lowest
frequency
band.


The ALMA Band 1 Science Workshop will take place at the ASIAA (Academia
Sinica, Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics) in Taipei (Taiwan) from
January 16 to 18 2017. It will consist of a few invited talks on the main
scientific goals of ALMA Band 1, plus contributed talks. We also plan to
have
poster sessions.

The two days after the workshop, 19-20 January, will be dedicated to the
discussion and planning of the upcoming Band 1 Science Verification
phase. These closed sessions are in principle addressed to the members
of the
current SV team, but if you are interested in joining and/or in contributing
to the Science Verification of Band 1, please write to the Project Scientist
of Band 1, Oscar Morata (omorata@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw).

forms, please go to https://events.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/workshop/20170116/

*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________
Speaker:        Houjun Mo (UMass)
Topic:          Reconstructing the initial conditions to simulate the formation of the
local universe
Time:           9/27 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
I will describe a method that can be used to reconstruct the initial conditions of the local universe accurately. The method is applied to the SDSS volume. High-resolution simulations of the reconstructed initial conditions have been carried to recover of the formation histories and structures observed in the local universe.  I will also describe how the results can be used to study the formation and structure of the local cosmic web and of galaxies that are embedded in it.

Place:           R1203


*** Special Seminar ***
____________________________________________________
Speaker:        I-Ting Ho (Univ. Hawai'i & Australian National Univ.)
Topic:          Gas flows in star-forming galaxies in 3D
Time:           10/3 (Monday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Gas flows are one of the fundamental yet poorly understood processes driving galaxy evolution. This talk focuses on exploring gas flows in local galaxies by studying metallicity gradients and galactic-scale outflows in normal star-forming galaxies. This is made possible by new integral field spectroscopy data that provide simultaneously spatial and spectral information of galaxies. With the new 3D data, I study metallicity gradients and galactic winds to understand inflows and outflows in star-forming galaxies. I show that metallicity gradients in isolated disk galaxies are remarkably simple and universal. Simple chemical evolution models reveal that these simple metallicity gradients are a direct result of the coevolution of gas and stellar disk while galactic disks build up their masses from inside-out. Tight constraints on their mass outflow rates and inflow rates can be placed. I also investigate galactic winds in normal star-forming galaxies using data from the SAMI Gal!
 axy Survey. I show that galactic winds are found to be very common even in normal star-forming galaxies that were not expected to host winds. By comparing galaxies with and without hosting winds, I show that galaxies with high star formation rate surface densities and bursty star formation histories are more likely to develop large-scale galactic winds.

Topic:          Ultraluminous Supersoft X-ray sources as super-critical accretion onto stellar black holes
Time:           10/4 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
While ultraluminous supersoft X-ray sources (ULSs) bear features for intermediate mass black holes or very massive white dwarfs possibly close to Chandrasekhar mass limit, our recent discovery of processing relativistic baryonic jets from a prototype ULS in M81 demonstrate that they are not IMBHs or WDs, but black holes accreting at super-Eddington rates. This discovery strengthens the recent ideas that ULXs are stellar black holes with supercritical accretion,as demonstrated in the case of M101 ULX-1, and provides a vivid manifestation of what happens when a black hole devours too much, that is, it will generate thick disk winds and fire out sub-relativistic baryonic jets along the funnel as predicted by recent numerical  simulations.


*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________
Speaker:        Eva Villaver (Autonomous University of Madrid)
Topic:          Single rotating stars and their AGB winds
Time:           10/5 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Heavy modulated mass-loss takes place during the Asymptotic Giant Branch evolution of low-and intermediate-mass stars.  In the process several processes play their role: metallicity, stellar mass, rotation, magnetic fields, the presence of companions and a possible interaction with the ISM.  I will describe how our new stellar evolution models with rotation can  rule out single main sequence stars to achieve the needed physical conditions to cause asymmetrical mass-loss. We have quantified under which circumstances the presence of companions can induce sufficient tidal spin-up to form bipolar Planetary Nebulae. Finally, by computing models of star-planet interactions we have explored the role that substellar companions have in the overall stellar evolution and thus how they might influence PNe properties.

Title: Investigations of AGNs: From Seyfert to QSOs

Abstract:
The reason of non-detection of polarized broad-line regions (BLRs) in
some Seyfert 2 galaxies (non-HBLR) remains a mystery. Using integral field
unit OSIRIS of Keck plus adaptive optics, we probe local Seyfert 2
galaxies down to scales of 5-30 parsecs. With these K-band data, we can
study nuclear stellar populations, molecular gas, and ionized
gas within the central few hundred parsecs of the HBLR and non-HBLR
Seyfert2 galaxies.

Furthermore, some QSOs have the similar phenomena; the BLRs disappear
in changing-look QSOs with the decreasing of continuum flux.
The mechanisms causing the disappearance of BLRs are still unclear.
To extend the sample, we have searched for changing-look QSOs using
photometric data of Palomar Transient Factory (PTF), Sloan Digital
Sky Survey (SDSS), and Pan-STARRS, along with the spectra of SDSS and
LAMOST. I will also present preliminary results of our survey.
