Title:
Photometric redshifts for X-ray selected AGNs: paving the way towards the
study of AGN/galaxy coevolution

Abstract:

To better investigate the AGN and galaxies coevolution, we need to have a
complete characterisation and census of AGNs with accurate redshifts.
Spectroscopic redshifts are relatively reliable, however, it is
time-consuming and difficult to be obtained for faint sources at high
redshifts. Therefore we have to rely on photometric redshifts (photo-z)
which need to be tuned specifically for AGNs. In our work, we studied on
the X-ray selected AGNs in the Chandra deep filed-south (CDFS) region,
mainly using de-blending Subaru intermediate bands and HST
optical/near-infrared data to compute photo-z. We first matched the
multi-wavelength counterparts for the X-ray sources, then applied proper
magnitude priors and appropriate AGN-galaxy hybrid templates for SED
fitting. We achieved a photo-z accuracy of 0.013 with an outliers fraction
of 5.3% for X-ray sources. With the SED fitting results of our well-trained
AGN-galaxy hybrids, we further studied the AGN host properties via the
rest-frame color-magnitude diagram (CMD) which is an useful probe to trace
the stellar populations. We made corrections for dust extinction and AGN
contamination for the AGN host colors, and found that the AGN host colors
also present a bimodality in the CMD up to z~2.5 as found in normal
galaxies. In this talk, I will present the CMD result of AGN host colors,
and compare with the result of normal galaxies.
