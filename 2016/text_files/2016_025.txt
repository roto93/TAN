 Please note that "Time Available for Large Programs" has been changed=20=

from what is explained in EA ALMA Science workshop in Osaka.

Definition of a Large Program
Large Programs are defined as projects that request more than 50 hours=20=

of observations with either the 12-m Array or the Morita Array (a.k.a.
the ALMA Compact Array, or ACA) in stand-alone mode. Large Programs for
the 12-m Array may include ACA for short-spacing observations as needed.

Time Available for Large Programs
It is anticipated that 3000 hours will be offered for the 12m Array and=20=

1800 hours for the ACA in Cycle 4. Up to 15% of this time may be
allocated to Large Programs; i.e., 450 hours for the 12m Array and 270
hours for ACA stand-alone.

See URL above for details.

 Sincerely,
 Shigehisa Takakuwa, on behalf of ALMA Taiwan=
