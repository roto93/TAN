---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Second Announcement of the ALMA Band 1 Science Workshop, ASIAA, Taipei
    (Taiwan), 16-18 January 2017
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The ALMA Band 1 Science Workshop will take place at the ASIAA (Academia
  Sinica, Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics) in Taipei (Taiwan) from
  January 16 to 18 2017. It will consist of a few invited talks on the main
  scientific goals of ALMA Band 1, plus contributed talks. We also plan
to have
  poster sessions. The ALMA Band 1 Science workshop will provide the first
  opportunity to show the exciting new science ALMA Band 1 can deliver
and to
  start preparing for the first observing proposals in the ALMA lowest
  frequency band.

  The two days after the workshop, 19-20 January, will be dedicated to the
  discussion and planning of the upcoming Band 1 Science Verification
  phase. These sessions are mainly addressed to the members of the
current SV
  team, but if you are interested in joining and/or in contributing to the
  Science Verification of Band 1, please write to the Project Scientist
of Band
  1, Oscar Morata (omorata@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw), so you can be added
  to the list.


IMPORTANT DEADLINES
-------------------

   - deadline for abstract submission: December 1st, 2016
   - deadline for hotel reservations: December 14th, 2016
   - deadline for registration: January 1st, 2017


SCIENTIFIC GOAL
---------------

  Several key science cases have been proposed to be studied with the Band 1
  Science Case aimed at greatly increasing the volume of the observable
  Universe and the range of observable frequencies and energies with
ALMA. The
  two main scientific goals of the ALMA Band 1 project are the study of the
  evolution of grains in protoplanetary disks, from mm to cm sizes, and the
  detection of molecular line emission from high-redshift galaxies, tracing
  molecular emission from redshifts z~1-10. Additionally, there is a broad
  range of science goals covered by ALMA Band 1: high-resolution and
  high-sensitivity observations of Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZE) in galaxy
  clusters; observations of very small grains and spinning dust; study
of the
  fine structure of chemical differentiation in cloud cores, tracing the
very
  cold phase of the ISM and probing the smallest length scales of chemical
  variation; complex carbon-chain molecules, including the aminoacids and
  sugars from which life on Earth may have originally evolved; the
opportunity
  to measure the initial mass-to-flux ratio of molecular cores through the
  detection of the Zeeman effect in spectral lines (CCS), ...

*** Colloquium ***

Speaker:        Erik Rosolowsky (University of Alberta)
Topic:          The Care and Feeding of Star Forming Regions
Time:           11/9 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
In the local Universe, all stars form in clouds of molecular gas.  On the largest scales in galaxies, the ensemble of molecular clouds produces a simple star formation law: more molecular gas is linearly correlated with more star formation.  This star formation law must emerge from behaviour of groups of individual molecular clouds.  In this talk, I will present recent observations of molecular clouds and star forming regions in our Galaxy.  Using a suite of novel analysis approaches, we are able to untangle maps of molecular gas and match them to the regions of star formation.  This analysis finds good evidence that significant mass flows are essential for feeding star forming regions across the Galactic disk.  Additionally, higher mass molecular clouds show evidence for increased rates of star formation, suggesting again these clouds are fed from their environment over their lifetime.  The large apparent scatter in the efficiency of the star formation process can be attrib!
 uted in part to viewing the effects of this mass accretion over time.

Title: The Nearby Spiral Density-Wave Structure of the Galaxy

Abstract:
Distances and velocities of coeval groups of objects in our Galaxy --
star-forming regions, OB associations, HII regions and long-period
Cepheids -- were recently measured. Within the Lin--Shu density-wave
proposal for the galactic spiral structure, we use these new data to
find both the geometrical and physical parameters of the wave structure
within a few kiloparsecs from the Sun. It is also proposed that better
data samples provided by Gaia mission could reveal in the near future
whether the wave structure near the Sun reported here does indeed exist.

Tea/Discussion Time is followed !  All Welcome !!
