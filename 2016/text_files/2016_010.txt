Dear Kingmen and others:

     Thank you so much for keeping us informed.

     In fact, all of us, particle physicists and alike, should think about
these things (problems) in terms of the Standard Model.

     Let's start from quantum fields (particles). The only missing link is
about \lambda (\phi^\dagger \phi)^2, the only renormalizable left-over for
the complex scalar field \phi, in the 4-dimensional Minkowski space-time.
This lambda (=1/8?) is dimensionless in the 4-dimensional Minkowski
space-time and lambda should be determined by the governing space-time in
view of its dimensionlessness. Since lambda = +1/8, it is self-repulsive -
thus it cannot exist by itself.

     The Higgs fields exist in pairs: phi(1,2) (Standard-Model Higgs),
phi(3,2) (mixed family Higgs), and phi(3,1) (purely family Higgs), the
first label SU_f(3) while the second the electroweak SU_L(2). They are
maximally attractive in pair - just enough to overcome the
self-repulsiveness. These fields are just enough to make the eight family
gauge bosons massive as well as to make four family Higgs bosons.

      The quark world has the (123) symmetry (SU_c(3) x SU_L(2) x U(1)).
The lepton world also has the other (weaker) (123) symmetry (SU_L(2) x
U(1) x SU_f(3)). They are free of Landau ghosts, and asymptotically free.
Thus, well-behaved in the r => 0 limit.

      In fact, in this 21st century, we can declare that we live in the
quantum 4-dimensional Minkowski space-time with the gauge-group structure
SU_c(3) x SU_L(2) x U(1) x SU_f(3) built-in from the very beginning. Why
built-in from the very beginning? We could ask the 3^\circ K cosmic
microwave background (CMB) for the answer.

                         Best wishes to you all, Pauchy
