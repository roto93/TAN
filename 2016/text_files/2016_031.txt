Dear Taiwanese community members,

    CFHT is now accepting proposals for the 2016B semester. The
deadline is March 16 2016 23:59 UTC. Consult this URL for more
information:

http://cfht.hawaii.edu/en/science/Proposals/

Please note that if you are interested in using the old MegaCam
filters, you need to make a strong scientific case for this in the
proposal.

Also, we encourage our users to submit bright time proposals for the
16B semester since we had an undersubscription of bright time programs
for the 2016A semester.

As usual, we encourage people to submit snapshot programs.

You will find more details on these items on the above mentioned website.

Good luck to all the proposers.

Daniel Devost for the CFHT team.
