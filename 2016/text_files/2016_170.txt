Topic:          Collimated and precessing outflows in a high-mass star forming core: a massive binary or multiple star
Time:           10/31 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Most stars form in binary or multiple systems, but how such stars come into birth is poorly understood. This is particularly true for high-mass stars. It is very difficult to directly image high-mass binaries or multiples in formation, because they are distant, deeply embedded, and in a clustered and complex environment. Observations of parsec sized outflows or jets could be a useful probe to the central multiplicity, and the morphological and kinematical structures of the outflows may provide valuable insights into the formation mechanism of the central binaries or multiples. Here I shall talk about our high resolution observations of collimated and precessing outflows in a high-mass star forming core, and discuss about how these observations help us to understand the formation of the central proto-binary or triple star.

Topic:          Comet composition : clues to Solar System formation
Time:           10/31 (Monday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
The composition of cometary ices provides clues to the chemistry and conditions prevailing in the early solar system. Since the detection of HCN at millimeter wavelengths in comet C/1973 E1 (Kohoutek),  almost 30 molecules have been identified in cometary atmospheres from remote sensing observations from ground or from space platforms. Thanks to progresses in instrumentation and the availability of large telescopes, complex organic molecules have been identified. Measurements will be reviewed and the observed chemical diversity among comets will be presented. The relative abundances will be compared to values measured in star-forming regions to discuss the possible formation routes of cometary molecules. The talk will also present new findings about comet composition obtained from the Rosetta mission to comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko.

Topic:          Dust and molecules in Supernova 1987A
Time:           11/1 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Supernovae (SNe) play a crucial role in the chemical evolution of galaxies by enriching their interstellar media (ISM) with heavy elements and dust.

The formation of dust in core-collapse supernovae (SNe) is one of the unresolved issues in the chemical and physical evolution of supernovae. I will present Herschel Space Observatoryâ€™s discovery of a large dust reservoir in SN 1987A. The estimated dust mass is 0.1-1 solar masses, which are typically 1000 times higher than previously thought. A significant fraction of the elements synthesized by the supernova can condense into dust grains. That suggests that SNe may be important source of dust in ISM of galaxies.

With ALMA, we discovered CO, SiO, HCO+ and SO lines in SN 1987A. The observations can probe insight of molecular chemistry, leading dust formation in SN. In millimetre wavelength, isotopologue lines appear at separated wavelengths, enabling constraining isotope ratios of 28Si/29Si and 28Si/30Si. ALMA can provide crucial limit on nuclear synthesis in high mass stars and supernovae.

Topic:          Study of protoplanetary disks at millimeter wavelength
Time:           11/2 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
The study of protoplanetary disks is essential to constrain the planets formation mechanism. Because these disks are small and cold objects, (sub)millimeter interferometry is a key to unveil their physical conditions, providing us with information on both the dust and gas content. However, one needs physical and chemical models to interpret the observations. In this talk I will present recent results based on observations with the IRAM instruments and ALMA.
