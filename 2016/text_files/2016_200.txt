Speaker:        Hiroyuki Hirashita (ASIAA)
Topic:          SED fitting to galaxies using Cigale
Time:           12/19 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
While I stayed in Marseille in November, I learned how to use an spectral (SED) fitting code, Cigale. I will briefly talk about it and introduce our plan of an application to Lyman break galaxies at high redshift.


*** Special Seminar ***
____________________________________________________
Speaker:        Hsin-Yu Chen (University of Chicago)
Topic:          Cosmology and Astrophysics with Gravitational-Wave Observations
Time:           12/20 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
The first detections of gravitational waves by LIGO-Virgo initiated the era of Gravitation-Wave Astronomy. Gravitational-waves serve as a new and independent probe of the Universe. In addition, the combination of gravitational-waves with information from other messengers, such as electromagnetic emission from the same source, will lead to a more complete and accurate understanding of cosmology and astrophysics. In this talk, I will discuss what we learned from the LIGO-Virgo first observing run, and what scientific goals we expect to reach in the next few years.


*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________
Speaker:        Siyi Xu (ESO)
Topic:          Planetary Systems around White Dwarfs
Time:           12/21 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Recent studies have shown that extrasolar planetary systems are prevalent around main-sequence stars in the Milky Way. However, little is known about their fate towards the end of the stellar evolution. In this talk, I will show various evidence that some white dwarfs are dynamically active and planetary systems could be prevalent around white dwarfs. I will also talk about the recent discovery of an actively disintegrating asteroid around a white dwarf and how this system fits into our overall understanding of the fate of planetary systems.
