Dear AGN researchers in Taiwan,

There will be the East-Asia AGN Workshop 2016 in Seoul, Korea.
If you are studying whatever AGN related topic, please consider
to join.  In the last workshop, there was only one researcher
from Taiwan, so they are hoping more researchers attend from
Taiwan.  If you are interested in, please join the meeting.

Cheers,
Satoki

*************************************************


It is our pleasure to announce 'East-Asia AGN Workshop 2016â€™, which will be
held on 22-24 September 2016 in Seoul, Korea. Since the first kick-off
workshop
in 2012, we annually hosted the EA-AGN workshop, which is intended to
encourage close collaborations among AGN researchers in East Asia.
Fostering collaborations and developing the network at the current stage is
important as we enter the era of large international projects, including GMT
and TMT, not to mention the current EA effort on the ALMA and JCMT.

The conference will be on the Seoul National University campus, which can be
easily reached from either Seoul-Incheon airport or Gimpo airport. We
reserved a block of rooms at the Hoam Guest House, which is conveniently
located on SNU campus.

We would strongly encourage you to participate. Please feel free to ask
about the workshop.

On behalf of the SOC,
Jong-Hak Woo
