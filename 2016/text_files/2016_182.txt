SPICA-Taiwan 2 Kick-off meeting

Taiwan has once again, through ASIAA, been invited by the SPICA consortium
to join the project. We are joining through both Europe (SAFARI consortium,
led by SRON) and Japan (SMI consortium). The SPICA project is approved to
go ahead to phase A on the Japanese side, and currently under review with
ESA. The hope is that ESA will also allow SPICA to go ahead to phase A, and
this should become clear in the beginning of 2017. ESA approval is
essential, as it comes with 550 M EUR of funding.

Now that Taiwan is back in the consortium, it is time to start thinking
again what kind of science we are interested in, given the revised design
of the telescope and the instrument suite in comparison to 3 years ago.
There will be a half day meeting to discuss the project at ASIAA, but if
interest is large, it may be extended to a full day meeting. Please
indicate your availability to come to meet at ASIAA at this doodle poll:

http://doodle.com/poll/65eppphq7b9w5sth

There is a mailing list related to this project. Please email Ciska Kemper
at ciska@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw if you want to be included in this mailing
list.

Finally, if you have any scientific ideas of what you would like to do with
SPICA, feel free to email Ciska Kemper as well, to schedule a talk at the
meeting.

MEETING TITLE:
Cosmic Dust

WEBSITE:
https://www.cps-jp.org/~dust/

VENUE:
Mitaka Campus of National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ)
2-21-1 Osawa, Mitaka
Tokyo 181-8588
JAPAN

DATE:
Monday, August 14 =E2=80=93 Friday, August 18, 2017

OBJECTIVES:
This series of Cosmic Dust meetings aims at finding a consensus among
experts on the formation and evolution of cosmic dust: where it comes from
and where it goes. The meeting is organized by dust freaks who are very
enthusiastic not only to make the goal achievable but also to establish a
dust community across every scientifically relevant discipline for the
development of cosmic dust research. For this reason, the primary objective
of the meeting is to bring together professionals who deal with cosmic dust
as well as provide an opportunity for participants to develop interpersonal
relationships and scientific interactions among themselves.

SCOPE:
All kinds of cosmic dust such as
=E2=80=A2 intergalactic dust
=E2=80=A2 circumnuclear dust
=E2=80=A2 interstellar dust
=E2=80=A2 protoplanetary disk dust
=E2=80=A2 debris disk dust
=E2=80=A2 cometary dust
=E2=80=A2 interplanetary dust
=E2=80=A2 circumplanetary dust
=E2=80=A2 stellar nebular condensates
=E2=80=A2 presolar grains
=E2=80=A2 micrometeorites
=E2=80=A2 meteoroids
=E2=80=A2 meteors
=E2=80=A2 regolith particles
=E2=80=A2 planetary aerosols
are the subject of discussion. The meeting is open for any aspects of dust
research by means of different methods of studies (in-situ and laboratory
measurements, astronomical observations, laboratory and numerical
simulations, theoretical modeling, data analyses, etc.). Also welcome are
papers on dust-related topics, for example:
=E2=80=A2 the formation of molecules and their reactions on and their desor=
ption
from the surface of a solid substance
=E2=80=A2 light scattering by non-spherical particles and particulate surfa=
ces
=E2=80=A2 space missions and instrumentation for measurements of particulat=
es

BRIEF HISTORY:
The Cosmic Dust meeting started in 2006 as a session called =E2=80=9CCosmic=
 Dust=E2=80=9D
of the 3rd AOGS (Asia-Oceania Geoscience Society) annual meeting in
Singapore. Dust freaks have kept on organizing the session at subsequent
AOGS meetings in Korea (2008), India (2010), and Taiwan (2011). The Cosmic
Dust series has been recognized as the most successful session of the AOGS
Planetary Sciences Section. In 2012, the time was ripe to be free from
organizing restrictions on the AOGS meeting. From that time on, the Cosmic
Dust meeting is totally independent of any international conference. The
past meetings on Cosmic Dust have been held in a relaxed and joyful
atmosphere. So will be the coming one!=EF=BF=BC

*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________
Speaker:        Christian Fendt (Max Planck Institute for Astronomy)
Topic:          How to make astrophysical jets?
Time:           11/16 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
I will present MHD simulations investigating the launching of
astrophysical jets.
First, a brief introduction into MHD wind and jets is given.

Our simulations treat the time-dependent evolution of the
accretion-ejection structure and the subsequent collimation of the disk
wind into a high-velocity jet.
The setup considers various models  for a  physical  (turbulent) magnetic
diffusivity that is essential for the mass loading of the outflow. We find
relatively high mass fluxes in the outflow, about 20-40% of the accretion
rate.

Recent simulations include a mean-field accretion disk dynamo and the
launching of outflows by a self-generated disk magnetic field.
We have run a parameter survey of disk-wind launched by disk of different
magnetization and find that the disk magnetization is the main parameter
that governs the jet dynamics.

Special relativistic jet formation simulations allow to construct
synchrotron radiation maps from the dynamical outflow structure that can
be compared to  the observations.
Finally I will present preliminary results from GR-MHD simulations
treating the accretion-ejection structure of outflows from resistive
accretion disks.

Title: The Neptune Trojans and the Vertical Moving
        Trans-Neptunian Objects

Abstract:
Many primitive bodies exist in the vast regions of the solar system beyond
Jupiter, of which the largest population is the trans-Neptunian objects
(TNOs). The details of the orbital distribution of the TNOs preserve
information about the evolution of the solar system.

In this talk, I will introduce our two recent works, which are related
to TNO studies: 1. The Neptune Trojans: dynamically very hot or not that hot?
and 2. The vertical moving TNOs: is there a perpendicular Kuiper Belt?

Currently 17 Neptune Trojans (NTs), the asteroids in co-orbital 1:1 mean
motion resonance with Neptune, have been found. The very high and wide
orbital inclination distribution of NTs implies an unusual formation
mechanism of NTs; the NT have to be captured from a pre-excited planetesimal
disk. Recently, we used Pan-STARRS 1 (PS1) survey data to study the
orbital distribution of NTs and found that the inclination distribution
is rather low compare with the results of previous studies. The new result
may suggest that NTs can be captured from a planetesimal disk without
pre-excited.

In the PS1 survey data, we also identified an unusual TNOs, 2011 KT13
(nicknamed Niku). This object has an 110 degree orbital inclination; it
has a retrograde and almost vertical moving orbit. Together with other
five high-inclination TNOs, the six vertical moving objects appear to
occupy a common orbital plane. We found that this alignment is statistical
significant; the probability occurring by chance is only 0.016%. Our simple
simulations including the hypothetical Planet Nine fail to maintain the
common orbital plane, therefore, an unknown mechanism is required to
explain the observed clustering.

Tea/Discussion Time is followed !  All Welcome !!
