Dear all,

This is a reminder.
Please register the summer school as soon as possible, if you or your students/postdocs are considering to attend.
The registration is almost full. There are only less than 10 seats left.
We might close the registration much earlier than the original deadline.

Thanks for your attention.

Tangtang.
