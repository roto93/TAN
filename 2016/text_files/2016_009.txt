The 2016 Scientific Assembly of the Astronomical Society of the
Republic of China (ASROC2016) will be held at National Cheng Kung
University on May 13 (Friday)  15 (Sunday), 2016.  This is an annual
event for all astronomers and astrophysicists in Taiwan to present
their most recent discoveries and observations, to report their latest
research results and to exchange ideas, also to organize
collaborations when desirable.  Oral presentations and conference
posters in all areas of astronomy and astrophysics are solicited.
ASROC2016 is also an excellent venue for students, in particular
graduate students, to present their research findings or progress from
their thesis studies.

The meeting will include plenary talks, scientific and educational
sessions, poster presentation, and a business meeting.  The featured
plenary speakers are 1) Prof. Harold A. Weaver, Jr. of Johns Hopkins
University.  Prof. Weaver is the New Horizons project scientist at the
Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, where he joined
the staff in May 2002.  He was also the co-leader of the team that
used the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) to find two new moons in the
Pluto system.  His research interests include comets, planets and
their satellites, and formation and evolution of planetary systems.
His plenary talk will be ¨New Horizons: Mission to Pluto.〃
2) Mr. Zolt G. Levay of Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI).
Mr. Levay is a member of the Hubble Heritage Team and has developed software
for astronomical data display and analysis.  He works with scientists at
the STScI and around the world to process HST images and present them
in a form that is aesthetic and educational to the general public as
well as inspiring and thought-provoking to scientists.  Mr. Levay was
awarded an STScI Individual Achievement Award in 1997.  He will
present ¨The Heritage of Hubble Space Telescope.〃
