ALMA Band 1 Science Workshop, ASIAA, Taipei (Taiwan), 16-18 January 2017

First Announcement

The new ALMA Band 1 receiver is an ALMA development project lead by East
Asia
as a collaboration of ASIAA, NAOJ, NRAO, and the Universidad de Chile that
will provide access to the 35-51 GHz frequency window at high angular
resolution and sensitivity from the southern hemisphere.  Several key
science
cases have been proposed to be studied with the Band 1 Science Case aimed at
greatly increasing the volume of the observable Universe and the range of
observable frequencies and energies with ALMA.  The two main scientific
goals
of the ALMA Band 1 project are the study of the evolution of grains in
protoplanetary disks, from mm to cm sizes, and the detection of
molecular line
emission from high-redshift galaxies, tracing molecular emission from
redshifts z~1-10. Additionally, there is a broad range of science goals
covered by ALMA Band 1: high-resolution and high-sensitivity observations of
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZE) in galaxy clusters; observations of very
small
grains and spinning dust; study of the fine structure of chemical
differentiation in cloud cores, tracing the very cold phase of the ISM and
probing the smallest length scales of chemical variation; complex
carbon-chain
molecules, including the aminoacids and sugars from which life on Earth may
have originally evolved; the opportunity to measure the initial mass-to-flux
ratio of molecular cores through the detection of the Zeeman effect in
spectral lines (CCS), ...

The ALMA Band 1 Development Project was approved by the ALMA Board in April
2016. At this moment, the first three prototype receivers are being finished
and the production phase of the ALMA Band 1 receivers will start in early
2017.  The delivery of the last Band 1 receiver to ALMA is planned for
December 2019. The ALMA Band 1 Science workshop will provide the first
opportunity to show the exciting new science ALMA Band 1 can deliver and to
start preparing for the first observing proposals in the ALMA lowest
frequency
band.


The ALMA Band 1 Science Workshop will take place at the ASIAA (Academia
Sinica, Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics) in Taipei (Taiwan) from
January 16 to 18 2017. It will consist of a few invited talks on the main
scientific goals of ALMA Band 1, plus contributed talks. We also plan to
have
poster sessions.

The two days after the workshop, 19-20 January, will be dedicated to the
discussion and planning of the upcoming Band 1 Science Verification
phase. These closed sessions are in principle addressed to the members
of the
current SV team, but if you are interested in joining and/or in contributing
to the Science Verification of Band 1, please write to the Project Scientist
of Band 1, Oscar Morata (omorata@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw).
