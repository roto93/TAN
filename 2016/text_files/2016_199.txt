Dear all

the program of the ALMA Band 1 Science workshop that will be held at
ASIAA in Taipei during 16--18 January 2017 is already online:

https://events.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/workshop/20170116/program.php

We want to remind you that *** registration is still open until January
1st 2017***. If you are interested in attending the workshop, especially
if you are in Taiwan, please register before the deadline.

We will dedicate Thursday 19th and Friday 20th January to the discussion
of the Band 1 Science Verification. If you plan on attending and have
not yet told us, please get in touch with Oscar Morata
(omorata@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw). The SV meeting will be held in ASIAA
R1107, which has a relatively low limited seating space and we would
like to know how many extra people are intending to to come.

Finally, we are studying the possibility of providing remote access to
the SV meeting, we will provide more details if we find an appropriate
way of doing it.

Best regards,
    Oscar Morata
    ALMA Band 1 Project Scientist
    on behalf of the SOC
