Two ALMA postdoctoral positions in Taiwan - JRID57596

The UCAT (University Consortium of ALMA-Taiwan) invites applications for 2 postdoctoral positions working on ALMA-related sciences.

Taiwan has joined the ALMA project through collaborations with Japan and North America. To promote ALMA research in Universities, UCAT is formed by seven leading universities in radio astronomy in Taiwan - National Tsing Hua University, National Central University, National Taiwan Normal University, National Taiwan University, National Cheng Kung University, National Sun Yat-sen University, and Tamkang University. Areas of research interests of the UCAT faculty include star formation, astrochemistry, active galaxies, galaxy evolution, solar system, and cosmology. More information can be found at our homepage (http://alma.astr.nthu.edu.tw/).

Scientists with radio interferometry background are preferred; however, all candidates with a PhD in any area of astronomy interested to conduct research using ALMA are encouraged to apply. UCAT postdoctoral fellows are expected to conduct their research at one of the seven UCAT universities. Being in a Taiwanese research institute, UCAT postdoctoral fellows have the privilege to apply for Taiwan�¦s share of observing time for ALMA, SMA, CFHT, JCMT, SMT and the 12m of ARO.

The UCAT postdoc appointments will initially be for two years, with possible extension for additional years. Successful applicants are expected to start no later than August 1, 2017. Please submit (1) a curriculum vitae, (2) a publication list, (3) a brief summary of past research experiences, (4) a future research plan, and (5) have three letters of recommendation sent to Prof. Vivien Chen (hchen@phys.nthu.edu.tw) by January 15, 2017 for full consideration.

Dear colleague,

The deadline for the ASIAA postdoc application has been updated
to Dec. 15 (Thu.), 2016.

Postdoctoral Positions in Observation, Theory, or Instrumentation

The Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA) has openings for postdoctoral positions. Candidates who work in (a) Optical/IR/Radio astronomy, (b) Theoretical/Computational Astrophysics, or (c) Instrumentation (optical/IR/submillimeter) are especially encouraged to apply. Applicants should hold a Ph.D. degree in astronomy/astrophysics, physics, engineering or equivalent fields. Those who are expecting to receive a PhD degree soon can also apply.

ASIAA is an institute of Academia Sinica, the leading national research organization of Taiwan. The Institute has approximately 200 members. Research topics include the Solar and Exoplanetary Systems, Star and Planet Formation, Interstellar medium and Astrochemistry, Stars and Compact Objects, Galactic Dynamics, Active Galaxies, Galaxy Evolution, Cosmology, and Instrumentation Developments.

ASIAA has access to forefront radio observing facilities. ASIAA operates the SMA in collaboration with the SAO, and is a partner institution in the ALMA project through collaborations with East Asia and North America. In August 2016, ASIAA established the ASIAA CASA (Common Astronomy Software Applications) Development Center (ACDC). ASIAA is also a member of EACOA (East Asian Core Observatories Association) and has access to the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope. The Y.T. Lee Array on Mauna Loa is being modified for intensity mapping observations of CO rotational transitions. A retrofitted ALMA-NA prototype telescope is now being deployed to Greenland for submm VLBI observations of shadows of supermassive black holes and related sciences, as well as single-dish THz observations.

ASIAA has gained access to the CFHT, Subaru Telescope, and associated surveys, such as the Hyper Suprime-Cam survey (HSC), through participation in instrumentation developments. The TAOS-2 project, consisting of three 1.3m telescope located at San Pedro Mártir in Mexico, will see first light in 2016 and conduct a survey of small objects beyond Neptune and other time-domain sciences. ASIAA is also an Associate Institutional Member of the SDSS-IV project, which is an on-going program to study the Milky Way, the nearby galaxy population, and large-scale structure with the APOGEE, MaNGA, and eBOSS surveys, respectively.

Theoretical and computational astrophysics is pursued in our theoretical division, TIARA (Theoretical Institute for Advanced Research in Astrophysics). The CHARMS initiative incubated by TIARA, for example, aims to develop numerical simulators to bridge observations and theories in fluid dynamics, chemistry, and radiative transfer.

ASIAA offers excellent research facilities (more details in our Home Page) and an international environment (~55 foreign members from 18 countries), where English is the working language.  We seek candidates who will actively participate in the Institute's projects, in particular: (1) optical/IR astronomers to pursue research topics related to Institute interests (e.g., HSC, PFS, and/or SDSS-IV); (2) radio astronomers to pursue scientific observations or participate in ongoing tests and software-developments with ALMA, SMA, VLBI or Y.T. Lee Array; (3) solar system or planetary astronomers to participate in the study of small objects beyond Neptune through TAOS-2; (4) scientists or engineers to participate in instrumentation development for Optical/IR telescopes or radio telescopes; or (5) scientists with backgrounds in astrophysics or planetary sciences to pursue topics in theoretical astrophysics, computational fluid dynamics, or MHD. More information on targeted areas of r!
 ecruitment can be found at ASIAA Job Opening.

The postdoc appointments at ASIAA will initially be for two years, with possible extension for additional two years based on satisfactory performance.

Applicants should apply online and submit (1) a curriculum vitae, (2) publication list, (3) a summary of past and current research (or instrumentation experience), and (4) a plan for future research. Applicants are also requested to arrange three letters of recommendation to be submitted online at the same site. Applications submitted by or on 15 December 2016 will receive full consideration.

        and protostellar disk formation

Speaker B: Hao-Yuan Duan (NTHU)

Title: Searching the First Hydrostatic Core Candidates.

Abstract:
First Hydrostatic Cores (FHCs) are the transient phase between
prestellar cores and Class 0 protostars. It is a key to
understand the earliest stage of star formation. Recently,
some potential candidates of FHCs have been suggested, but
not enough to enable statistical property studies.

In the talk, I will summarize the papers which propose candidates
of FHCs. I will also talk about my recently work on searching
FHCs candidates in Perseus molecular cloud.
