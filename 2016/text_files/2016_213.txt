> National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ) and East Asian Core =
Observatory Association (EACOA) are jointly organizing a 3-day workshop =
on Astrostatistics for students and astronomers in East Asia on February =
28 to March 2, 2017. The workshop =E2=80=9CAstrostatistics and R=E2=80=9D =
that will be held at NAOJ, Mitaka campus, Tokyo, Japan. This workshop is =
opened to students and astronomers in East Asia who have interests in =
practical use of statistics and of state-of-the-art statistical tools =
applicable to astrophysical problems.
> =20
> The main purpose of this workshop is to provide the graduate students =
and post-docs in Japan, as well as other East Asian countries, with an =
opportunity to learn the analysis and evaluation process of the modern =
astronomical data. The workshop will be modeled on previous Penn State =
Summer Schools. Professor Eric Feigelson (Penn State University) will be =
the instructor of the workshop.
> =20
> The number of participants will be limited to ~40-50 (due to the =
availability of the lecture room space) in total. The selection will be =
made by the organizers, graduate students and young post-docs will be =
given preference if the applications exceed the above limitations. Some =
travel support will be provided to cover the expenses for participating =
the workshop. If you need the travel support, please notify it in the =
application form. To apply to the workshop, please fill the application =
