Dear Prof. Kuan:

We are organizing a symposium to celebrate Prof. Wing-Huen Ip's 70th
birthday next year. Please help to circulate the following announcement in
the TAN. Thanks a lot.

****** First Announcement *******
We are organizing a symposium to honor Prof. Wing-Huen Ip on the occasion
of his 70th birthday and pay tribute to his scientific achievements. The
meeting will address a diverse range of subjects and objects in the Solar
system and beyond. It aims at bringing together senior and junior
scientists and students as well to encourage further collaborations as
demonstrated so well by Prof. Ip throughout his career.

Although the detailed schedule is under development, the scientific program
includes planets, comets, asteroids and other solar system objects, physics
of the heliosphere, exoplanets, astronomy of stars and galaxies, and
astrophysics in general. We solicit presentations on these and related
topics.

There will be a welcome party and a celebratory banquet, the detailed
schedule will be announced soon.

We plan to publish a proceeding of the symposium. Guidelines for submission
will be available in the second announcement.

The regular registration fee of the symposium is NTD 3500 (about USD110),
and the student registration fee is NTD 1500 (about USD 50). The fee
includes the banquet and coffee.
