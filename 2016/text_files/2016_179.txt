Topic:          How to make astrophysical jets?
Time:           11/16 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
I will present MHD simulations investigating the launching of
astrophysical jets.
First, a brief introduction into MHD wind and jets is given.

Our simulations treat the time-dependent evolution of the
accretion-ejection structure and the subsequent collimation of the disk
wind into a high-velocity jet.
The setup considers various models  for a  physical  (turbulent) magnetic
diffusivity that is essential for the mass loading of the outflow. We find
relatively high mass fluxes in the outflow, about 20-40% of the accretion
rate.

Recent simulations include a mean-field accretion disk dynamo and the
launching of outflows by a self-generated disk magnetic field.
We have run a parameter survey of disk-wind launched by disk of different
magnetization and find that the disk magnetization is the main parameter
that governs the jet dynamics.

Special relativistic jet formation simulations allow to construct
synchrotron radiation maps from the dynamical outflow structure that can
be compared to  the observations.
Finally I will present preliminary results from GR-MHD simulations
treating the accretion-ejection structure of outflows from resistive
accretion disks.
