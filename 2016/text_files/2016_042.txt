Dear all,

We would like to inform you that we are organizing the conference "Star Formation in Different Environments" in 25th to 29 July, 2016 and the registration and abstract submission is opened at
 http://sfde16.0x1115.org/
http://www.cita.utoronto.ca/~qnguyenl/SFDE_poster.pdf

Please help us us to inform your colleagues and we are looking forward to welcoming you to Vietnam this August.

On behalf of LOCs and SOCs,

Fumitaka Nakamura,
Quang Nguyen Luong?


Rationale:

The last few years have changed drastically the landscape of star formation research, thanks to the successful operations of Herschel Space Observatory, ALMA, JCMT, PdBI, IRAM 30m, SMA...and the new development in numerical simulations and theory. We aim at to bringing together theorists and observers working on star formation, who would address the most recent advances in our knowledge of filament, core, cloud evolution and their interconnection. The conference will target to all aspects of star formation, including low-mass star formation, massive star formation, filamentary structure, giant molecular clouds, and galaxy-scale star formation. The workshop also aims at fostering close collaboration via smaller size focus groups.

The meeting consists of several invited talks (25min including 5min for Q&A), contributed talk (15min including 5min for Q&A), and posters. Selection of contributed talks will be done by the SOC by the end of May 2016. There will be time for focus group meetings and a half-day excursion. For young astronomers from developing countries, there will be also two days star formation bootcamp prior to the conference which cover fundamental knowledge of star formation


Registration:

 http://sfde16.0x1115.org/
Early registration deadline: 31 March 2016
Oral abstract submission deadline: 31 March 2016
Final registration deadline: 03 July, 2016


Venue:

All sessions will be held in the ICISE conference center in Quy Nhon city, Vietnam. The ICISE will be constructed at Quy Nhon, a small town situated on the east coast of Vietnam, one hour north by air from Ho-Chi-Minh City (Saigon). It is an exceptional location near the sea, on an area of 20 hectares (50 acres), which has been offered by the provincial authorities to the ¨Rencontres du Vietnam〃 Association. The Center will consist of a Conference Building, with Auditoriums, seminar rooms, and offices for study and research. It will welcome national and international Conferences, specialized professional colloquia, as well as selected Thematic Schools, in particular for doctoral students.

In future stages, the Center should be complemented by several other elements :
 A planetarium will be constructed on high ground, and shall welcome groups of school children and university students, to inspire their interest in the marvelous enigmas of the Universe. An Exhibition Room and a Library with ?hands-on? demonstrations and apparatus (based on the methods of the ¨Main-a-la-Pate〃 and ¨Les petits debrouillards〃 projects in France) will complete this structure to give the general public a taste for learning throught research and the pleasure it gives.
 An Engineering School, providing Master-level professional instruction, will be set up, in collaboration with top international universities.
 A Hotel resort of international standard will be constructed next to ICISE along its maritime facade principally to welcome the Conference participants. While giving priority to the activities of the Center,according to the terms of their joint partnership, the resort will benefit from the rapid development of tourism in the region which will enhance the notoriety of the Center with a larger public.
