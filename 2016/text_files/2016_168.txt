---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Second Announcement of the ALMA Band 1 Science Workshop, ASIAA, Taipei
    (Taiwan), 16-18 January 2017
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The ALMA Band 1 Science Workshop will take place at the ASIAA (Academia
  Sinica, Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics) in Taipei (Taiwan) from
  January 16 to 18 2017. It will consist of a few invited talks on the main
  scientific goals of ALMA Band 1, plus contributed talks. We also plan
to have
  poster sessions. The ALMA Band 1 Science workshop will provide the first
  opportunity to show the exciting new science ALMA Band 1 can deliver
and to
  start preparing for the first observing proposals in the ALMA lowest
  frequency band.

  The two days after the workshop, 19-20 January, will be dedicated to the
  discussion and planning of the upcoming Band 1 Science Verification
  phase. These sessions are mainly addressed to the members of the
current SV
  team, but if you are interested in joining and/or in contributing to the
  Science Verification of Band 1, please write to the Project Scientist
of Band
  1, Oscar Morata (omorata@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw), so you can be added
  to the list.


IMPORTANT DEADLINES
-------------------

   - deadline for abstract submission: December 1st, 2016
   - deadline for hotel reservations: December 14th, 2016
   - deadline for registration: January 1st, 2017


SCIENTIFIC GOAL
---------------

  Several key science cases have been proposed to be studied with the Band 1
  Science Case aimed at greatly increasing the volume of the observable
  Universe and the range of observable frequencies and energies with
ALMA. The
  two main scientific goals of the ALMA Band 1 project are the study of the
  evolution of grains in protoplanetary disks, from mm to cm sizes, and the
  detection of molecular line emission from high-redshift galaxies, tracing
  molecular emission from redshifts z~1-10. Additionally, there is a broad
  range of science goals covered by ALMA Band 1: high-resolution and
  high-sensitivity observations of Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZE) in galaxy
  clusters; observations of very small grains and spinning dust; study
of the
  fine structure of chemical differentiation in cloud cores, tracing the
very
  cold phase of the ISM and probing the smallest length scales of chemical
  variation; complex carbon-chain molecules, including the aminoacids and
  sugars from which life on Earth may have originally evolved; the
opportunity
  to measure the initial mass-to-flux ratio of molecular cores through the
  detection of the Zeeman effect in spectral lines (CCS), ...
