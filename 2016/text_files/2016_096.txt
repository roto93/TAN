Dear ANASAC friends,

We are pleased to announce that Registration will open on 3 June (EDT) for the "Half a Decade of ALMA: Cosmic Dawns Transformed"
(http://go.nrao.edu/ALMA5years) conference which will be held 20 - 23 September 2016 at the Renaissance Indian Wells Resort in Indian
Wells, California, USA (near Palm Springs).

The sensitivity and spectral grasp of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) have revolutionized the study of the youngest structures in the Universe, from galaxy assembly through the formation of stars and planets. ALMA has produced over 400 refereed papers with over 4500 citations just beyond its four-year mark, reporting impressive and scientifically compelling results using the most sensitive and highest resolution mm/submm interferometer in the world.

One aim of the four day conference is to highlight recent ALMA results at the threshold of its fifth year of operation. Another goal is to bring together researchers from around the world to motivate collaborations for ALMA's Cycle 5. Science topics will include all fields of astronomy, from cosmology and galaxies in the distant universe, nearby galaxies and the Galactic Center, ISM and star formation in our own galaxy, astrochemistry, circumstellar disks, exoplanets, solar system, stellar evolution and the Sun. Please submit an abstract featuring your science soon, as the deadline for abstracts to be considered for verbal presentation is 24 June.

Early Registration will take place from 3 June - 1 August at a rate of $450 (Between 1 - 22 August, the registration fee increases to $650.)

Students can register at any time before 23 August for a reduced rate of $250.

Book your room at Indian Wells Resort at the time of registration to receive an instant $50 resort credit and become eligible for special
room upgrades.  Winners will be chosen at random and if you book before 1 July, you will double your chances to win.

Students are automatically eligible, with the submission of an abstract, to receive half the advertised room rate (a value of ~$400
USD).

Please visit the conference website (http://go.nrao.edu/ALMA5years) for updates, timeline of events (e.g. abstract submission deadline,
registration closing) and future announcements, and contact the Local Organizing Committee at ALMA5yrs@nrao.edu with any questions
including the opportunity for travel support (requests due on 1 July, 2016!).

Anthony Remijan, on behalf of the Scientific Organizing Committee

Dear all,

This is a reminder.
Please register the summer school as soon as possible, if you or your students/postdocs are considering to attend.
The registration is almost full. There are only less than 10 seats left.
We might close the registration much earlier than the original deadline.

Thanks for your attention.

Tangtang.

*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________
Speaker:        Woong Tae Kim (SNU)
Topic:          Star Formation in Nuclear Rings of Barred-Spiral Galaxies
Time:           6/15 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Barred-spiral galaxies contain star-forming nuclear rings at their centers. Star formation rates (SFRs) in the rings vary widely in the range of 0.1-10 M��yr��. Ring star formation appears long lived, lasting over a few Gyrs. Some rings show a well-defined azimuthal age gradient of star clusters along a ring, while others do not. To study what controls star formation in the rings, we use numerical simulations by including a prescription for star formation and feedback effects. In models without spiral arms, SFR in a ring exhibits a strong burst at early time and declines to small values at late time. On the other hand, models with spiral arms outside the bar region show multiple starburst activities at late time caused by arm-induced gas inflows. In all models, young star clusters in rings show an azimuthal age gradient only when the SFR is small. A linear stability analysis shows that rings with no age gradient appear gravitationally unstable, consistent with observatio!
 ns. I will also report our recent efforts on star formation in three-dimensional rings and their impact on hot halo gas.

Title:Two-Component Advective Flow Solution :
A Generalized Model to Understand Accretion
Flow Dynamics Around Black Holes

Abstract:
It has been more than two decades of the classic work by Chakrabarti and
his collaborators on
the two component advective flow (TCAF) model. Recently, we
successfully been able to include it in HEASARC's spectral analysis
software package XSPEC as an additive local model to fit energy
spectra from different black hole candidates (BHCs) and obtain
physical accretion flow parameters, such as, two component
(Keplerian disk and sub-Keplerian halo) accretion rates, shock
(location, i.e., the size of the Compton cloud, and the compression
ratio) parameters. Evolutions of spectral and timing properties are
transparent from the TCAF model fitted/derived physical
parameters. Reason of different spectral states and their transitions
during an outburst of a transient BHC are also clear. One can also
predict frequency of the dominating quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO)
from TCAF model fitted shock parameters and even predict most
preferable mass range of an unknown BHC from TCAF fits. To our
knowledge this gives us the most physical tool to investigate the
accretion flow dynamics around black hole candidates.
