*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________
Speaker:        Shigehisa Takakuwa (ASIAA)
Topic:          SMA and ALMA Study of Protostellar Binaries
Time:           2/17 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
In this colloquium I will talk about our SMA / ALMA observations of protostellar
binaries L1551 IRS 5, L1551 NE, and XZ Tau, including our latest ALMA cycle 2 results of L1551 NE. We found that the structures of the disks surrounding the binaries, circumbinary disks, are different among these protostellar binaries in the L1551 region. While in L1551 NE the circumbinary disk consists of two spiral arms stemming from the individual stars, in L1551 IRS 5 such arm features are not seen, and in XZ Tau no circumbinary disk is present. In L1551 IRS 5 and NE the gas motions in the circumbinary disks exhibit Keplerian rotation, but in the innermost part of the circumbinary disk in L1551 NE infalling motion toward the protostellar binary is also seen. I will discuss these results in the context of mass accretion onto the protostellar binaries and physical mechanism to set the final binary mass and mass ratio.
