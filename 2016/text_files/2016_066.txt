Dear Colleague,

We are please to announce the workshop "SMA Science in the Next Decade”
that will be held in ASIAA (academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy & Astrophysics),
Taipei, Taiwan in the coming fall.

Best regards,

Naomi Hirano (ASIAA)
 on behalf of the SOC/LOC

--------------------

The Submillimeter Array (SMA) has provided forefront capabilities for high spatial
and spectral resolution observations at submillimeter wavelengths from its
excellent site on Mauna Kea, Hawaii since 2004. SMA observations have
resulted in new insights into a wide variety of astrophysical phenomena, from
protoplanetary disks to high redshift galaxies. The much larger international Atacama
Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) is now in routine operation at millimeter
and submillimeter wavelengths. To maintain a leading role in the ALMA era, the SMA
project has embarked on an ambitious, staged, strategic upgrade to dramatically
improve its sensitivity and observing speed. The new wideband SMA -- the wSMA —
will be ideally suited to spectral line surveys and studies of submillimeter sources in
the time domain, as well as a wealth of other applications. This workshop will provide
a forum for astronomers from the SMA collaboration and user community to promote,
discuss, and elaborate key science cases for wSMA observations in the next decade.
The workshop will also facilitate the forging of collaborations to help realize these new
science opportunities.

The wSMA will impact a wide range of topics, including:
        ▪       High-Z Galaxies
        ▪       Nearby Galaxies
        ▪       Galactic Center
        ▪       Star Formation
        ▪       Circumstellar Disks
        ▪       Evolved Stars
        ▪       Solar System Objects
        ▪       Astrochemistry
        ▪       Time-Domain Astronomy
        ▪       EHT/VLBI
        ▪       Instrumentation

Venue
Room 1203, AS/NTU Astronomy-Mathematics Building,
No.1, Roosevelt Rd, Sec. 4, (inside NTU main campus)
Taipei, Taiwan
