Dear Yi-Jehng: 

  Could you please to announce this in TAN? 

    Subaru Winter School in NCU 

    Please notice that we will have a Subaru Winter School in NCU on 
Dec 7-9. The workshop is to encourage the usage of Subaru telescope by 
providing the lectures for the data reduction of Subaru data. This 
time three instruments are picked (HSC, MOIRCS, HDS). The targeted 
participants are students, postdocs and junior faculty. The number of 
participants are limited to 20 so if you are interested, please check 
out the website 
http://events.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/school/20161207/index.php 
  The application deadline is Oct 24. Thank you. 

best 
Shiang-Yu

Topic:         Constraints on Neutrino Masses from the Lensing Dispersion of Type Ia Supernovae
Time:         10/18 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
We investigate how accurately the total mass of neutrinos is constrained from the magnitude dispersion of Type Ia supernovae due to the effects of gravitational lensing. For this purpose, we use the propagation equation of light bundles in a realistic inhomogeneous universe and propose a sample selection for supernovae to avoid difficulties associated with small scale effects such as strong lensing or shear effects. With a fitting formula for the non-linear matter power spectrum taking account of the effects of massive neutrino, we find 峉m彖 < 1.1 eV (95% CL) for future optical imaging surveys: WFIRST and LSST. Furthermore, we show that it is possible to realize the current tightest limit 峉m彖 < 0.2 eV from deeper surveys, z > 2.5, if we are able to reduce the magnitude error except for lensing to about half of the present value.

Title: On the morphological correspondence among
        magnetic fields,filaments, bipolar bubbles in RCW57A

Abstract:

The influence of magnetic fields (B-fields) in the formation
and evolution of bipolar bubbles due to the expanding ionization
fronts driven by the HII regions that are formed and embedded in
filamentary molecular clouds has not been well-studied yet.
In addition to the anistropic expansion of ionization fronts in a 
filament, B-fields are expected to introduce an additional anisotropic
pressure in favor of expansion and propagation of ionization fronts to
form a bipolar bubble.

I will present the results based on near-infrared polarimetric 
observations towards the central area of the star-forming region RCW57A
hosting an HII region, a filament and a bipolar bubble. Polarization
measurements of reddened background stars in the JHKs-bands reveal that
B-fields, that are threaded perpendicular to the filament long axis, are
configured into an hour-glass morphology thereby closely following the
structure of the bipolar bubble which manifests one-to-one correspondence
between them.

B-field pressure is found to be dominated over thermal, turbulent and
radiative pressures in the region, thereby reinforcing the fact that
B-fields indeed playing an influenceable role. Based on the observed
morphological correlations among the the B-fields, filament and bipolar 
bubble, we believe that the B-fields are important not only in cloud 
contraction to form a filament, gravitational collapse and star formation
in it, but also in the formation and evolution of bipolar bubble in
RCW57A.

I also present few slides on my involvement on other projects related
to optical/NIR/sub-mm polarimetry.

Tea/Discussion Time is followed !  All Welcome !!

1st Announcement of EA ALMA Science Workshop 2016-Taiwan

In the past few cycles of ALMA scientific operations, we see great success
from the EA community in producing remarkable results. We are also excited
by the expansion of the ALMA community into Korea. To maintain the momentum
and to promote regional collaboration, we hold regular science workshops in
the three EA-ALMA countries.

We are pleased to announce the 2016 East-Asian ALMA Science Workshop, to be
held by National Tsing Hua University in Hsinchu, Taiwan, on March 10-12,
2017.  Like the previous EA-ALMA Science Workshops, we invite ALMA users to
present their recent results.  Furthermore, we would like to enhance the
workshop functions on promoting discussion and regional collaborations, by
adjusting the workshop format.  We will split part of the workshop into two
parallel sessions on Galactic and extragalactic studies. We will have
special sessions for prospective projects to call for collaborators, for
archival science, and science that require multi-wavelength observations.
The workshop will be timely to develop proposal ideas and form
collaborations for the upcoming Cycle-5 deadline for PI programs.  On the
other hand, we encourage teams that plan to submit large proposals to hold
meetings in advance, and present their ideas in the EA ALMA Science
Workshop.

More specifically, we warmly welcome the following kinds of presentations:
1. new ALMA science results, based on either PI data or archive data.
2. future/ongoing science studies that may benefit from ALMA's new
capabilities (VLBI, polarization, solar)
3. future/ongoing scicece studies that require synergies with other major
observatories
4. cycle-5 proposal ideas that welcome collaborations
5. proposal ideas from non-radio-experts seeking for collaborations and/or
feedback

More details about the workshop can be found on our website:
http://events.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/workshop/20170310
Please mark your calendar and prepare your trip to Taiwan.
