Topic:          Spatial distribution of steep lunar craters may be linked to size-dependent orbital distribution of impactors
Time:           7/26 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1107
Abstract:
The depth/diameter (d/D) ratio of simple lunar craters (D<15km) is known to be ~0.2 at the time of formation; larger complex craters (D>15km) have smaller d/D ratios. We examine the spatial distribution of high d/D ratio (>0.18) craters using LU60645GT catalogue (SalamuniÄ‡car et al. 2012). We select craters larger than 8km for which the census is known to be almost complete over the whole lunar surface. We find that the number density of steep craters in maria is significantly lower than in highlands, which may be explained by the age differences of the background surfaces. We also find that the spatial density of steep craters in the equatorial region is lower than in the polar region. On the contrary, higher cratering flux on the lunar equator has been claimed: from the numerical calculations with the orbital distribution of observed Earth Crossing Objects (ECOs) larger than 1km (Le Feuvre & Wieczorek 2008; Ito & Malhotra 2010) and from the distribution of steepest slopes!
  at a 25m baseline (Kreslavsky & Head, 2016). In order to reconcile our findings with previous observations, we hypothesize that the cratering rate at low latitudes has been higher for meter to decameter size ECOs than for kilometer size objects since the Late Imbrian epoch; smaller objects have triggered more frequent mass wasting on the pre-existing large steep craters (D>8km, d/D>0.18) at low latitudes, thereby reducing the surviving number of steep craters. Our hypothesis is supported by the finding that the power-law slope in the H magnitude distribution for the low inclination ECOs (i<15 deg) is steeper than for the high inclination objects.
