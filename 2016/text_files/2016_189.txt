Title: Planet formation in AB Auriga:
        imaging inner gaseous spirals inside the dust cavity


Abstract:
Studies of planet forming disks have rapidly advanced in
the last few years thanks to high contrast high angular
resolution images obtained in the optical/near infrared
and in the mm/submm regime. In the meantime, several
exoplanets have been found by direct imaging in nearby
debris disks. Studying planet formation in younger systems
where the molecular gas and dust material are not yet fully
dissipated is a clue to understand how a planetary system
forms and evolves while the disk dissipates.

In order to trace the structures induced by embedded objects,
such as companion or planets, I observed the 12CO 2-1 transition
at 0.1 angular resolution in the AB Aurigae system using ALMA.
The 12CO 2-1 gas exhibits two spiral-like features within 0.7"
(radius, r, 90AU) away from the star. These spirals are trailing
and non-self-gravitating. Two possible locations of the embedded
objects are suggested in order to explain the observed features
in AB Aurigae system.

Tea/Discussion Time is followed !  All Welcome !
