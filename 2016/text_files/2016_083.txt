____________________________________________________
Speaker:        Teppei Okumura (Kavli IPMU/University of Tokyo)
Topic:          Probing cosmic acceleration with large-scale structure of the Universe
Time:           5/16 (Monday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Revealing the acceleration of the cosmic expansion is one of the most important issues not only in cosmology but in fundamental physics. The mysterious dark energy could be driving the acceleration, or gravity law predicted from Einstein’s theory of general relativity could be breaking down at cosmological scales. To investigate the origin of the acceleration, one needs to probe both geometry (expansion history of the Universe) and gravity (structure growth history of the Universe). Thus, observations of large-scale structure of the Universe traced by galaxy surveys are considered as the best probe for this purpose, because the expansion history is probed by a measurement of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) and the growth history is probed using redshift-space distortions and weak lensing. In this talk, I will present the constraints on dark energy and gravity theory I obtained using current galaxy surveys. Then I will demonstrate that the accuracy of the current theoret!
 ical models for extracting the dark energy or gravity properties is not high enough for the future precision surveys such as the Subaru SuMIRe project (Hyper Suprime Cam / Prime Focus Spectrograph). Particularly, incorrect modeling of redshift-space distortions easily leads to a wrong constraint on gravity theories. In the latter part of my talk, I will present a new theoretical model of redshift-space distortions I have been developing, which achieves a percent level accuracy for galaxy power spectrum up to very small scales. Finally, I will mention how theoretical study of large-scale structure is related to other fields, such as galaxy formation, physics of galaxy clusters, etc.

Speaker:        Jun Yi Kevin Koay (University of Copenhagen)
Topic:          The curious case of the changing-look Seyfert galaxy Mrk 590
Time:           5/19 (Thursday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Sometime between the years 2006 and 2012, the broad Hbeta emission line
of Mrk 590, once classified as a Seyfert 1 galaxy, completely
disappeared! The optical-UV continuum emission has faded to the point
where it can be fully accounted for by the host galaxy starlight. As
such, Mrk 590 would now be classified as a Seyfert 1.9 or 2 galaxy,
which goes against the prevailing scheme of AGN unification where the
presence of broad emission lines depends only on source orientation.
Similar decreases in the radio and X-ray continuum fluxes suggest that
the central engine of Mrk 590 may be turning off or transitioning into a
radiatively inefficient mode of accretion. I will talk about the origin
of the compact, unresolved radio emission in Mrk 590 and the physical
nature of its variability in relation to the variability observed at
other wavelengths. I will also present recent CO line observations with
ALMA, which provide the strongest limits to date on the molecular gas
mass in the central regions, to determine if this AGN is indeed running
out of gas to fuel it.

Speaker:        Andrew Cooper (Univ. Durham)
Topic:          The Cosmological Context of Galactic Stellar Halos and Satellites
Time:           5/19 (Thursday) 11:00 - 12:00
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
The outskirts of massive galaxies are host to a rich variety of
enigmatic phenomena, including diffuse stellar halos, tidal streams,
dwarf satellites and globular clusters. The huge spatial extent and
intrinsic faintness of such systems has so far limited our
observational knowledge to the mere tip of this proverbial iceberg.
Pioneering techniques with existing instruments are rapidly revising
the status quo, and an even more dramatic revolution is due in the
next decade as a deluge of data arrives from ultra-deep photometric
surveys with HSC and LSST, Gaia’s survey of the Milky Way, and
massively-multiplexed spectroscopy in the nearby Universe with DESI,
4MOST, WEAVE and PFS. These new surveys present exciting challenges in
the synthesis of information from a wide range of methods, sources and
scales, from the most massive galaxy clusters to the Milky Way and the
earliest epoch of galaxy formation. In this talk, I will describe my
work with cosmological simulations aimed at addressing those
challenges and understanding what we can learn from such observations.
In particular, I will discuss pressing issues in the ‘big picture’ of
Lambda-CDM galaxy formation that could be tackled by testing
predictions of a surprisingly intimate relationship between the
properties of stellar halos, satellites and dark matter halos.
