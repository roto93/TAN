 Dear ALMA Taiwan people,

 Proposal call for the GMVA with the phased ALMA is issued.
Note the deadline is very soon, Feb. 1. Please see below
and the links for details. In the EA region, Nagai-san
(hiroshi,nagai at nao.ac.jp) can answer your inquiries on this.

 Sincerely,
 Shigehisa Takakuwa, on behalf of ALMA Taiwan

Participation of ALMA in GMVA observations in ALMA Cycle 4=20

It is expected that phased ALMA will participate in some GMVA =
observations during=20
ALMA Cycle 4 at 3mm wavelengths (Oct 1 2016 - Sept 30 2017; see the ALMA
Cycle 4 Pre-announcement
(https://almascience.nao.ac.jp/news/alma-cycle-4-pre-announcement)). The
number of ALMA dishes in the phased array is likely to be 30 - 40. ALMA
will not be in a configuration suitable for VLBI during GMVA Session II
2016. GMVA session dates during Cycle 4 are not yet fixed but Session I
in 2017, which is likely to be in March or April, should provide an
opportunity for GMVA + ALMA observing. (GMVA Session II in 2017 is
unlikely to overlap in Cycle 4 with ALMA in a configuration suitable for
VLBI.)

Any GMVA proposal requesting phased ALMA during Cycle 4 must be =
submitted via=20
the NRAO Proposal Submission Tool (PST) at the February 1, 2016 deadline
at NRAO Interactive Services. Use of the PST requires registration in
the NRAO User Database.
