Speaker:        Howard K.C. Yee (Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics, University of Toronto)
Topic:          The Evolution of Galaxies in Clusters at z~1 and Beyond
Time:           3/1 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           Physics 104
Abstract:
Galaxy clusters provide a large range of environments for the study of
how the environment affects galaxy evolution. I will present some recent
results on the evolution of galaxies in clusters at z~1 and beyond from
two large cluster surveys.  SpARCS is an imaging survey designed to search
for galaxy clusters up to z~2 using the cluster red-sequence technique
based on a combination of Spitzer Space Telescope’s IRAC 3.6um and
ground-based z’-band images; GLASS is a multi-object spectroscopic survey
of 10 of the richest SpARCS clusters at z~1 using the Gemini 8.2m
telescopes. Analysis of GCLASS data show that galaxies in-falling into
clusters at z~1 have their star formation suppressed in a relatively short
time scale of less than 0.5 Gyr at an average location close to 0.5 r_200
(the cluster-centric radius within which the cluster is largely virialized).
From imaging data obtain using the 24um MIPS camera on Spitzer, we also
find that lower-mass in-falling galaxies show a possible last-gasp increase
in their star formation before become quiescent. Using far-IR/submm data
from the Herschel Space telescope, we will take a detailed look at the
change in star formation via dust emission in 3 clusters at z~1.2 as
galaxies in-fall into the clusters.

Massive stars formed in atomic hydrogen reservoirs"
Abstract:
I will discuss the process of gas inflow on galaxies and subsequent
fueling of star-formation. Using recent ATCA HI observations I will
show that galaxies showing anomalous local metallicity decrements
(gamma-ray burst host galaxies) have substantial atomic gas
reservoirs, and are deficient in molecular gas. This suggest that star
formation in these galaxies may be fuelled by recent inflow of
metal-poor atomic gas. This is controversial, but can happen in
low-metallicity gas near the onset of star formation because cooling
of gas (necessary for star formation) is faster than the HI-to-H2
conversion.

Title:
Photometric redshifts for X-ray selected AGNs: paving the way towards the
study of AGN/galaxy coevolution

Abstract:

To better investigate the AGN and galaxies coevolution, we need to have a
complete characterisation and census of AGNs with accurate redshifts.
Spectroscopic redshifts are relatively reliable, however, it is
time-consuming and difficult to be obtained for faint sources at high
redshifts. Therefore we have to rely on photometric redshifts (photo-z)
which need to be tuned specifically for AGNs. In our work, we studied on
the X-ray selected AGNs in the Chandra deep filed-south (CDFS) region,
mainly using de-blending Subaru intermediate bands and HST
optical/near-infrared data to compute photo-z. We first matched the
multi-wavelength counterparts for the X-ray sources, then applied proper
magnitude priors and appropriate AGN-galaxy hybrid templates for SED
fitting. We achieved a photo-z accuracy of 0.013 with an outliers fraction
of 5.3% for X-ray sources. With the SED fitting results of our well-trained
AGN-galaxy hybrids, we further studied the AGN host properties via the
rest-frame color-magnitude diagram (CMD) which is an useful probe to trace
the stellar populations. We made corrections for dust extinction and AGN
contamination for the AGN host colors, and found that the AGN host colors
also present a bimodality in the CMD up to z~2.5 as found in normal
galaxies. In this talk, I will present the CMD result of AGN host colors,
and compare with the result of normal galaxies.
