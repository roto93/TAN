Dear all:

Below please find the announcement of UCAT Summer Student Program
(USSP2016).  Please feel free to circulate this message.

I encourage all the members to take advantage of this summer student
program for recruitment of young scientists.  We still accept projects
if you have not yet done so.

Yi-Jehng: Please help to post this on TAN.  Thank you.

Regards,
Vivien

The Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA;
http://www.almaobservatory.org) is the largest ground based
astronomical project in existence.  Built by an worldwide partnership,
this new generation telescope offers the best opportunities to unveil
the origin of our universe as well as the origin of life.

The University Consortium of ALMA–Taiwan (UCAT;
http://alma.astr.nthu.edu.tw) is embarking upon this unprecedented
project and is inviting students to apply to the UCAT Summer Student
Program (http://alma.astr.nthu.edu.tw/tucasa/USSP2016.html), where
they will have the opportunity to lead unique groundbreaking research
under the guidance of astronomers and prepare for the use of this
experiment.  Opportunity is open to about 8-10 students with
preference given to the junior level or higher, whose majors are in
any scientific disciplines (physics, mathematics, chemistry, computer
science, engineering, and of course astronomy).

Students will attend a series of lecture designed for them in the
Summer School, to introduce ALMA, radio astronomy, and a broad range
of research subjects.  Also, all students are required to give an oral
report of their research projects at the conclusion of the program,
and to provide a written report suitable for public reviewing.

Successful applicants will work at UCAT member universities from 2015
July 01 (Fri) to August 31 (Wed) at a monthly stipend of NT $20,000.
A brief description of the research projects offered can be found
below.

To apply, please fill out and email the registration form to Mr.
Chih-Chun Hsu (許智鈞; cc-hsu@mx.nthu.edu.tw)  by April 20 (Wed).
Applicants must indicate on their application form the project or
projects of their most interests and provide letters of recommendation
(up to two).  Offers will be announced on May 05 (Thu).

Title: Diffuse Lyman-alpha halos around star forming galaxies ~ as a tracer
of galaxy evolution

Abstract:

Theoretical studies have suggested that Lyman-alpha emission of high-z
star-forming galaxies extends than their UV continuum emission which
reflects star-forming regions in galaxies (e.g., Laursen &
Sommer-Larsen 2007, Zheng et al. 2011, Dijkstra & Kramer 2012,
Verhamme et al. 2012). This extended Lyman-alpha emission feature
around galaxies is so called Lyman-alpha halos (LAHs). Because LAHs
are too diffuse to detect from a single galaxy, the stacking analysis
is often used to find the evidence of LAHs from observational data
(e.g., Steidel et al. 2011, Matsuda et al. 2012). However, there is a
argument that artifacts by the analysis are possible to produce
artificial LAHs. Thus, the existence of LAHs is still under debate. In
order to investigate the presence of LAHs, we use large star-forming
galaxy samples at z = 2-7 found by Subaru telescope, and also
carefully examine potential artifacts mimicking LAHs. In this talk, we
show our analysis and results of LAHs over wide redshift range.
Additionally, we also discuss the dependences between physical
properties of LAEs and the sizes of LAHs based on my recent paper
(Momose et al. 2016).
