Dear all,

Here I send you the Call for Abstracts of the North American
ALMA Science Center (NAASC) Workshop on "Molecular Gas in
Galactic Environments."  If you are studying molecular gas
in nearby galaxies, please consider presenting your results.

Support for students are particularly good, so if students
have good results (and supervisors have enough budget to
support), please consider sending students, too.

Cheers,
Satoki
on behalf of SOC

NAASC Workshop on Molecular Gas in Galactic Environments


--- Call for Abstracts ---

We are delighted to announce a Call for Abstracts for the 2016 NAASC
Workshop on Molecular Gas in Galactic Environments to be held April 4 –
7, 2016, in Charlottesville, VA.

https://science.nrao.edu/science/meetings/2016/molecular-gas-in-galactic-environments/home

ALMA’s line sensitivity and spectral grasp has resulted in the
identification and imaging of more than forty molecules outside the
Milky Way.  The workshop focuses on the character of the molecular gas
in the varied environments in which these molecules are found beyond our
Galaxy.  This international conference will bring together ALMA, VLA and
GBT users and potential users of other upcoming facilities, such as
ngVLA, JWST, and TMT to consider what capabilities or upgrades to these
instruments might facilitate the study of extragalactic molecules most.

Major Topics of Discussion Include:

•Exploring the relationship between molecular distributions and physical
processes in those galaxies
•Investigating the roles of molecular variation in extreme metallicity
environments
•Examining the existence and cause of isotopic gradients within galaxies
•Scrutinizing variations in molecular excitation, both rotational and
vibrational
•Seeking evidence for and causes of molecular abundance gradients
•Identifying molecules useful as probes of nuclear infall and outflow
•Determining the prospects of molecules as probes of black hole masses.

Confirmed Invited Speakers:

•       Francesco Costagliola
•       Nanase Harada
•       Christian Henkel
•       Leslie Hunt
•       Takuma Izumi
•       Adam Leroy
•       Sergio Martin
•       Gergö Popping
•       Dominik Riechers
•       Nick Scoville
•       Jean Turner

This 4-day NAASC workshop will consist of a number of invited talks to
guide the discussions of relevant questions to be addressed. Contributed
abstracts will be solicited, and the SOC will select a subset for oral
presentations, with the rest accepted as posters. Registration will
include workshop materials, daily breakfast, breaks, and a welcome
reception. An optional conference dinner will also be available.
Submissions by students and early-career researchers are especially
encouraged.

To promote their attendance, students are offered a discounted
registration rate and a free double-occupancy room in the conference
hotel for the duration of the conference.

Abstract submission is now available via the conference website – the
deadline is February 7th.  Registration will open the week of January
11, and Early Bird registration rates will be available until the
abstract deadline

We look forward to seeing everyone in Charlottesville in April!

*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________
Speaker:        Jean Coupon (University of Geneva)
Topic:          Probing the relationship between Galaxies and Dark Matter with Lensing and Clustering in CFHTLenS/VIPERS
Time:           1/20 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
I will present recent results on the connection between galaxies and dark matter haloes up to z=1, measured from a combined lensing and clustering analysis in the CFHTLS/VIPERS field. We obtained 30 deg2 of deep NIR data over the entire VIPERS area: whereas this program was initially designed to get robust stellar masses for the spectroscopic targets, we have shown that when properly calibrating photo-z's with spectro-z's and accounting for photo-z error in the modelling, one is able to get accurate constraints from projected clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing from a photometric sample. This significant increase in survey area for such depths and good lensing data allowed us to consistently probe the Mstar-Mh relation from the peak of the stellar-to-halo mass ratio (SHMR) up to the most massive clusters, a key asset to bring new insights on galaxy evolution.

 Dear ALMA Taiwan people,

 Proposal call for the GMVA with the phased ALMA is issued.
Note the deadline is very soon, Feb. 1. Please see below
and the links for details. In the EA region, Nagai-san
(hiroshi,nagai at nao.ac.jp) can answer your inquiries on this.

 Sincerely,
 Shigehisa Takakuwa, on behalf of ALMA Taiwan

Participation of ALMA in GMVA observations in ALMA Cycle 4=20

It is expected that phased ALMA will participate in some GMVA =
observations during=20
ALMA Cycle 4 at 3mm wavelengths (Oct 1 2016 - Sept 30 2017; see the ALMA
Cycle 4 Pre-announcement
(https://almascience.nao.ac.jp/news/alma-cycle-4-pre-announcement)). The
number of ALMA dishes in the phased array is likely to be 30 - 40. ALMA
will not be in a configuration suitable for VLBI during GMVA Session II
2016. GMVA session dates during Cycle 4 are not yet fixed but Session I
in 2017, which is likely to be in March or April, should provide an
opportunity for GMVA + ALMA observing. (GMVA Session II in 2017 is
unlikely to overlap in Cycle 4 with ALMA in a configuration suitable for
VLBI.)

Any GMVA proposal requesting phased ALMA during Cycle 4 must be =
submitted via=20
the NRAO Proposal Submission Tool (PST) at the February 1, 2016 deadline
at NRAO Interactive Services. Use of the PST requires registration in
the NRAO User Database.

For details, please see the link at the top.
