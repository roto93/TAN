*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________
Speaker:        Hsi-An Pan (ASIAA)
Topic:          Environmental Dependence of GMCs: simulation and observation
Time:           8/3 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
A long-standing question about star formation is whether it is sensitive to large-scale galaxy structures. Observations show that strong bars (high ellipticity and long length) typically contain less or no star formation, while weak bars (low ellipticity and short) have more. This suggests that large-scale structure can indeed influence star formation. Yet galactic bar is a poorly-explored region, its actual effect on star formation is not yet clear.

If star formation does care about galaxy structures, this should be reflected in the properties of giant molecular clouds (GMCs), because their conditions determine whether a star can form. In this research,  we study the impact of bar on the properties of simulated GMCs formed in a set of galaxies for which their bar strength differs in a quantitatively controlled way.
We also discuss the possibility to observe the environmental dependence of GMCs by considering the observational bias.
