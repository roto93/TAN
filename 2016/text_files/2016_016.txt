Dear CFHT users

1) The deadline for the submission of CFHT Large Programs has been
extended to February 29 2016.

2) New information has been added to the CFHT MegaCam and WIRCam
webpages. Please see:

http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/Instruments/Imaging/Megacam/specsinformation.html
for an update on the new broad band filters and their calibration
against the SNLS deep field catalogs. The page will eventually include
specific calibration info on the narrow band filters as soon as
the observations become available in those bands.

http://cfht.hawaii.edu/Instruments/Imaging/WIRCam/dietWIRCam.html for
the revised photometric calibration of WIRCam and
http://cfht.hawaii.edu/Instruments/Imaging/WIRCam/IiwiVersion2Doc.html
for information on the new non-linearity correction.

Dr. Daniel Devost
Director of Science Operations/Directeur des Operations Scientifiques
