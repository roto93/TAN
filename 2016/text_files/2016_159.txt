*** Special Seminar ***
____________________________________________________
Speaker:        Sergio Martin (ALMA)
Topic:          Astrochemistry in opaqueness Compact Obscured Nuclei: Arp 220
Time:           10/24 (Monday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Probing the inners regions behind the optically thick dust layer of heavily obscured LIRGs and ULIRGs are a major observational challenge. The obscuration of Av>1000 mag prevent the
direct observation at all wavelenghts. Understanding the nuclear engines of these galaxies may be key for a complete AGN and starburst census as well as understanding nuclear growth and feedback mechanisms. Molecular observations have been usually exploited as a way to circunvent
obscuration, however molecular diagnostics are still debated in "unobscured" galaxies, let alone towards this objects. The prototypical ULIRG Arp 220, usual suspect and closest example of
ULIRG CON, has been the target of multiple ALMA observations showing that obscuration and absorption (both self-absorption and continuum absorption) may actually be preventing direct observation of the nuclear few tenths of parsercs even with high density molecular probes. Molecular transitions in particular excitation conditions might be the answer to peer into these objects. That is the case of the vibrationally excited transitions of dense molecular tracers such as HCN and HC3N. Here i will summarize the latest observational results towards Arp 220 which illustrates the observational difficulties inherent to such obscured nuclei. I will also present the recent results on vibrationally excited emission in (U)LIRGs which have gain relevance during the last few years.

Speaker:        Min S. Yun (University of Massachusetts)
Topic:          The Large Millimeter Telescope (LMT) and the Most Luminous Infrared Galaxies in the Universe
Time:           10/25 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
The Large Millimeter Telescope (LMT) is now in the final phase of completing the full 50-m aperture with fully operating active surface system, but it has been conducting a productive Early Science campaign since 2013 by illuminating the inner 32-m diameter using first light instruments 1.1mm bolometer camera AzTEC and the Redshift Search Receiver (RSR).  In this talk, I will present some of the highlights of the ES scientific results, including my own research on the most luminous IR galaxies in the Universe through the LMT follow-up of the candidate sources we identified from the Planck database.  I will also briefly discuss the next generation LMT instruments currently in construction and their key science programs.



*** Colloquium ***

Speaker:        Scott Chapman (Dalhousie University)
Topic:          Gas, Dust, and Quenching in Dusty Star-Forming Galaxies in the Early Universe
Time:           10/26 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
The most intense star formation in the universe takes place in dusty, star-forming galaxies at high redshift. Recent observations and circumstantial evidence suggest that these galaxies are the likely progenitors of the earliest generation of massive, quiescent galaxies. I will discuss recent efforts to detect and resolve the gas and dust on sub-kiloparsec scales using observations of gravitationally lensed dusty galaxies discovered by the South Pole Telescope conducted by ALMA and other facilities. These observations demonstrate the richness of the molecular ISM, shed light on the relative distribution of star formation and the gas from which stars form, and offer a unique window into the evolution of dusty galaxies impossible to obtain without the aid of gravitational lensing. Finally, I will present new ALMA observations which show signs of feedback on the molecular ISM in dusty star-forming galaxies, providing tantalizing evidence of an evolutionary connection between hi!
 gh-redshift dusty galaxies and the first massive, quiescent systems.
