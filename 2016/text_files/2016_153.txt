Hi,
Kindly remind you that only one talk today
(2nd one is cancelled due to flight/typhoon)
The speaker will be here at 3 p.m., I will take him around
you all ! Just open your office door if you are free.

> Title: Type Ia supernovae and their host galaxies
>
> Abstract:
> Type Ia Supernovae are exceptionally bright explosions, and their
> calibrateable brightness make them useful tools in probing the cosmic
> expansion. However, the progenitors of SNe Ia are still unclear, which
> could introduce uncertainties in their use in cosmology. Previous studies
> have shown that the host environment is an important variable in controlling
> SN Ia luminosities, even after the standard light curve
> shape corrections have been performed. In this work, we investigate the
> relation between SNe Ia and their host galaxies using high quality
> photometric and spectroscopic data. We present the results obtained by
> comparing the SN and host properties and analyze the dependence of SNe Ia on
> their host environments.

> Title: Feedback driven Galactic star forming regions:
>        Stellar census and characteristics
>
> Abstract:
> The role of feedback from massive stars has been long discussed as a
> dynamical trigger for subsequent star formation.  Simulations show that the
> effect of stellar feedback depends upon factors such as the input radiation,
> wind energy, local ISM conditions etc. As a result, the feedback effect on
> star formation activity may vary from region to region. In this context, star
> formation activity within a few, massive star forming regions have been
> performed. Systematic analysis of the stellar census and gas density are used
> to estimate the star formation efficiency, star formation rate and initial
> mass function. We explore how the star formation properties at different
> parts of individual regions vary with respect to the dense gas fraction as
> well as the amount of input energy from massive stars. Our analysis suggests
> that the stellar feedback from massive stars  influence only to its localized
> neighborhood and may not have much impact on the global star formation
> activities of the regions.
