Title: On the morphological correspondence among
        magnetic fields,filaments, bipolar bubbles in RCW57A

Abstract:

The influence of magnetic fields (B-fields) in the formation
and evolution of bipolar bubbles due to the expanding ionization
fronts driven by the HII regions that are formed and embedded in
filamentary molecular clouds has not been well-studied yet.
In addition to the anistropic expansion of ionization fronts in a 
filament, B-fields are expected to introduce an additional anisotropic
pressure in favor of expansion and propagation of ionization fronts to
form a bipolar bubble.

I will present the results based on near-infrared polarimetric 
observations towards the central area of the star-forming region RCW57A
hosting an HII region, a filament and a bipolar bubble. Polarization
measurements of reddened background stars in the JHKs-bands reveal that
B-fields, that are threaded perpendicular to the filament long axis, are
configured into an hour-glass morphology thereby closely following the
structure of the bipolar bubble which manifests one-to-one correspondence
between them.

B-field pressure is found to be dominated over thermal, turbulent and
radiative pressures in the region, thereby reinforcing the fact that
B-fields indeed playing an influenceable role. Based on the observed
morphological correlations among the the B-fields, filament and bipolar 
bubble, we believe that the B-fields are important not only in cloud 
contraction to form a filament, gravitational collapse and star formation
in it, but also in the formation and evolution of bipolar bubble in
RCW57A.

I also present few slides on my involvement on other projects related
to optical/NIR/sub-mm polarimetry.
