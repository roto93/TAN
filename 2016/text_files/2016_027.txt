Dear Taiwanese community members,

     The science verification phase of SITELLE occurred from January
8-12 2016. The run was a success and we were able to verify that
SITELLE indeed performs well and is ready to do science.  A document
giving and introduction to FTS and outlining the latest results from
the science verification phase is now available. You will find it
here:

SITELLE is offered for the next CFHT round of LPs and the deadline for
this call for proposals is February 29 2016. You will find more
details here:

SITELLE will be scheduled during the 2016A semester and will also be
offered during the 2016B call for proposals.

The Instrument Scientist for SITELLE is now Daniel Devost who can be
contacted at devost@cfht.hawaii.edu. Don't hesitate to get in touch
with him if you have any questions about the instrument.

Daniel Devost for the SITELLE team.
