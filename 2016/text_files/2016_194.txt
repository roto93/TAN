-----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Third Announcement of the ALMA Band 1 Science Workshop, ASIAA, Taipei
    (Taiwan), 16-18 January 2017
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

   The ALMA Band 1 Science Workshop will take place at the ASIAA (Academia
   Sinica, Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics) in Taipei (Taiwan) from
   January 16 to 18 2017. It will consist of a few invited talks on the main
   scientific goals of ALMA Band 1, plus contributed talks. We also plan to
   have poster sessions. The ALMA Band 1 Science workshop will provide the
   first opportunity to show the exciting new science ALMA Band 1 can
deliver
   and to start preparing for the first observing proposals in the ALMA
lowest
   frequency band.

   The two days after the workshop, 19-20 January, will be dedicated to the
   discussion and planning of the upcoming Band 1 Science Verification
   phase. If you are interested in joining and/or in contributing to the
   Science Verification of Band 1, please write to the Project Scientist of
   Band 1, Oscar Morata (omorata@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw), so you can be
added to
   the list.


IMPORTANT DEADLINES
-------------------

   - extended deadline for abstract submission: December 4th, 2016
   - deadline for hotel reservations: December 14th, 2016
   - deadline for registration: January 1st, 2017


SCIENTIFIC GOAL
---------------

   Several key science cases have been proposed to be studied with the
Band 1
   Science Case aimed at greatly increasing the volume of the observable
   Universe and the range of observable frequencies and energies with
ALMA. The
   two main scientific goals of the ALMA Band 1 project are the study of the
   evolution of grains in protoplanetary disks, from mm to cm sizes, and the
   detection of molecular line emission from high-redshift galaxies, tracing
   molecular emission from redshifts z~1-10. Additionally, there is a broad
   range of science goals covered by ALMA Band 1: high-resolution and
   high-sensitivity observations of Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZE) in
galaxy
   clusters; observations of very small grains and spinning dust; study
of the
   fine structure of chemical differentiation in cloud cores, tracing
the very
   cold phase of the ISM and probing the smallest length scales of chemical
   variation; complex carbon-chain molecules, including the aminoacids and
   sugars from which life on Earth may have originally evolved; the
opportunity
   to measure the initial mass-to-flux ratio of molecular cores through the
   detection of the Zeeman effect in spectral lines (CCS), ...

*IAU Symposium S332 Astrochemistry VII =E2=80=93 Through the Cosmos from Ga=
laxies
to Planets*

*Puerto Varas, Chile 20-24 March 2017*



Dear Colleague,



We have a number of important deadlines now approaching and we would like
to remind you of these.  Please ensure that you take the necessary actions
before they pass.



*Hotel Discount Rates *
                                    *30 November 2016*



We have managed to negotiate an extension to our original deadline date. We
are holding block bookings at a number of hotels at discounted rates but
the final date to guarantee such rates is Wednesday 30 November. (This
overrides the previously announced 11 November deadline.) Note that no
payment is made at this time. The hotel will hold your reservation against
a current credit card.



If you have any problems making a reservation, please inform Maria
Cunningham (maria.cunningham@unsw.edu.au) and Gautier Mathys (
gmathys@eso.org). They will do their best to resolve any problems.

Information on hotels can be found at: https://iaus332.physics.
unsw.edu.au/local-information/accommodation/



Note that only three hotels (Cumbres, Caba=C3=B1a del Lago, and Patag=C3=B3=
nico)
provide booking at the discounted rate via their web reservation form; for
all other hotels, you should send a reservation request to the hotel via
email so as to benefit from the conference rate (see the specific
information for each hotel by following the respective =E2=80=9CMore info=
=E2=80=9D link
from the symposium accommodation web page).

Speaker:        Hsiao-Wen Chang (ASIAA)
Topic:          Epitaxial growth of NbN nanofilms on a 3C-SiC/Si substrate with high critical temperature
Time:           12/5 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
We have realized epitaxial 4.7 nm- NbN film on a (100)-oriented 3C-SiC/Si substrate by dc reactive magnetron sputtering at high temperature. This is further confirmed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). We present the first report of 1.3 nm shows a superconducting transition temperature of 8.8K, which is the highest reported for NbN films of comparable thickness. For comparison, the NbN films with a thickness between 1.3 and 6 nm were deposited, and the relationship between resistivity and superconducting properties of the differently thick NbN films are discussed. In addition, the aging effects of 2.6 nm-NbN film are also studied.



*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________
Speaker:        Andreas Schulze (NAOJ)
Topic:          Black hole growth and black hole - galaxy co-evolution
Time:           12/7 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Supermassive black holes (SMBHs), found in the center of galaxies, are thought to play an essential role in the evolution of galaxies. Their growth seems to be closely connected to the star formation history of their host galaxies. However, observationally there are still several fundamental unanswered questions regarding the growth of black holes. How is SMBH growth triggered and fueled? What role does AGN feedback and AGN outflows play for galaxy evolution? How do SMBHs grow over cosmic time scales? What role do SMBH mass and accretion rate play in their evolution? I will present recent results and upcoming projects to address these questions observationally and shed new light on the growth history of SMBHs and the connection to their host galaxies. In particular, I will discuss results on the cosmic evolution of the active black hole mass function, accretion rate function and AGN host galaxy mass function and their implications.
