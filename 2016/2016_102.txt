Dear all,

This is a friendly reminder.
The abstract submission deadline for the SMA workshop “SMA Science
in the Next Decade” is the end of this month.
Although the workshop aims to discuss the science cases with the wSMA
(the SMA with ultra wideband operation), it is also important to present
our science activities in this occasion.
You are welcome to present your results and ideas.

Please visit the workshop website,
        http://events.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/workshop/20161027/
and register now!

Best regards,

Naomi Hirano (ASIAA)
 on behalf of the SOC/LOC
