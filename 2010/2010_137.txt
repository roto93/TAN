Reminder:  Call for SMA proposals for 2010B

Dear Colleagues,

The ASIAA SMA Time Allocation Committee solicits proposals for
the ASIAA time of the Submillimeter Array (SMA) for the period
from 2010 November 16th to 2011 May 15 (2010B semester).
The ASIAA SMA time is open to those who are affiliated to
a Taiwanese university or a Taiwanese research institute.

The deadline for proposal submission for the ASIAA SMA time
for the 2010B semester is 2010 September 17 (Friday), 4AM in the
morning (Taiwan time).  [The deadline corresponds to September 16
(Thursday) 10AM in Hawaii, USA.]

All Taiwanese SMA proposals must be submitted through the SMA
submission facility (http://sma1.sma.hawaii.edu/proposing.html).
New proposers in particular need to get registered (through
the submission web site) before submitting a proposal.
Taiwanese proposers should select "ASIAA" as their destination
TAC in the submission web page.  Please direct your inquiries
(in particular PI eligibility) to TATSUHIKO HASEGAWA
(hasegawa AT asiaa.sinica.edu.tw).

For technical information on the SMA, please visit
     http://sma1.sma.hawaii.edu/proposing.html   .
The SAO SMA information page has been updated for 2010B.
For Taiwan and ASIAA specific aspects (including the PI
eligibility, the ASIAA proposal selection process, and the
amount of available observing time), please visit
      http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/~SMART/  .


Sincerely,

Tatsuhiko Hasegawa
ASIAA SMA TAC Chair

> Date: Wed, 8 Sep 2010 04:53:40 +0800

Dear All,

Prof. Chris Conselice from the University of Nottingham, UK, is visiting
Taiwan during the next two weeks. Prof. Conselice is a specialist of Galaxy
Evolution, and had published some groundbreaking articles on merging of
galaxies at high-redshift. He is based at NTNU in my office (B207L) up to the
16th of September. Please feel free to come, or calling me if you'd like to
give him a visit.

Also I have organized a mini-workshop on galaxy evolution on Thursday 9th,
from 12:00am. Prof. Conselice will give a 1h lecture (designed for graduate
students with a background on extragalactic astronomy) and I am planning to
have a discussion on Galaxy Evolution during the following hours. Prof.
Conselice is very keen to collaborate with Astronomers in Taiwan and it should
be a great opportunity to tie some links. If you'd like to attend the
mini-workshop please send me an email for more details.

Finally Prof. Conselice is giving a Colloquium at ASIAA on Thursday 16th. This
will be his last day in Taiwan, so please contact us before this date if you'd
like to have a chat with him.

Thank you very much.
Best regards,
Seb
