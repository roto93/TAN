Subject: invitation to join ASROC

Dear Colleagues,
as you know, ASROC is an academic society for you people working, or 
interested, in fields related to astronomy and astrophysics. The ASROC annual 
meeting has become more and more attractive and beneficial to the astronomy 
comminuty in Taiwan. Many of you have attended ASROC annual meetings. You are 
welcome to visit ASROC web site at http://www.asroc.org.tw/ for more 
information about ASROC.

On the other hand, you may not know that, although having enjoyed the annual 
meetings, many of you are not yet ASROC members. According to the current 
ASROC constitution, to become a member, a procedure of applying for membership 
is required. On behalf of the ASROC Council, I hereby sincerely invite you to 
join ASROC, if you are not yet a member. It is simple to do: please fill out 
one of the two attached forms and send it back to me, either electronic or 
hard copy via postal mail. If you are not sure whether you are a member, just 
contact me.

You will need to pay an admission fee of NTD 200 after your application is 
approved by the ASROC Council. I hope that amount won't bother you much. As a 
member, one needs to pay an annual membership fee of NTD 500 per year -- at 
the same time, a member is exempted from paying the registration fee of annual 
meetings for the amount up to the annual membership fee. For this year (2010), 
if you paid the registration fee for the ASROC 2010 annual meeting in May, the 
ASROC Council has decided to turn that registration fee into your 
membership fee, that is, you do not need to pay NTD 500 again for the 
membership fee this year.

ASROC has been trying to enhance its member benefit, with very limited 
resources. On the other hand, to have an active, healthy society is our common 
wish. It is an important ingredient of our astronomy community. It needs your 
support. 

Cheers,
