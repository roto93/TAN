  THE FIRST T2K NEUTRINO EVENT OBSERVED AT SUPER-KAMIOKANDE

The T2K collaboration has detected the first neutrino event 
at Super-Kamiokande at 6:00 on Feb.24 2010. The neutrino beam is 
produced by the J-PARC facility at Tokai and travels all the way 
under Japan to Super-Kamiokande, which is located 295km away from 
Tokai.

The T2K (Tokai-to-Kamioka) experiment aims to study neutrino 
oscillations with unprecedented precision and to unveil the 
unknown nature of the neutrino with the high intensity neutrinos 
from J-PARC and the world's largest detector, Super-Kamiokande.

The T2K collaboration successfully produced a neutrino beam at 
J-PARC in Apr. 2009 and has continued beam tuning. They detected 
neutrinos at the T2K near-detector, located at J-PARC, in Nov. 
2009, and on Feb.24, 2010 detected the first neutrino interaction 
at Super-Kamiokande.  Those achievement thus verified successful 
beam production and detector operation.

The first T2K neutrino event observed at Super-Kamiokande is 
a major milestone for the T2K experiment. Beam intensity will 
continue to be increased and the T2K collaboration will 
accumulate many more neutrino events at Super-Kamiokande that 
will be used to search for a new type of neutrino oscillation 
with the world's best sensitivity.

The T2K collaboration consists of about 500 physicists from 62 
institutes in 12 countries (Japan, South Korea, Canada, the 
United States, the United Kingdom, France, Spain, Italy, 
Switzerland, Germany, Poland, and Russia).
The complete list of institutions can be found at:

Subject: SKA Newsletter Vol 17

Dear All, 

SKA Newsletter vol. 17 is now available from
www.skatelescope.org/PDF/news/SKA_NEWSLETTER_VOLUME_17.pdf.

Apologies for the delay in publishing the latest SKA Newsletter - it's been
a tremendously busy time on the project as staff at the SPDO have focused on
the recent System Conceptual Design Review meeting and preparations for the
SKA 2010 science and engineering meeting in Manchester, GB, on 22-25 March
2010.

The format of the SKA Newsletter will change to a quarterly e-newsletter
from the next issue. The new format will be easier to digest and will ensure
that everyone is kept regularly updated with progress. Expect the new-look
SKA newsletter to arrive in your inbox in July.

Updates to the International SKA website include:
