Dear Yi-Jehng,


We are now seeking for the SMA observing assistant in Taiwan.
This is a part time job, and the duty is carrying our the second-shift operation of the array
 from Taiwan (every Friday, 8 p.m. -- (usually) 3 a.m.).
In addition to this, the person is supposed to stay in Hawaii for several weeks per year
in order to help the array operation at the summit and to maintain the operation skill.


Would you mind if I ask you to post this information to TAN?


The job description is in the following URL,

Thank you,
Naomi

                   Oxford Physics Conference Series
                       MOLECULES IN GALAXIES

                University of Oxford, 26-30 July 2010
                 http://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/mmconf/

This is the first announcement for the conference "Molecules in
Galaxies", to be held at the University of Oxford, United Kingdom, on
26-30 July 2010.

Programme:
----------

Understanding galaxy formation and evolution is at the heart of modern
astronomy. Central to that goal is the necessity to improve our
understanding of star formation, and thus the evolution of the
interstellar medium of galaxies, where molecular gas plays a key
role. Given the numerous current instrumental efforts at mm and sub-mm
wavelengths, a conference reviewing our knowledge of the field and
delineating future research directions is both timely and exciting.

The conference will therefore cover a large fraction of research
related to molecular gas, star formation and dust in galaxies, both
near and far. Topics include but are not restricted to:

Molecular Gas Census:
     Galactic Center and Milky Way
     Magellanic Clouds and local galaxies
     Dwarf, spiral, lenticular, elliptical galaxies
     (Central) cluster galaxies and cooling flows
     High-redshift galaxies, radio galaxies, QSOs
     Cosmological accretion
Molecular and Atomic Line Diagnostics:
     Physical conditions
     Excitation mechanisms (PDRs, XDRs)
     Inter-relationships of molecular tracers
     Atomic-molecular balance
     Starburst and AGN evolution
     Chemistry
Star Formation:
     SF census (normal galaxies, LIRGS, ULIRGS; field vs clusters)
     SF rate, efficiency and history
     SF laws
     SF feedback and outflows
Dust:
     Formation and evolution
     Dependence on environment (Milky Way, low-metallicity galaxies,
high-z galaxies)
     Molecular gas-dust relationship
     PAHs
     FIR/sub-mm lines and diagnostics
     Early Herschel results

Invited speakers include:
Leo Blitz (*), Martin Bureau, Daniela Calzetti, Bruce Draine, Dusan
Keres, Mark Krumholz, Fred Lahuis, Crystal Martin, Mikako Matsuura,
Chris McKee, Desika Narayanan, Erik Rosolowsky, Marco Spaans, Gordon
Stacey, Linda Tacconi, Jean Turner, Fabian Walter, Christine Wilson
(* to be confirmed)

Full information on the scientific rationale, scientific programme,
social programmme, venue, accomodation, transport, etc, is available
on the symposium web site:
http://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/mmconf/

Registration and Abstract Submission:
-------------------------------------

Registration and abstract submission are now open, with a closing date
of Friday 30 April 2010:
http://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/mmconf/registration/

Summer School:
--------------

A three-day summer school will take place just before the conference,
on 21-23 July 2010. The school is jointly organised by the
Astrophysics Department of the University of Oxford and the Global
Center of Excellence "Quest for Fundamental Principles in the
Universe" of the Physics Department at Nagoya University. It is
intended to give students and postdoctoral fellows both a much broader
and a more basic overview of topics that will be covered during the
conference.

Under the heading "The Gaseous Universe", the idea of the school is to
cover the physical mechanisms and observational diagnostics available
at each temperature and thus wavelength range. The exact programme is
still under construction, but confirmed speakers and topics include:
Yasuo Fukui, University of Nagoya (Sum-mm/mm and Molecular
Astrophysics); Hidehiro Kaneda, University of Nagoya (Space Infrared
Astrophysics); Marc Sarzi, University of Hertfordshire (Warm/Ionised
Gas and NIR-Optical-UV Line Ratio Diagnostics); Adrianne Slyz,
University of Oxford (Computational Hydrodynamics in Galaxy
Formation).

Participation in the conference is not a prerequisite for
participation in the school, and there is no school registration
fee. However, a separate school registration is required:

CASA Workshop:
--------------

This is still under discussion, but it is likely that a two-day
hands-on workshop on CASA will take place before the conference and
summer school, on 19-20 July 2010. CASA is the data reduction and
analysis software for the next generation of radio telescopes,
including ALMA. Information will appear on the conference website in
due course.

Critical Dates:
---------------

30 April 2010: Deadline, registration and abstract submission
TBD May  2010: Deadline, payment (registration fee, block-booked
accomodation, etc)
21 July  2010: Start of summer school
26 July  2010: Start of conference

SOC:
----

Martin Bureau (chair), Susanne Aalto, Leo Blitz, Leonardo Bronfman,
Paola Caselli, Francoise Combes, Yasuo Fukui, George Helou, Paul Ho,
Rob Kennicutt, Carol Lonsdale, Fabian Walter, Lisa Young, Min Yun

Please circulate this announcement within your institute if at all
possible. We hope to see you in Oxford,
