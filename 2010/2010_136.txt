Dear All,

Prof. Chris Conselice from the University of Nottingham, UK, is visiting
Taiwan during the next two weeks. Prof. Conselice is a specialist of Galaxy
Evolution, and had published some groundbreaking articles on merging of
galaxies at high-redshift. He is based at NTNU in my office (B207L) up to the
16th of September. Please feel free to come, or calling me if you'd like to
give him a visit.

Also I have organized a mini-workshop on galaxy evolution on Thursday 9th,
from 12:00am. Prof. Conselice will give a 1h lecture (designed for graduate
students with a background on extragalactic astronomy) and I am planning to
have a discussion on Galaxy Evolution during the following hours. Prof.
Conselice is very keen to collaborate with Astronomers in Taiwan and it should
be a great opportunity to tie some links. If you'd like to attend the
mini-workshop please send me an email for more details.

Finally Prof. Conselice is giving a Colloquium at ASIAA on Thursday 16th. This
will be his last day in Taiwan, so please contact us before this date if you'd
like to have a chat with him.

Thank you very much.
Best regards,
Seb
