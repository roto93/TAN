Subject: Call for Proposal for CFHT 10B: correction and additional info


Dear CFHT Users,  ### Important!!! ###

 

Here are some corrections on the call for proposal I forwarded last
week.

 

(1)   It turned out GriF is not available for CFHT observations. The
www pages will be

corrected soon.

 

(2)   Some new staff and post-docs may want to know the period of the
semester 10B.

It is August 2010 to January 2011. We will add this info on our call
for proposal page

for CFHT Taiwan Time soon.

 

Best regards,

 

Hiro Takami, TAC Chair
