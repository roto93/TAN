Subject: 2010 CFHT User's Meeting (CFHT DECADE 4) in Taiwan

Dear Colleagues,

The 9th CFHT User's Meeting (CFHT DECADE 4)
will be held in ASIAA, from Nov 16 to 18, 2010.
It will be the first time that CFHT user's meeting
is held outside Canada, France, and US.

The Taiwanese astronomical community started to 
collaborate with CFHT since 2001 and will still be
an important part of the CFHT community for the
next decade. It will be a great opportunity to share
our scientific results to the worldwide CFHT users,
and exchange experience and knowledge.

We encourage all of you to participate in the meeting. 
The detailed information of the meeting can be found
