 			  First ANNOUNCEMENT
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 	    2nd Summer School on Multiwavelength Astronomy
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 			28 June - 9 July  2010
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 		      Amsterdam, The Netherlands
----------------------------------------------------------------------

WEB:    http://www.black-hole.eu/mwschool2
EMAIL:  mwschool@black-hole.eu
POSTER: http://www.black-hole.eu/mwschool2/poster.pdf

The European Union FP7/ITN network "Black Hole Universe" is pleased to
announce a 2-week summer school in Amsterdam, the Netherlands,
entitled the "Second Summer School on Multiwavelength Astronomy".

Scientific rationale
====================

Our current understanding of accretion onto black holes and neutron
stars has evolved greatly in the past 20 years, thanks largely to the
plethora of scientific data available at all wavelengths.

Advances in the X-ray band have been made possible by recent
satellites such as XMM-Newton, Chandra, INTEGRAL, RXTE, Swift, and
Suzaku, while the new gamma-ray satellite Fermi is in the early stages
of what promises to be a very discovery-laden mission. The same is
true for radio astronomy, with many discoveries from existing
world-leading radio-astronomical observatories such the ATCA, the VLA,
the VLBA, the EVN, and MERLIN, with a range of major planned upgrades
to these facilities, plus additional facilities in planning or
construction stages such as ALMA, ASCAP, MeerKAT and eventually SKA.

Clearly, given these developments, there is a pressing need for more
researchers capable of exploiting the enormous volume of upcoming
scientific data across the broadband. In this context, we announce an
international summer school with the aim of providing young
researchers the necessary expertise and skills to independently
analyze and interpret multiwavelength data pertaining to in particular
accretion physics. Therefore we focus on the radio and X-ray/gamma-ray
bands.

The school will span two weeks, with each week roughly focused on
radio and X-ray/gamma-ray analysis, respectively. The program will
include a mixture of lectures as well as practical, hands-on data
analysis sessions (using, for example, AIPS, CASA, ISIS, XSPEC). The
school will also include some science talks and complementary skills
training. Priority will be given to hands-on sessions performing real
data-analysis. Please check the webpages regularly:

http://www.black-hole.eu/mwschool2

for additional information on the exact program of the school as
becomes available.

Confirmed teachers include T. Belloni (I), K. Blundell (UK), L.
Burderi (I), T. DiSalvo (I), E. Kalemci (TU), B. Kelly (USA), M. van
der Klis (NL), E. Koerding (F), S. Markoff (NL), J. McEnery (USA), J.
Miller-Jones (USA), M. Nowak (USA), I. Papadakis (G), M. Ribo (SP), A.
Richards (UK), J. Rodriguez (F), P. Uttley (UK), J. Wilms (D), R.
Wijnands (NL), M. Wise (NL).

The audience targeted by the school is primarily PhD students, but we
will consider admitting a few early-stage postdocs. We have chosen a 2
week duration in order to allow a wider coverage of scientific topics,
as well as ample time for discussions and practice.

Venue and accommodation
-----------------------

The school will be held on the Science Park Campus of the University
of Amsterdam, located in a renovated area 10 minutes by train from
Amsterdam Central Station. A block of rooms has been reserved for
students at a nearby hotel.

Application and financial support
---------------------------------

The housing costs will be subsidized for all students, however fuller
financial support will be provided for a limited number of PhD
students who submit complete applications, and plan to attend for the
entire duration of the program. Justification for the request must be
explained in the application. We anticipate being able to offer about
ten grants, where support will come in the form of additional
accommodation subsidies, and/or a per diem. In all cases, participants
must pay the registration fee. Travel support may be considered for
only very exceptional cases.

Last year's school was oversubscribed by a factor of 3, thus we expect
this year to be similarly competitive for admission. Interested
parties should send the application forms below, as well as PDFs of
their CV, a letter of motivation for attending the school, and have
preferably two letters of reference sent, all to the organizers at
mwschool@black-hole.eu.

The deadline for receipt of admission and financial aid applications,
and letters of reference, is midnight (CET) on 22 March, 2010.

The registration fee is 200 Euros, and accommodation for 13 nights (27
June - 10 July) will cost only 350 Euros, payment form TBD. There will
be no refund possible in case of partial attendance.

The number of participants is limited to 35 in order to facilitate the
hands-on sessions that are a significant part of the school.


Committees

SOC: T. Belloni (I), K. Blundell (UK), S. Corbel (F), E. Kalemci (TR),
S. Markoff (NL, Chair), J. Miller-Jones (USA), A. Richards (UK),

ASIAA Call for SMA proposals for 2010A

Dear Colleagues,

The ASIAA SMA Time Allocation Committee solicits proposals for
the ASIAA time of the Submillimeter Array (SMA) for the period
from 2010 May 16th to 2010 November 15th (2010A semester).
The ASIAA SMA time is open to those who are affiliated to
a Taiwanese university or a Taiwanese research institute.

The deadline for proposal submission for the ASIAA SMA time
for the 2010A semester is 2010 March 12 (Friday), 4AM in the
morning (Taiwan time).  [The deadline corresponds to March 11
(Thursday) 10AM in Hawaii, USA, and 4PM EDTin Cambridge, USA.]

All Taiwanese SMA proposals must be submitted through the SMA
submission facility (http://sma1.sma.hawaii.edu/proposing.html).
New proposers in particular need to get registered (through
the submission web site) before submitting a proposal.
Taiwanese proposers should select "ASIAA" as their destination
TAC in the submission web page.  Please direct your inquiries
(in particular PI eligibility) to TATSUHIKO HASEGAWA
(hasegawa AT asiaa.sinica.edu.tw).

For technical information on the SMA, please visit
     http://sma1.sma.hawaii.edu/proposing.html   .
The SAO SMA information page has been updated for 2010A.
For Taiwan and ASIAA specific aspects (including the PI
eligibility, the ASIAA proposal selection process, and the
amount of available observing time), please visit
     http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/~SMART/  .

A few cautions about proposal format and writing merit reiterating.
- In addition to the page limit, there are limits to the font size
    (11 point or larger) and layout (two pages for text only and two
    pages for figures, tables, and references).
- A request for a good weather without a compelling reason tends to
    get a lower rating from reviewers.

Additional messages from the ASIAA SMA TAC :

A PI (Principal Investigator) should lead the proposed project, and
is expected to be the first author of the resulting papers.  If a PI
will not be able to do these, the PI should provide the reason in the
proposal.  For example, in a multi-wavelength, international campaign,
the PI for an SMA proposal may not be leading the entire project or
going to be the first author.  In such a case, the PI should provide
the background or circumstance in the proposal.

Should a PI become unable to do the work, Co-Is (Co-Investigators)
are expected to follow up the analysis and publication of already
executed or allocated projects under the PI.  Co-investigators should
be aware of their responsibilities or obligations.  PIs should make
best efforts to obtain a consent before putting someone's name on a
proposal as a Co-I.

The PI of a successful proposal will be encouraged to provide an
observer at the summit of Mauna Kea.  For more details, please
consult the ASIAA web page listed above.

In order to encourage PhD students to use the SMA, the ASIAA SMA TAC
will make some considerations to proposals for PhD thesis projects.
Please visit the ASIAA web site for details.

The SMA is a complex instrument.  Consultation or collaboration
with those who are familiar with the SMA is recommended.  Contact
points for consultation are also found in the ASIAA web page
listed above.

Sincerely,

Tatsuhiko Hasegawa
ASIAA SMA TAC Chair
