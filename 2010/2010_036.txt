Subject: SKA Newsletter Vol 17

Dear All, 

SKA Newsletter vol. 17 is now available from
www.skatelescope.org/PDF/news/SKA_NEWSLETTER_VOLUME_17.pdf.

Apologies for the delay in publishing the latest SKA Newsletter - it's been
a tremendously busy time on the project as staff at the SPDO have focused on
the recent System Conceptual Design Review meeting and preparations for the
SKA 2010 science and engineering meeting in Manchester, GB, on 22-25 March
2010.

The format of the SKA Newsletter will change to a quarterly e-newsletter
from the next issue. The new format will be easier to digest and will ensure
that everyone is kept regularly updated with progress. Expect the new-look
SKA newsletter to arrive in your inbox in July.

Updates to the International SKA website include:
