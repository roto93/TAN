1. UCAT Postdoctoral Position Openings (Deadline: Dec 01)
2. EA Interferometry Winter School (Deadline: Nov 15)

UCAT Postdoctoral Position Openings
--------------------------------------

Institution: University Consortium of ALMA-Taiwan

The University Consortium of ALMA-Taiwan (UCAT) has four immediate openings
for postdoctoral positions. The postdoc appointments will initially be for
two years, with possible extension for additional years based on satisfactory
performance.

Taiwan has joined the ALMA project through collaborations with Japan and North
America. To promote ALMA research in universities, UCAT was formed by five
leading Universities in radio astronomy in Taiwan - National Central
University, National Cheng Kung University, National Taiwan Normal University,
National Tsing Hua University, and Tamkang University. Areas of research
interests of the UCAT faculty include Solar Physics, Solar System, Star
Formation, Astrochemistry, Active Galaxies, Galaxy Evolution, and Cosmology.
More information on each topic can be found at our home page
( http://www.es.ntnu.edu.tw/tuCASA ).

Scientists with radio interferometry background are preferred; however, all
candidates with a PhD in any area of astronomy interested to conduct research
using ALMA are encouraged to apply. UCAT postdoctoral fellows are expected to
conduct their research at one of the five UCAT universities. Being in a
Taiwanese research institute, UCAT postdoctoral fellows have the privilege to
apply for Taiwan's share of observing time for CFHT, SMA, and the Arizona 12-m
(KP12M) and 10-m (SMT) radio telescopes.

Applicants should submit the following documents to tuCASA@ntnu.edu.tw by 2010
December 01 for full consideration: 

  1. a curriculum vitae
  2. a brief summary of past research experience
  3. a future research plan

Applicants are also requested to arrange three letters of recommendation to be
sent to: Prof. Yi-Jehng Kuan, Chair, Department of Earth Sciences, National
Taiwan Normal University, Taipei 11677, Taiwan. Email: tuCASA@ntnu.edu.tw
