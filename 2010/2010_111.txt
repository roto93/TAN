========================= SECOND ANNOUNCEMENT =========================

                    International scientific conference

        Fast X-ray timing and spectroscopy at extreme count rates
       Science with the HTRS on the International X-ray Observatory

                 7-11 February 2011, Champery, Switzerland

                     http://www.isdc.unige.ch/htrs2011/


The International X-ray Observatory (IXO) is one of the three
remaining Class-L projects in ESA's Cosmic Vision program. The High
Time Resolution Spectrometer (HTRS) is one of the five proposed
instrument, whose aim is to exploit to the fullest the enormous
throughput of the IXO mirrors by permitting observations of extremely
bright sources with very high efficiency.

In order to stimulate the community to maximize the science impact of
the HTRS, we are organizing a scientific conference on the science
with the HTRS in Champery in the Swiss Alps from February 7 until
February 11, 2011.

The Conference program will leave ample time for informal meetings and
discussions, as well as wonderful Winter activities.

Registration
------------
Registration can be made on the Conference web site until Oct. 1, 2010:

            http://www.isdc.unige.ch/htrs2011/registration

The registration fee (CHF 400.-) includes conference, coffee breaks
and all evening meals from Sunday Feb. 6 until Thursday Feb. 10.

Passing the Oct. 1 deadline, the registration fee will be increased to
CHF 550.- until the final registration dead line on Dec. 10, 2010

Abstract submission
-------------------
Abstract can be submitted at anytime on the Conference web site:

              http://www.isdc.unige.ch/htrs2011/abstract

until the submission dead line on October 1, 2010.

The selection of the contributed talks and the final program will be
announced on Dec. 25, 2010.

Proceedings
-----------
The proceedings will be published electronically in the Proceedings
of Science.

Meeting location
----------------
The conference will take place in Champery, in the Swiss Alps. Champery
is a wonderful place for all kinds of indoor and outdoor Winter
activities. It is part of the largest internationally connected ski area
in the world, les Portes du Soleil, with more than 650 km ski tracks,
among which the Pas de Chavanette, one of the most impressive ski track
in the world. Participants to the conference and accompanying persons
will get a 15% rebate on ski passes.

Accommodations
--------------
We have pre-reserved rooms in several hotels in the area. More
information is available on the web site. For other Travel information,
go to the web page of the Conference:

Support for Ph.D. students
--------------------------
We plan to waive the registration fee for a certain number of Ph.D.
students. Requests can be made at the time of registration. Selection
will be made on the basis of the proposed contribution and of the
originating country of the student.


We look forward to meeting you in Champery!
