Reminder:  Call for SMA proposals for 2010B

Dear Colleagues,

The ASIAA SMA Time Allocation Committee solicits proposals for
the ASIAA time of the Submillimeter Array (SMA) for the period
from 2010 November 16th to 2011 May 15 (2010B semester).
The ASIAA SMA time is open to those who are affiliated to
a Taiwanese university or a Taiwanese research institute.

The deadline for proposal submission for the ASIAA SMA time
for the 2010B semester is 2010 September 17 (Friday), 4AM in the
morning (Taiwan time).  [The deadline corresponds to September 16
(Thursday) 10AM in Hawaii, USA.]

All Taiwanese SMA proposals must be submitted through the SMA
submission facility (http://sma1.sma.hawaii.edu/proposing.html).
New proposers in particular need to get registered (through
the submission web site) before submitting a proposal.
Taiwanese proposers should select "ASIAA" as their destination
TAC in the submission web page.  Please direct your inquiries
(in particular PI eligibility) to TATSUHIKO HASEGAWA
(hasegawa AT asiaa.sinica.edu.tw).
