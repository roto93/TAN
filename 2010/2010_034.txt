 Proposals for CFHT Open for Semester 2010B

############################################

The 3.6 meter optical/infrared Canadian-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) is
now open
for proposals from all Taiwan-based researchers for semester 2010B. The
deadline
for proposal submission is: 

1 April 2010 - 8:00 am Taiwan time 

We anticipate that a minimum of 5 nights, and possibly up to 10 nights, will
be
available in semester 2010B, depending on demand and quality of proposals.
Please
note that the instruments available for 2010B are MegaCam, WIRCam, ESPaDOnS,
and PUEO with KIR/GriF.
Detailed information on the telescope, available instrumentation, proposal
format, and how to submit proposals is available from the CFHT web page: 

http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/en/science/Proposals/

### Important Changes ###
1. PIs should take note that they will use a new Phase 1 tool and that
   Poopsy is no longer available but to retrieve old proposals. 
   See the above page for details.
   Thus, we encourage the PIs to work on her/his proposals earlier.
   Starting at the last minute will not be a good idea.

2. As some TAC members have workd for us for many years, they are replaced
   as the new members. The present members thus are:-

     Hiro Takami (ASIAA, chair), Shiang-Yu Wang (ASIAA), Yoichi Oyama
(ASIAA),
     Shih-Ping, Lai (NTHU), Daisuke Kinoshita (NCU), Howard Yee (U.
Toronoto)

### Exploratory Programs ###

To encourage innovative science, this semester we will continue considering
"exploratory" programs using MegaCam, WIRCam, or ESPaDOnS that require
no more than 1 hour of observing time. Such proposals will not be refereed,
but will
be scrutinized by the TAC and allocated time based on scientific merit and
feasibility.
When submitting such proposals, please state at the beginning of the
scientific 
justification that "This is an EXPLORATORY proposal".

### Queued Service Observations Snapshot Programs ###

In addition, we would like to bring to your attention the Queued Service
Observation
(QSO) snapshot program. These are programs that can be executed with either
MegaCam or WIRCam in relatively poor seeing conditions when the seeing is
>1.2".
Projects executed under the QSO snapshot program are not charged to the
available
observing time for Taiwan. Proposals to the QSO snapshot program will not be
refereed, 
but will be scrutinized by the TAC for scientific value and feasibility. 

### Resubmission due to Lost Time ###

If your scheduled project from previous semesters was not completed for any
reason
(including bad weather), you will need to resubmit your proposal explaining
why you
need more time. Your proposal will be stronger if the available data has
been analyzed,
and you use this data to demonstrate that the stated science goals can be
achieved
with allocation of the full requested time. 

### Time Allocation Process ###

All new proposals, and where deemed necessary resubmitted proposals, are
refereed by
researchers selected by the Taiwan-CFHT TAC based on their demonstrated
expertise
in the relevant research fields. 
Apart from the referees comments, who are asked to evaluate primarily the
scientific
strength of the proposal, the Taiwan-CFHT TAC also takes into account
technical
feasibility. For those who have previously been scheduled observing time on
the CFHT,
the Taiwan-CFHT TAC will also take into account the  status of previously
executed
projects and publications. 

### Status of Previous Proposals ###

Please fill in or update the status of all your previous projects on the web
page 

https://oir.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/cfht/ [Authentication required] 

You can and should provide more details on the progress of previous
(especially related)
projects in the relevant section of your proposal. If no information is
forthcoming,
the TAC will assume that no progress has been made and will take this into 
consideration in allocation of observing time.
