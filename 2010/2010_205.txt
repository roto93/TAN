*********************************************************************** 
*             2011 European Radio Interferometry School               * 
*********************************************************************** 

We are happy to announce that the Fourth European Radio Interferometry 
School will take place in Rimini (Italy), in the week 

                       5 - 9 September 2011 

ERIS will provide a week of lectures and tutorials on how to get 
scientific results from radio interferometry.  Topics covered 
include: 
* Calibration and imaging continuum, spectral line and polarization data 
* Extracting the information and interpreting the results 
* Specific features for VLBI, high frequency (ALMA domain) and low 
frequency observations (LOFAR domain) 
* Choosing the most suited array and observing plan for your project. 

Participants are expected to bring their own laptops, equipped with 
the most widely-used packages such as AIPS, CASA and Parseltongue. 
Most examples will be drawn from cm-wave instruments such as VLA, EVN 
and MERLIN but experts for arrays from LOFAR to ALMA will be available. 

The school will be held at the Sporting Hotel, where the participants 
and lecturers will also be accomodated. 
See the hotel web page at http://www.hotelsportingrimini.com/ 

A registration fee of 150 Euro is requested, which will cover the 
accomodation and half board for the 5 days of the school, from 
the arrival on 5 September 2011 to the departure on 10 September 2011. 
Participants will be accomodated in double and triple rooms. 

Please reply to this email, eris2011@ira.inaf.it, indicating your 
interest to be notified of future announcements. 

Forms for registration and hotel booking and further instructions will 
soon be made available. Note that due to logistical limitations 
we will be able to accomodate around 80 participants, so we encourage 
to send your interest and register as soon as possible.
