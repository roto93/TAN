Dear All, 

This is an announcement of the NTNU HEP seminar of the Physics Department on 
Sept 14. The talk is given by Prof. Christopher Conselice from University of 
Nottingham, UK. The detail is in the following. Please note that the seminar 
is on Tuesday rather than on the usual Thursday. Everyone is welcome.

Venue: F104, Physics Department, NTNU 
Speaker: Prof. Christopher J. Conselice (Nottingham) 
Title: New trends in Galaxy Formation studies 

Abstract: 
I will review recent progress on galaxy formation and evolution, concentrating 
on the latest and most developed methods for understanding the formation of 
galaxies and galaxy properties.  This includes theoretical interpretations, 
direct investigations as well as probes of galaxy populations themselves. 
Methods for galaxy formation I will review include: galaxy merging, galaxy gas 
accretion, as well as star formation processes.  I will argue that we are 
making progress, but that there is still much to learn about the processes and 
history of galaxy assembly, and give several examples of how future progress 
will be made. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

Prof. Conselice is an expert in formation and evolution of galaxies. His main 
contribution includes aspects on early galaxy formation, low-mass galaxy 
formation, etc. He has over 100 papers and, in the mean time, is also an 
outstanding public science writer. In 2009, Prof.Conselice received Leverhulme 
Prize in Astronomy & Astrophysics. 

Best Wishes, 

Shou-Huang
