Objective and Scope:
The objective of CPS International School of Planetary Sciences is to
promote education and research in planetary sciences for highly
motivated graduate students and young

researchers worldwide. It will offer them an opportunity to interact
with leading scientists in a specific field of the year. Note that
???lanetary Sciences?includes astronomy (astrophysics,
astrochemistry, astrobiology, etc.), geosciences, space science, and
other related fields.

Topic of the coming school
Theory of Stellar Evolution and Its Applications ?from the First Stars
to Planet-Hosting Stars and Gas Giant Planets

The main part of the school will be a series of lectures on the
structure and evolution of stars with various masses including gas giant
planets and on the effects of mass loss and stellar

rotation upon them. Then a series of lectures follow on their
contributions to the nucleosynthesis and chemical evolution of the Milky
Way and dwarf galaxies in the local group and to the

evolutionary characteristics of planet-hosting stars from theoretical
and observational viewpoints.
The development of our understandings in these fields has been achieved
by recent observations with large ground-based telescopes and space
telescopes and owing to large-scaled

surveys of metal-poor stars, supernova searches and searches for
exo-planetary systems.

CPS 7th International School has a special session dedicated to the
memory of Prof. Chushiro Hayashi who was one of the founders of the
theory of stellar evolution and passed away in

2010.

Internationally well-established experts in various fields will review
recent progress in our understandings of those fields. The lecturers and
their topics are listed below:

Daiichiro Sugimoto ?The University of Tokyo, Japan)
????--Why the Stars and the Universe evolve? --- Fundamentals of Stellar
Structure and Evolution and Their Gravothermal Natures
