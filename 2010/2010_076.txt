Subject: ASROC 2010 final circular
   
Dear Prof Kuan, 

Could you help to distribute the ASROC 2010 final circular to the TAN? 
(I will send it to individual participants too.) 

Thank you very much, 

Wei-Hao 

Astronomical Society of the Republic of China 2010 Annual Meeting   
Final Circular 

1. Program and Oral Contributions 
At the end of the circular, please find the latest version of the   
program and 
schedule. The meeting will start at 9:00 AM on May 29 (Saturday) and   
finish 
at 5:00 PM on May 30. 

2. Oral Contributions 
The oral contributions had been selected and are listed at the end of 
this circular. Please find your name there. Each contributed talk has 
15 minutes including questions. We will provide computers for your 
presentation files. Speakers will be contacted by the LOC regarding 
the file format. At this moment, we strongly suggest speakers to at 
least prepare a PDF version of your presentation. 

3. Poster Contributions 
All abstracts that are not selected as oral contributions should be 
presented as posters.  We recommend A1 (width * height = 59.4cm *   
84.1cm) 
for the size of your posters.  We will not be responsible for posters 
that are much larger than A1.  You will be able to put on your posters 
from 8:00 AM on May 29 (Saturday).  We will provide the necessary tools. 

4. Venue 
The meeting will be hold at the 1st floor of the Astronomy-Mathematics 
Building in the NTU main campus: 
http://www.asroc.org.tw/asroc2010/en/traliv_place-e.html 
There will be no parallel sessions so all sessions will be in the 
lecture hall on the 1st floor of the building. 

5. Friday Reception Party and ASIAA Colloquium 
There will be a warm up for the main ASROC meeting on May 28 (Friday). 
In the afternoon from 16:00, there will be two special colloquium talks 
in ASIAA, given by Dr. Nobunari Kashikawa and Dr. Tomonori Usuda from 
NAOJ, on Japanese TMT instrumentation projects. Everyone who registered 
in the ASROC meeting is welcome to join the ASIAA colloquium.  Following 
the colloquium, from 17:30, we will hold a reception party for the 
ASROC meeting participants. We will provide drink and light food. All 
activities on this date will be on the *** 12F *** of the Astronomy- 
Mathematics Building, where the ASIAA auditorium is. Please take the 
elevators to go to the 11th floor, and walk up to the 12th floor. 

6. Check-in/Registration 
Check-in and registration will start at 8:00AM on May 29 (Saturday). 
Because the meeting will start at 9:00AM, we encourage everyone to   
arrive 
early and check in. Registration fee (500 NTD) will be collected during 
the check-in. Note that there will be *** no check-in *** on May 28. 
Late registration at the door will also be accepted. 

7. Food and Meals 
We will provide lunch on both May 29 and 30.  We will provide light 
food in the morning.  However, we suggest you to have breakfast in 
your hotel first before coming to the meeting. 

8. Banquet 
There will be a buffet-style banquet on May 29 (Saturday) following the 
afternoon session. We will provide nice food, drink, and entertainment. 

9. Student Lunch on May 29 
Students will be provided an opportunity to chat with senior astronomers 
in ASIAA (Paul Ho, Typhoon Lee, and Makoto Inoue) during the lunch of 
May 29. The goal is for students to interact with astronomers outside 
their home institutes and to improve the interaction between ASIAA and 
universities. Students will be asked in the check-in whether they would 
like to join this. 

10. Wireless Internet 
We will do our best to provide wireless internet connection. However, 
we will not provide power for your laptops.
