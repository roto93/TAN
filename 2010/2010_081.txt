Subject: A new ALMA website
   
Dear Yi-Jehng, 

    We have a new ALMA website up and running at 

     http://alma.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/

and it can be assessed from the ASIAA website. It has two parts, 
one is General information and one is Taiwan-ARC & Observing with ALMA. 

  Could you please circulate this message in the TAN? Thank you! 

Best Regards, 
Chin-Fei
