Subject: Re: The Second APCosPA Winter School/workshop 


                                         December 14, 2010
Dear Colleagues:

     I apologize that the pace for the organization of the 2nd APcosPA 
Winter School/Workshop is somewhat slow - but in a good progress. At this 
point, we again anticipate that there are about 10 "students" (senoir 
graduate students, young postdocs, etc.) from China (Beida, Jao-Tung, 
etc.), more than 6 from South Korea, a few from Japan, and so on. The 
domestic participation is limited to about 40. We would like to choose, at 
the end of the program, a few "students" for awards. This message is 
intended so that you would encourage your best "students" to participate 
this competition, with the deadline to register as 7 January 2011.
 
     Merry Christmas and Happy New Year !!     

     Best wishes, W-Y. Pauchy Hwang
                  President, APCosPA Org

> Dear Colleagues:
  
       The pace of the advancement in the area of Cosmology and Particle 
  Astrophysics (CosPA) is amazedly fast since the new century. The 
  researchers in the Asia Pacific region, including Australia, China, 
  Japan, Korea, Taiwan, etc., have played their due roles in making the 
  progresses. To make our marks more noticeable, we are forming the Asia 
  Pacific Organization for Cosmology and Particle Astrophysics (APCosPA 
  Org), starting from nothing but hopefully growing eventually into 
  something fairly visible.
  
       One beginning is to hold the First APCosPA Winter School, 18-29 
  January 2010, at National Taiwan University, Taipei, and now the Second 
  APCosPA Winter School/Workshop, January 17-28, also at NTU, Taipei. We 
  will try to cover the various topics in Cosmology and Particle 
  Astrophysics but mainly toward the graduate students and young 
  researchers. The anticipated lecturers (except the workshop period) 
  include:
 
       Chia-Hung Vincent Chang (NTNU, Taiwan)
       Pisin Chen (NTU, Taiwan)
       Kiwoon Choi (KAIST, Korea)
       Bruce Dawson (Adelaide, Australia)
       Xiao-Gang He (NTU, Taiwan) 
       Stephen D.H. Hsu (Oregon, USA)
       Sang Pyo Kim (Kunsan, Korea)
       Hyun Kyu Lee (Hanyang Univ, Korea)
       Miao Li (ITP, Beijing)
       Bo-Qiang Ma (Beida, Beijing)
       Jen-Chieh Peng (UIUC, USA)
       Alexei Starobinsky (Laudau Inst, Russia)
       Bin Wang (SJTU, China)
       David Wiltshire (Canterbury Univ, NZ)
       Anthony Zee (UCSB, USA) 
> 
  Each will give two or three lectures, with a couple of hard problems. 
  The registered students or young postdocs could enter the competitions 
  with the awards given to the first few "students".
