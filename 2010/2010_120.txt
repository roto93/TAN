PRE-REGISTRATION OPEN FOR ALMA WORKSHOP 
      Anthony Remijan (NRAO) and Gerald Schieven (NRC) 

Pre-registration is open for the "ALMA: Extending the Limits of 
Astrophysical Spectroscopy" workshop that will be held 15-17 January 2011 
in Victoria, British Columbia. 

The National Research Council of Canada, the North American ALMA Science 
Center, and the Center for Chemistry of the Universe are jointly hosting 
this workshop that will highlight the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter 
Array (ALMA) capabilities and scientific opportunities that will soon be 
available to the community. 

Specific focus areas for this workshop will include: 
    The Atomic Universe: Atomic Spectra as Probes of Cool Gas 
    The Molecular Universe: Dense Star-forming Gas 
    Isotopic Variety in Interstellar Medium 
    Our Molecular Origins: Prebiotic Molecules 

Attendees arriving on 14 January are invited to attend a panel discussion on 
ALMA Development. An optional tour of the Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics 
and demonstrations of ALMA observing and data reduction software will be 
offered on 17 January following the workshop. 

Please pre-register to receive future e-mail announcements about this ALMA 
workshop and to submit your final registration. The brief pre-registration 
form and additional information are available at 

   http://www.almatelescope.ca/Spectroscopy2011/ 

Given the venue size, meeting attendance will be limited to about 100 
participants on a first-come, first-served basis once full registration 
opens on 1 September 2010. 

We sincerely hope you will consider attending this workshop and join the 
community in realizing the full potential of ALMA!
