Dear All,

We will have a colloquium talk tomorrow.

Usually I would refuse to allocate three talks in a week, but this is  
a talk
that I cannot refuse.  We usually only have talks that interest people
above the 11th floor.  The talk tomorrow is suitable for the whole  
institute.

Please mark your calendar.

Cheers,
Wei-Hao

Dear Yi-Jehng,

This one may be worth circulated via TAN, if it's not done yet.

best,

> Applications are invited for the 2010 CARMA Summer School.
>
> We are planning to hold the CARMA SUMMER SCHOOL at the CARMA site in  
> the
> Inyo mountains during the week July 11 - 17, 2010.
>
> Students will stay at the observatory for lectures, practical
> demonstrations, and observing projects.  The lectures cover the basic
> theory of interferometer observations, data reduction and imaging.
> During the school each participant will make observations, and analyze
> the results.
>
> - There will be a nominal cost to the students.
> - Positions will be extremely limited.
> - Participants should normally be graduate students or postdocs.
> - The application deadline is April 25.
> - The application should consist of a statement of up to one page  
> saying
> why the student would like to come, and contain the name and contact
> information for the student's advisor.
>
> Here are some of the instrumental characteristics to help select a
> suitable project to learn observing and data analysis techniques.
>
> CARMA is designed as an aperture synthesis telescope. There are two
> receiver bands: 3 mm and 1 mm. A basic aperture synthesis observation
> makes an image the size of the primary beam (lambda/diameter ~1 arcmin
> at 100 GHz; 0.5 arcmin at 230 GHz) with a resolution corresponding to
> the maximum separations of the 15 antennas. You will learn how this
> works at the school. During the school we will be in a compact antenna
> configuration, the D-configuration, which gives an angular resolution
> ~3-6 at 100 GHz, and 1.5-3 arcsec at 230 GHz, or the most compact
> E-configuration with an angular resolution ~10 arcsec at 100 GHz, and
> ~4-5 arcsec at 230 GHz.
>
> The most convenient source size is one which is smaller than the  
> size of
> the primary beam. Larger sources can be imaged by time-sharing the
> pointing of the antennas (mosaicing), at the cost of lowered
> sensitivity. The sensitivity is determined by the system noise
> (receivers plus atmosphere), the bandwidth (or velocity resolution),  
> and
> the observing time. The atmosphere is usually not so good for 1 mm
> observations in the summer, or for sources which are at low  
> declinations
> and must be observed through more of the atmosphere, so it's best to
> select a bright source which is high in the sky and can be observed  
> at 3
> mm, but don't be discouraged if your favorite source does not satisfy
> all these conditions. It's best to observe a strong enough source that
> you can make an image during the school, rather than a detection
> project. Then you can see the effects of different imaging techniques.
>
> You can read a TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION:
> http://cedarflat.mmarray.org/observing/doc/instrument_desc.html
> There is a tool to calculate the RMS noise:
> http://cedarflat.mmarray.org/observing/tools/rms.html
> and a tool to explore correlator configurations:
> http://cedarflat.mmarray.org/observing/tools/CGS.html
>
> LOGISTICS
>
> Travel:
> Plan to arrive on Sunday 11 July and depart on Saturday 17 or
> Sunday 18 July. We will organize a hike in the Sierras on Saturday.
> The school starts at 9am Monday and ends Saturday.
>
> Meals:
> Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner will be provided and will be cooked
> communally in the control room kitchen.
>
> Accommodations:
> Because this is a 'hands-on' school, the plan is to hold all lectures
> and demonstrations in the control building at Cedar Flat, adjacent to
> the telescopes.  Since the dorm and cottage at OVRO can accommodate at
> most 8, we hope that at least 7 people will join Mel and Dick in  
> camping
> out at the "Nelson" campground, about 1.5 miles from the control room.
> Those who camp will avoid the hassle of driving up and down the  
> mountain
> each day, and will have a wonderful opportunity to star-gaze each  
> night.
>
> Cost:
> The fees for the school, including accommodation and food will range
> from $25.00 to $65.00 per person per day, depending on accommodation
> choice.
>
> PLEASE REPLY WITH YOUR APPLICATION BY 25 APRIL.
>
> Applications should be sent to Mary Daniel <mary@ovro.caltech.edu>.
>
> Persons affiliated with the CARMA institutions who are interested in
> attending should contact their local director. Students from outside
> the CARMA institutions should contact Melvyn Wright
> <wright@astron.berkeley.edu> for more information.
