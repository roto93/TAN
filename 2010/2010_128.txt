Arizona Radio Observatory: Call for Proposals (Spring 2010)
------------------------------------------------------------

Dear all,

UCAT-ASIAA's ARO proposals deadline for the 2010 fall semester
(October 15, 2010 - February 1, 2011) is set on September 26, 2010 (Sunday).

The Arizona Radio Observatory operates the Sub-Millimeter Telescope (SMT)
and the Kitt Peak 12 Meter (12m). The SMT currently supports a
dual-polarization, ALMA Band-6 1 mm receiver, a dual-polarization 0.8 mm
receiver, and an ALMA Band-9 (602-720 GHz) dual-polarization receiver.
The SMT control system has been updated to allow for dual polarization,
dual sideband observations (so-called "4 IF mode").  The 12m supports 2 mm
and 3 mm (65-176 GHz) dual-polarization receivers.  A new ALMA Band-3 receiver
is now available at the 12 m for the 85-116 GHz band (3 mm HI), also
dual-polarization. Remote observing is available at both ARO telescopes.

Please refer to http://aro.as.arizona.edu/ for more details.

Information about Remote Observing can be viewed at:
http://aro.as.arizona.edu/remote/remote.htm.

For further information about remote observing and other operational
questions, please contact Tom Folkers, Operations Manager:
tfolkers@as.arizona.edu.

People are required to use the 12m and SMT proposal cover/summary
sheets for their proposals:
(obtainable under "Proposal Submission Information" at
  http://aro.as.arizona.edu/proposal_submission_information.htm
for the SMT -
  http://aro.as.arizona.edu/proposals/smt_prop_sub.htm
and for the 12m -
  http://aro.as.arizona.edu/proposals/12m_prop_sub.htm )

Proposals should consist of a proposal Cover Sheet, obtainable at
  http://aro.as.arizona.edu/proposals/ ,
and a brief scientific and technical justification. The justification
may be up to two pages of text, and should NOT exceed three pages in
total including tables, figures, references and a source list with observing
time requirements. For electronic submission, UCAT-ASIAA only accepts
proposals in either PS/EPS or PDF formats.

Please submit your proposals by midnight (23:59 pm CST) September 26, 2010
to kuan @ asiaa.sinica.edu.tw .

Kind regards,
Yi-Jehng Kuan
on behalf of the UCAT-ASIAA ARO TAC
