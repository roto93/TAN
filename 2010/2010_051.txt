Dear Yi-Jehng

In case you do not have this already...something worth circulating for
students.

Hello,

The Max Planck Institut fuer Radioastronomie would like to announce
the opening of registration for the use of single-dish telescopes for
centimeter-wave radio astronomy.  My apologies if you receive this
e-mail more than once.

European Single-Dish School in the Era of Arrays

MPIfR, Bonn
2010 September 27--October 01


First Announcement

The Max Planck Institute fuer Radioastromie (MPIfR) is organizing a
school on single-dish radio astronomy.  The school will be held in
2010 from Monday, September 27 through Friday, October 01 at the MPIfR
in Bonn, Germany.  The school is intended to train graduate students
and astronomers from other fields in the fundamental techniques and
applications of single-dish, centimeter- and longer-wavelength radio
astronomy, including hands-on experience in acquiring and processing
data from current single-dish European telescopes.

The school will begin with a series of lectures by current experts in
the basic fundamentals of single-dish radio astronomy and its
relationship to other radio astronomical techniques, using single
dishes for current science applications, and data processing
environments of modern single-dish radio astronomy.  The students will
then partake in actual observing sessions at the Effelsberg 100 m
telescope and realtime remote observing sessions with telescopes at
Jodrell Bank and LOFAR stations.  They will then analyze their data
and present the results of their work.  A lecture on effective
proposal writing will be given, and the students will have the
opportunity to write test observing proposals for the Effelsberg 100 m
telescope, and receive feedback from experts on their proposals.


The school will be limited to approximately 50 students.  Students are
encouraged to register early, as the school will operate on a
first-come, first-served basis.  A registration fee of 150 euros will
cover lunches during the school (including a bar-b-que at Effelsberg),
bus travel to Effelsberg for observations, coffee breaks, and the
school banquet dinner.  Students are expected to cover the cost of
travel to Bonn, lodging, and other meals.  Participants who register
for lodging through the school website will receive a voucher for free
public transportation within Bonn for the length of their stay.
Limited financial assistance, including some RadioNet support, will be
available.  Students requiring financial assistance should indicate
this on their registration form.  Application forms for financial
assistance will be sent to the students at a later date.

Important dates:
    2010 Mar 29:  Registration opens.
    2010 Jun 01:  Application deadline for financial assistance.
    2010 Aug 20:  Registration closes.
    2010 Aug 27:  Hotel booking deadline.
    2010 Sep 27:  School begins.
