Subject: PhD positions in the Netherlands
   
Dear Colleague, 

More than 20 PhD positions will be available in astronomy in the 
coming year in the context of the Netherlands Research School for 
Astronomy (NOVA). NOVA is a federation of the astronomical institutes of 
the universities of Amsterdam, Groningen, Leiden, Nijmegen and 
Utrecht.  Topics include the formation and evolution of galaxies, the 
formation of stars and planetary systems, exo-planets, the 
astrophysics of compact objects, astroparticle physics, astronomical 
instrumentation and laboratory astrophysics.  Astronomers in the 
Netherlands have access to state-of-the-art telescopes and space 
observatories around the world. 

The Netherlands has an internationally acknowledged reputation for 
research and education in astronomy.  The PhD program is 4 yr, during 
which the PhD students are appointed as civil servants and earn a 
competitive salary. Individual projects can be found through 
www.nova-astronomy.nl/application. Deadlines vary per project and 
institute but can be as early as December 15 2010.  A Masters degree (or 
equivalent) in astronomy or a related field is required. 

Can you please distribute this information to suitable candidates? 

Thank you in advance, 

Sincerely, 

Prof. dr. E.F. van Dishoeck 
Scientific Director, NOVA
