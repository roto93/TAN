Leiden Observatory invites applications for  PhD positions 

We are pleased to announce a general call for 5-10 PhD positions with an 
application deadline of December 17, 2010. Application forms and 
instructions are available at http://www.strw.leidenuniv.nl/phd/ 

Applicants are requested to upload a curriculum vitae, a list of 
all university courses taken and transcripts of grades obtained, brief 
statements of research interests and experience, and the contact 
information for at least two referees. 

Leiden Observatory, founded in 1633, is the oldest university astronomy 
department in the world. With about 25 faculty, over 30 postdoctoral 
associates and over 40 PhD students it is the largest astronomy department 
in the Netherlands. Leiden is a charming university town with 
international flair. Most Leiden researchers have an international 
background. English is the common language. 

The four-year PhD program consists mostly of research under the 
supervision of one or more faculty members. Positions are available in all 
the research areas in which the Observatory is active. These include 
cosmology, galaxy formation and evolution, interstellar matter and star 
formation, stars and planetary systems, computational astrophysics, high 
energy astrophysics, laboratory astrophysics, astrochemistry, and 
instrumentation. More information about research at Leiden Observatory can 
be found at 
http://www.strw.leidenuniv.nl/research/ 

During their thesis, Leiden PhD students are paid as civil servants, which 
means that they earn competitive salaries (the current gross salary, 
including allowances, increases from about EUR 28,000 in year 1 to about 
EUR 36,000 in year 4) and are eligible for both social security and 
retirement benefits. PhD positions are funded for four years. 

The successful candidates must have a MSc degree (or equivalent) by the 
starting date. The starting dates are negotiable. 

Complete applications received by December 17, 2010 will receive full 
consideration. 

The positions are open to candidates from all countries. The research will 
be carried out in the framework of the Netherlands Research School for 
Astronomy (NOVA). More information about the PhD program at Leiden 
Observatory can be found at http://www.strw.leidenuniv.nl/phd/
