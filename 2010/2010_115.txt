CPS 7th International School of Planetary Sciences
Date: 10 &#65533; 15 January 2011
Venue: Seapal Suma, a casual seaside resort located in the west part of
Kobe, Japan
Address: 1-1-1 Sumaura-dori, Suma, Kobe 654-0055 Japan

Objective and Scope:
The objective of CPS International School of Planetary Sciences is to
promote education and research in planetary sciences for highly
motivated graduate students and young

researchers worldwide. It will offer them an opportunity to interact
with leading scientists in a specific field of the year. Note that
&#31109;lanetary Sciences&#65533; includes astronomy (astrophysics,
astrochemistry, astrobiology, etc.), geosciences, space science, and
other related fields.

Topic of the coming school
Theory of Stellar Evolution and Its Applications &#65533; from the First Stars
to Planet-Hosting Stars and Gas Giant Planets

The main part of the school will be a series of lectures on the
structure and evolution of stars with various masses including gas giant
planets and on the effects of mass loss and stellar

rotation upon them. Then a series of lectures follow on their
contributions to the nucleosynthesis and chemical evolution of the Milky
Way and dwarf galaxies in the local group and to the

evolutionary characteristics of planet-hosting stars from theoretical
and observational viewpoints.
The development of our understandings in these fields has been achieved
by recent observations with large ground-based telescopes and space
telescopes and owing to large-scaled

surveys of metal-poor stars, supernova searches and searches for
exo-planetary systems.

CPS 7th International School has a special session dedicated to the
memory of Prof. Chushiro Hayashi who was one of the founders of the
theory of stellar evolution and passed away in

2010.

Internationally well-established experts in various fields will review
recent progress in our understandings of those fields. The lecturers and
their topics are listed below:

Daiichiro Sugimoto  (The University of Tokyo, Japan)
       ---Why the Stars and the Universe evolve? --- Fundamentals of Stellar
Structure and Evolution and Their Gravothermal Natures

Peter R. Wood  (Australian National University, Australia)
       ---Evolution and Mass Loss of Low- and Intermediate-Mass Stars

Georges Meynet  (University of Geneva, Switzerland)
       ---Evolution of Massive Stars and the Effects of Rotation

Stanley P. Owocki (University of Delaware, USA)
       ---Mass Loss from Massive Stars

Alexander Heger (University of Minnesota, USA)
       ---Explosive Nucleosynthesis

Martin Asplund (Max-Planck-Institut f&#27072; Astrophysik, Germany)
       ---Solar Abundances, Solar Twins, and Planet Harboring Stars

Arlette Noels (Universit&#65533; de LiéŠ¶e, Belgium),
       ---Seismology and Oscillations of Stars

Jonathan J. Fortney (University of California, Santa Cruz, USA)
       ---Structure and Evolution of Gas Giant Planets

Andrea Ferrara (Scuola Normale Superiore, Italy)
       ---Star Formation in the Early Universe and the Transition from
Population III to Populations II and I

Eline Tolstoy (University of Groningen, The Netherlands)
       ---Chemical Evolution of the Milky Way and Local Group Galaxies
