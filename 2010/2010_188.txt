Subject: SPICA Science Meeting: Kick-off Discussion (Dec. 7)

Dear TAN colleagues,

Some of us are trying to organize collaboration between Taiwan and SPICA
(Space Infrared Telescope for Cosmology and Astrophysics).
SPICA is a proposed space telescope mission lead by Japan and Europe,
equipped with a single 3-m aperture cooled (~5 K) space telescope.
This mission will allow a mould breaking step forward in detection sensitivity
in the 5 to 200 Î¼m waveband which will revolutionize our understanding of
how galaxies, stars and planets form and interaction between the interlinked
astrophysical processes that have ultimately led to the formation of our own
Solar system and the emergence of life on Earth. If the project is fully funded and
everything goes well, the telescope will be launched in 2018.

We will organize a kick-off discussion about our possible science collaboration
on December 7, 15:30- at ASIAA (Room 1108 on 11F). The meeting would take
about 1 or 1.5 hours, including:-

(1) Explanation for the following:-
     - Overview of the SPICA project
     - Discussions between ASIAA and JAXA to date
     - Key science projects proposed by the Japanese community

(2) Discussion about the following:-
     - if the instrumental specification matches your research interests
     - what kind of contributions you or your university could make
       for the SPICA project (science documentation, software development, funding etc.)

If you are interested in attending, please e-mail to Youichi (ohyama@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw) by December 3. Arrangement of the TV/SKYPE meeting system would also be possible. Send your remote connection request/questions to Youichi.

Best regards,
 Shiang-Yu Wang, Youichi Ohyama, Hiro Takami (ASIAA)
