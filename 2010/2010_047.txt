Subject: [Colloquium] Colloquium talk tomorrow
Date: Tue, 30 Mar 2010 17:18:04 +0800

Dear All,

We will have a colloquium talk tomorrow.

Usually I would refuse to allocate three talks in a week, but this is  
a talk
that I cannot refuse.  We usually only have talks that interest people
above the 11th floor.  The talk tomorrow is suitable for the whole  
institute.

Please mark your calendar.

Cheers,
Wei-Hao
