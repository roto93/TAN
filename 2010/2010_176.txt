Dear Yi-Jehng,

   Please circulate the following annoucement in TAN.

Thanks,

----------------------------------------------------------------
                    ALMA User Workshop
      Early 2010 (probably in Feb, to be announced in the 2nd announcement)

    Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Academia Sinica

Announcement

The Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics at Academia Sinica (ASIAA)
announces its second workshop for Taiwanese ALMA users. The workshop is
oriented for all astronomers, regardless of specialty.

The ALMA observatory is in construction at the present, with 8 antennas
already at the Array Operations Site (AOS). The first call for proposals
will be issued soon, either at the end of 2010 or in the beginning of 2011,
for the Early Science (ES). This ALMA workshop will provide users with the
tools to prepare, submit, and track their scientific proposals. Additional
workshop(s) will be organized later for the observing preparation and data
reduction, once the users are required to provide the detailed information
for the execution of the observations.

The organizing committee encourages all the Taiwanese astronomers and
scholars interested in observing with ALMA to take part in this workshop.
For students coming from outside Taipei City/County can apply for travel
support from ASIAA for the transportation and accommodation, and this
support is sponsored by tuCASA (http://www.es.ntnu.edu.tw/tuCASA/). Due to
limited space and the hands-on nature of this workshop, participation will
be limited to 80 people.

The program of the workshop will include:
(1) Fundamentals of (sub)millimeter interferometry (very briefly)
(2) ALMA capabilities in Early Science and Full Operation phases
(3) Observing with ALMA and user supports from ARCs, Taiwan-ARC node, & tuCASA
(4) ALMA softwares for preparing, submitting, and tracking proposals:
     User Portal, Help-Desk, Observing Tool, Splatalogue
(5) CASA SIMDATA imaging simulation for observation planning
(6) Hands-on exercise on proposal preparation and submission
(7) Contributed proposal talks in Design Reference Science Plan (DSRP)
     (http://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/alma/science/drsp/)
     format or even in a ready format.

Actions:
1. For the participants with less experience in Radio Interferometry, please
    attend the ALMA Novice-User Workshop 2010
    (http://www.es.ntnu.edu.tw/tuCASA/novice-wksp/) in advance.
2. Each participant should have browsed through the presentation files in our
    first ALMA user workshop (http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/act/workshop/20100208/program.php)
3. Each participant should have read the ALMA Primer
    (http://alma.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/taw2/ALMAPrimer2.pdf)
    and looked through the Science Web pages
    (http://alma.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/science.php)
4. Everyone who is coming to the workshop should try preparing their
    own favorite proposal BEFORE coming to the workshop.
5. Each participant is encouraged to have worked through a ES SIMDATA example
    (to be provided later)
