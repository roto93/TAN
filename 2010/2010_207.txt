*********************************************************************** 
*             2011 European Radio Interferometry School               * 
*********************************************************************** 

We are happy to announce that the Fourth European Radio Interferometry 
School will take place in Rimini (Italy), in the week 

                       5 - 9 September 2011 

ERIS will provide a week of lectures and tutorials on how to get 
scientific results from radio interferometry.  Topics covered 
include: 
* Calibration and imaging continuum, spectral line and polarization data 
* Extracting the information and interpreting the results 
* Specific features for VLBI, high frequency (ALMA domain) and low 
frequency observations (LOFAR domain) 
* Choosing the most suited array and observing plan for your project. 

Participants are expected to bring their own laptops, equipped with 
the most widely-used packages such as AIPS, CASA and Parseltongue. 
Most examples will be drawn from cm-wave instruments such as VLA, EVN 
and MERLIN but experts for arrays from LOFAR to ALMA will be available. 

The school will be held at the Sporting Hotel, where the participants 
and lecturers will also be accomodated. 
See the hotel web page at http://www.hotelsportingrimini.com/ 

A registration fee of 150 Euro is requested, which will cover the 
accomodation and half board for the 5 days of the school, from 
the arrival on 5 September 2011 to the departure on 10 September 2011. 
Participants will be accomodated in double and triple rooms. 

Please reply to this email, eris2011@ira.inaf.it, indicating your 
interest to be notified of future announcements. 

Forms for registration and hotel booking and further instructions will 
soon be made available. Note that due to logistical limitations 
we will be able to accomodate around 80 participants, so we encourage 
to send your interest and register as soon as possible.

                                         December 14, 2010
Dear Colleagues:

     I apologize that the pace for the organization of the 2nd APcosPA 
Winter School/Workshop is somewhat slow - but in a good progress. At this 
point, we again anticipate that there are about 10 "students" (senoir 
graduate students, young postdocs, etc.) from China (Beida, Jao-Tung, 
etc.), more than 6 from South Korea, a few from Japan, and so on. The 
domestic participation is limited to about 40. We would like to choose, at 
the end of the program, a few "students" for awards. This message is 
intended so that you would encourage your best "students" to participate 
this competition, with the deadline to register as 7 January 2011.
 
     Merry Christmas and Happy New Year !!     

     Best wishes, W-Y. Pauchy Hwang
                  President, APCosPA Org

> Dear Colleagues:
  
       The pace of the advancement in the area of Cosmology and Particle 
  Astrophysics (CosPA) is amazedly fast since the new century. The 
  researchers in the Asia Pacific region, including Australia, China, 
  Japan, Korea, Taiwan, etc., have played their due roles in making the 
  progresses. To make our marks more noticeable, we are forming the Asia 
  Pacific Organization for Cosmology and Particle Astrophysics (APCosPA 
  Org), starting from nothing but hopefully growing eventually into 
  something fairly visible.
  
       One beginning is to hold the First APCosPA Winter School, 18-29 
  January 2010, at National Taiwan University, Taipei, and now the Second 
  APCosPA Winter School/Workshop, January 17-28, also at NTU, Taipei. We 
  will try to cover the various topics in Cosmology and Particle 
  Astrophysics but mainly toward the graduate students and young 
  researchers. The anticipated lecturers (except the workshop period) 
  include:
 
       Chia-Hung Vincent Chang (NTNU, Taiwan)
       Pisin Chen (NTU, Taiwan)
       Kiwoon Choi (KAIST, Korea)
       Bruce Dawson (Adelaide, Australia)
       Xiao-Gang He (NTU, Taiwan) 
       Stephen D.H. Hsu (Oregon, USA)
       Sang Pyo Kim (Kunsan, Korea)
       Hyun Kyu Lee (Hanyang Univ, Korea)
       Miao Li (ITP, Beijing)
       Bo-Qiang Ma (Beida, Beijing)
       Jen-Chieh Peng (UIUC, USA)
       Alexei Starobinsky (Laudau Inst, Russia)
       Bin Wang (SJTU, China)
       David Wiltshire (Canterbury Univ, NZ)
       Anthony Zee (UCSB, USA) 
> 
  Each will give two or three lectures, with a couple of hard problems. 
  The registered students or young postdocs could enter the competitions 
  with the awards given to the first few "students".
