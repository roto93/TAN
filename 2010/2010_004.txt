Hi Yi-Jehng

Please circulate this via TAN; thanks.

Wen Ping

Dear Colleagues

A forum was originally planned right after the Physics Society meeting at 
NCKU in early February.  The subject of the discussion, as you probably 
recall, is how to promote the research activity in Taiwan by consolidating 
resources.  The feedback I have gotten is that not most are going to the 
PSROC meeting, and it does not make sense to make a special trip.

So the forum is put off to a TBA status, most likely to take place in the 
spring in northren part of the island.  If you already schedule to attend, 
my apology.

Regards,

Wen Ping

Dear Colleagues,

As you see below, The Asia-Pacific Radio Science Conference (AP-RASC) will be
held in Toyama, Japan. AP-RASC is the Asia-Pacific regional URSI conference
held between the URSI General Assemblies. At the conference, COMMISSION J
(Radio astronomy) will hold a session "Millimeter- and sub-millimeter-wave
telescope and array". In this session, science carried by millimeter and
submillimeter telescopes and arrays, such as ALMA, SMA, ASTE, Nobeyama 45m,
submm-VLBI etc., will be discussed. Future plans for millimeter and 
submillimeter telescopes and arrays will also be discussed. You can find more
details at

http://www.ap-rasc10.jp/

or just ask me. The deadline of the abstract is March 31, 2010. 


Cheers,
Nagayoshi
