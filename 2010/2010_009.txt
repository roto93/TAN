Location: Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Academia Sinica
         (Taida Campus)
Time: May 28 - 30, 2010

The 2010 Scientific Assembly of the Astronomical Society of Republic of China
(ASROC2010) will be held at Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Academia
Sinica (ASIAA) on May 28 - 30, 2010. This is the annual event for all
astronomers and astrophysicists in Taiwan to demonstrate their most recent
discoveries and observations, to report their latest research results and to
exchange ideas, also to organize cooperation when desirable. Oral presentations
and conference posters in all areas of astronomy and astrophysics are solicited.
ASROC2010 is an excellent venue, too, for students, in particular graduate
students, to present their research finding or progress from their thesis
studies.

The meeting will include plenary talks, scientific sessions, poster
presentation, a business meeting, and an educational symposium. The plenary
talks feature (1) Prof. Paul Ho, Director of Astronomy and Astrophysics,
Academia Sinica and (2) Prof Wei-Hsin Sun, Graduate Institute of Astrophysics,
National Taiwan University.

ASROC2010 website will be ready by mid-March, and on-line registration will be
available from March 22, 2010. Participants of the scientific assembly should
submit their abstracts and register on-line by April 30, 2010. A registration
fee of NT$500 should be paid on site. In addition, beginning from this year,
the contributions in the ASROC meeting, including oral talks and poster
presentations will be published in the Journal of Taipei Astronomical Museum.
Details about the page limits and format of the papers will be described in the
second circular and the website of the Astronomical Society.

The Astronomical Society cordially invites you to participate in this annual
event with all the many interesting and exciting activities. For more details
and updated information, please visit the ASROC website at

Announcement 

The Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics at Academia Sinica (ASIAA) is 
pleased to host the first user workshop for local ALMA users in Taiwan. 

This workshop aims to provide practical information on how to plan, propose, 
reduce, and analyze ALMA observations. Assuming that the participants know 
about radio astronomy and interferometry, we will NOT cover those topics in 
this workshop. Brand new users will have to attend further radio 
astronomy/interferometry schools or classes. 

Due to limited space and the hands-on nature of this workshop, participation 
will be limited to 50 people. Upon registration, students outside the Taipei 
City/County can apply for travel support (including transportation and 
accommodation) from ASIAA, if they do not have any support from their 
supervisor or university. 

Workshop Goals: 
1. To prepare Taiwanese astronomers for observations with ALMA. 
2. To provide an update on the full and early science capabilities of ALMA. 
3. To provide practical information on how to plan and execute ALMA 
   observations 
4. To discuss Taiwanese ALMA science projects & foster collaborations. 
5. To introduce the Observing Tool (OT) and the ALMA data reduction 
   software (CASA), and provide hands-on demonstrations of their use.
