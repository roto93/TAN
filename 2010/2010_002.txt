Subject: Forum on Feb 5 put off

Hi Yi-Jehng

Please circulate this via TAN; thanks.

Dear Colleagues

A forum was originally planned right after the Physics Society meeting at
NCKU in early February.  The subject of the discussion, as you probably
recall, is how to promote the research activity in Taiwan by consolidating
resources.  The feedback I have gotten is that not most are going to the
PSROC meeting, and it does not make sense to make a special trip.

So the forum is put off to a TBA status, most likely to take place in the
spring in northren part of the island.  If you already schedule to attend,
my apology.

Regards,

Wen Ping
