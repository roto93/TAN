First Announcement, First International Symposium for Science with the SOAR Telescope
The Southern Astrophysical Research (SOAR) Telescope is a 4.1 meter aperture telescope designed to produce the best quality images of any observatory in its class in the world. It was funded by a partnership between the U.S. National Optical Astronomy Observatory (NOAO), The Ministerio da Ciencia e Tecnologia do Brasil, Michigan State University (MSU) and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC).

After five years of continuing science operations with the SOAR telescope, the First International Symposium of Science with SOAR will bring together specialists, graduate students, and post-docs from the different partners with expertise in a wide variety of scientific areas, who will highlight key results gathered from observations with SOAR and/or outline promising science programs for the future.

The Symposium is also an opportunity to discuss current instrument performance and future instrumentation to SOAR as well as to share common experience in the reduction and analysis of data with SOAR.

The Symposium will take place at the resort area of Maresias Beach, on the Atlantic coast of Sao Paulo, Brazil, on May 15-19, 2011. There will be a number of invited speakers, together with ample time for contributed (oral) papers, posters, and discussion.

Please see the symposium web site for more information and to register: http://www.lna.br/FISSS2011/
