Dear Colleagues, 

As the call for Early Science proposals with ALMA is approaching, we at the 
North American ALMA Science Center at the NRAO and the HIA 
(http://science.nrao.edu/alma/) invite you to attend a one-day ALMA tutorial 
that will include: 

     - ALMA Early Science capabilities 

     - The services provided by the North American ALMA Science Center 

     - How to use the ALMA Observing Tool (OT) and submit a proposal 

     - How to simulate an early science observation using the SIMDATA 
       package in CASA (the data reduction package for ALMA). 

The tutorial will take place directly AFTER the Spectroscopy2011 Conference 
(http://www.almatelescope.ca/Spectroscopy2011) on Tuesday, January 18, 2011 
in Victoria, Canada at a cost of $100 per participant to cover the tutorial 
room, equipment, and refreshments. As the goal is hands-on experience with 
the OT and SIMDATA which use CASA, participants will need to bring their 
own laptop and install (and verify they work) these packages before they 
arrive. The NAASC department at the NRAO helpdesk (http://my.nrao.edu) is 
available to address questions about installation etc., and more information 
about installing these packages will be forthcoming to registered 
participants of the tutorial. 

As venue space is limited for this event, we can only offer about 60 spaces 
so please register ASAP to reserve your place in the tutorial. 

Registration for this event is available at: 

    http://science.nrao.edu/alma/spec11/regist_tutorial.shtml 

The tutorial registration will remain open until November 30, 2010 or until 
we reach the maximum number of participants. 

Thank you for your interest and helping us to realize the full potential of 
ALMA for the community! 

Sincerely, 

Anthony Remijan
