Dear colleagues, 

     Next week from June 8th to June 12th, the International Conference 
 "Millimeter and Submillimeter Astronomy at High Angular Resolution"   
will be held at Academia Sinica in Nankang, Taipei. 

     The meeting aims to review the latest scientific findings by   
millimeter and submillimeter observations at high angular resolution, and to   
outline the road map towards the ALMA era. There have been over 200 people   
registered for the conference, including more than 2/3 of the participants
coming from overseas. Additional details about the conference can be found
at our website 

     "http://www2.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/taipei09/" 

     We would like to encourage more participation from on-island colleagues 
to join the meeting, interact with colleagues from other countries, and/or 
present your research (formally or informally). 

     On-site registration is available at the conference site for 
 participants who also would like to enjoy the full conference package, 
 including the handout material, lunches, Tuesday banquet, and the souvenir. 
 A discounted registration fee of NTD 1000 will be charged, but can be waived 
 for on-island colleagues with (oral/poster) presentations. Spaces are 
 available for add-on poster presentations on-site. 

     Thanks for your attention, and please send your inquiry to 
 "taipei09loc@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw", if you have any further questions. 

best regards, 
sheng-yuan (on behalf of the LOC)
