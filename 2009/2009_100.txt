Dear all:

  Here is the abstract for the talk of Jean-Charles. He will show a 
spectacular movie he made based on the wide field images.

The summit of Mauna Kea (14,000 feet) offers the best viewing of the 
Cosmos in the northern hemisphere, and the film "Hawaiian Starlight" 
delivers a pure esthetic experience from the mountain into the Universe. 
Seven years in the making, this cinematic symphony reveals the 
spectacular beauty of the mountain and its connection to the Cosmos 
through the magical influence of time-lapse cinematography scored 
exclusively (no narration) with the awe-inspiring, critically 
acclaimed, Halo music by Martin O'Donnell and Michael Salvatori. 
Daytime and nighttime landscapes and skyscapes alternate with 
stunning true color images of the Universe captured by an 
observatory on Mauna Kea, all free of any computer generated 
imagery. The inspiration and technology of the film for both the 
terrestrial cinematography and astronomical imagery using CFHT's 
large optical CCD mosaics  will be presented. 

best,
Shiang-Yu
