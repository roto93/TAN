America, Europe, and Japan in cooperation with the Republic of Chile.
It is currently under construction in the Chajnantor area in the Atacama
desert in northern Chile. ALMA will be studying a broad range of exciting
science, such as weather
  patterns on solar system planets, the formation of planets and stars  
in our
  galaxy, the motions within active galactic nuclei, and the formation  
of the
  earliest galaxies at z~10. Taiwan has collaborations with both the  
ALMA-Japan

participating
  various construction activities. You can find some more information
