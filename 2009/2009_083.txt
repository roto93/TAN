Announcement of ADASS 2009 SAPPORO

We are pleased to announce the opening of registration for the
19th annual conference on Astronomical Data Analysis Software
and Systems (ADASS).  The conference will be held in Sapporo,
Japan at the Renaissance Sapporo Hotel during 4-8 October
2009.

The ADASS conference is held each year at a different hosting
astronomical institution. The conference provides a forum for
scientists and programmers concerned with algorithms, software
and software systems employed in the acquisition, reduction,
analysis, and dissemination of astronomical data.  The program
includes invited talks, contributed papers, display sessions,
tutorials, and computer demonstrations, as well as special
interest ("Birds of a Feather" or BOF) meetings.  These
activities aim to encourage communication between software
specialists, scientists, and also to stimulate further development
of astronomical software and systems.  We encourage you to
participate in this exciting conference by submitting an oral or
poster abstract, a demonstration, or a BoF proposal.

Key topics for this year's conference include but are not
limited to:

* Time domain astronomy
* "Most dangerous" process, design & implementation errors
* Virtual Astronomical Observatory (VAO) and the Virtual Obsevatory
* Reusable archive technologies
* Commonly available development environments & tools

As this is the first ADASS in Asia, we encourage proposals that
deal with topics of special interest to Asia.

Details on the submission process can be found on the Conference
website at http://www.adass.org/.
