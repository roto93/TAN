============================================================================== 

In this issue (Feb 25 - Mar 01, 2009) 

1. A message from the administrator
2. A message for NCU subscribers
3. CFHT Semester 2009B now open for proposals

============================================================================== 

Dear TAN subscribers,

Because the main server machine of TAN at ASIAA crashed sometime last week
(Feb 26-27), we will be using the TAN backup host machine at Shida
(castor.scc.ntnu.edu.tw) from now on until the server at ASIAA is fixed.
And messages sent to TAN during this time (Feb 26 - Mar 01) may have lost.
However, this may take a while to resolve the problem.  By the mean time,
submission of news or annuncement to TAN can still be sent to
astro@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw as before.

Sorry for any inconvenience may have caused.

Yi-Jehng Kuan

Dear NCU subscribers,

*** Proposals for CFHT open for semester 2009B *** 

 The 3.6 meter optical/infrared Canadian-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) is 
now open for proposals from all Taiwan-based researchers for semester 2009B. 
The deadline for proposal submission is: 

      26 March 2009 - 8:00 am Taiwan time 

We anticipate that a minimum of 5 nights, and possibly up to 10 nights, will 
be available in semester 2009B, depending on demand and quality of proposals. 
Please note that the instruments available for 2009B are MegaCam, WIRCam, 
ESPaDOnS, GriF, and PUEO.  Grif may not be as competitive as integral field 
units on other telescopes, and so proposals that require this instrument would 
need to be particularly compelling.  Detailed information on the telescope, 
available instrumentation, proposal format, and how to submit proposals is 
available from the CFHT web page: 

   http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/ObsInfo/ObservingProposals/ 

Exploratory Programs 
-------------------- 
To encourage innovative science, this semester we will continue considering 
"exploratory" programs using MegaCam, WIRCam, or ESPaDOnS that require no more 
than 1 hour of observing time.  Such proposals will not be refereed, but will 
be scrutinized by the TAC and allocated time based on scientific merit and 
feasibility.  When submitting such proposals, please state at the beginning of 
the scientific justification that "This is an EXPLORATORY proposal". 

Queued Service Observations Snapshot Programs 
--------------------------------------------- 
In addition, we would like to bring to your attention the Queued Service 
Observation (QSO) snapshot program.  These are programs that can be executed 
with either MegaCam or WIRCam in relatively poor seeing conditions when the 
seeing is >1.2". Projects executed under the QSO snapshot program are not 
charged to the available observing time for Taiwan.  Proposals to the QSO 
snapshot program will not be refereed, but will be scrutinized by the TAC for 
scientific value and feasibility. More information on this program can be 
found at: 

   http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/Instruments/Queue/qso_2007b_MP.html 

Resubmission due to Lost Time 
----------------------------- 
If your scheduled project from previous semesters was not completed for any 
reason (including bad weather), you will need to resubmit your proposal 
explaining why you need more time.  Your proposal will be stronger if the 
available data has been analyzed, and you use this data to demonstrate that 
the stated science goals can be achieved with allocation of the full requested 
time. 

Time Allocation Process 
----------------------- 
All new proposals, and where deemed necessary resubmitted proposals, are 
refereed by researchers selected by the Taiwan-CFHT TAC based on their 
demonstrated expertise in the relevant research fields.  Apart from the 
referees comments, who are asked to evaluate primarily the scientific strength 
of the proposal, the Taiwan-CFHT TAC also takes into account technical 
feasibility.  For those who have previously been scheduled observing time on 
the CFHT, the Taiwan-CFHT TAC will also take into account the status of 
previously executed projects and publications. 

Status of Previous Proposals 
---------------------------- 
Please fill in or update the status of all your previous projects on the web page 

https://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/Internal/WIRcamData/ListStatus.php 

(New University users will be contacted on how to access this web page.) 
You can and should provide more details on the progress of previous 
(especially related) projects in the relevant section of your proposal. If no 
information is forthcoming, the TAC will assume that no progress has been made 
and will take this into consideration in allocation of observing time.
