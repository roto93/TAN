Dear Yi-Jehng,

Would you please distribute this email with TAN?

Thank you,

Dear all,

This summer, we are going to offer a mini-lecture series on
selected topics in star formation.  This lecture series is to
augment the general introductory classes on astrophysics and
offer detailed discussion on some of the fundamental and
important physical processes that occur in star formation.
The level of instruction is intended for graduate students
and research assistants working in either theoretical or
observational aspects of star formation, but anyone with an
interest in the subject is welcome.  Although there is no fee
required, we do encourage students to register in order for
us to estimate the number of participants and make
appropriate preparations.  You can register from here:

  http://www2.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/act/workshop/20090730/

and the registration deadline is July 24 (Fri), 2009.
The tentative lecture topics and dates are as follows:


<< Mini-Lecture Series on Physical Processes in Star Formation >>

Location: ASIAA, Room 716


7/30 (Thu)
    Hydrostatic Equilibria (1.5 hour lecture)
    Gravitational Collapse (1.5 hour lecture)
8/04 (Tue)
    Magnetohydrodynamics (1.5 hour lecture)
    Ambipolar Diffusion and Core Formation (1.5 hour lecture)
8/07 (Fri)
    Accretion Disk (1.5 hour lecture)
    Jets (1.5 hour lecture)


In addition to this, we offer basic lectures for star formation
as a part of the ASIAA summer student program lecture series:

7/28 (Tue)
    Observational View of Star Formation (1 hour lecture)
8/06 (Thu)
    Planet Formation (1 hour lecture)


Thank you,
Satoki Matsushita, Mike Cai, Sheng-Yuan Liu, and Chin-Fei Lee

Dear all,

We would like to invite you to attend a mini-workshop on magnetic
field at the Institute of Astronomy, National Tsing Hua University on
June 23-24 (Tue-Wed). The purpose of this informal workshop is to
gather people working on magnetic field related research and to
exchange idea. We will feature a couple of overview talks by Kinwah Wu
who is the Chair of Theoretical Astrophysics and Head of Theory in
Mullard Space Science Lab, University College London. The schedule of
the talks is as follow:

June 23

2pm  Radiative and dynamical processes in magnetically interacting
two-body systems (1hr+discussion), Kinwah Wu

3:15pm  High energy emission from rapidly rotating neutron-star
magnetospheres, Kouichi Hirotani (30min+discussion)

4pm Probing the pulsar wind in gamma-ray binary (30min+discussion),
Jumpei Takata

June 24

2pm  Cosmic magnetism --- a pedestrian's perspective (1hr+discussion), Kinwah Wu

3:15pm  Zooming in on the magnetic field structure around a protostar
(30min+discussion), Shih-Ping Lai

4pm  Vibrations of neutron stars promoted by frozen-in magnetic field
(30min+discussion), Sergey Bastrukov

All the talks will take place at NTHU-TIARA (8F, 2nd General Bld). ALL
are welcome.

Cheers,
Albert

Announcement of ADASS 2009 SAPPORO

We are pleased to announce the opening of registration for the
19th annual conference on Astronomical Data Analysis Software
and Systems (ADASS).  The conference will be held in Sapporo,
Japan at the Renaissance Sapporo Hotel during 4-8 October
2009.

The ADASS conference is held each year at a different hosting
astronomical institution. The conference provides a forum for
scientists and programmers concerned with algorithms, software
and software systems employed in the acquisition, reduction,
analysis, and dissemination of astronomical data.  The program
includes invited talks, contributed papers, display sessions,
tutorials, and computer demonstrations, as well as special
interest ("Birds of a Feather" or BOF) meetings.  These
activities aim to encourage communication between software
specialists, scientists, and also to stimulate further development
of astronomical software and systems.  We encourage you to
participate in this exciting conference by submitting an oral or
poster abstract, a demonstration, or a BoF proposal.

Key topics for this year's conference include but are not
limited to:

* Time domain astronomy
* "Most dangerous" process, design & implementation errors
* Virtual Astronomical Observatory (VAO) and the Virtual Obsevatory
* Reusable archive technologies
* Commonly available development environments & tools

As this is the first ADASS in Asia, we encourage proposals that
deal with topics of special interest to Asia.

Details on the submission process can be found on the Conference
website at http://www.adass.org/.

Important Dates:
-----------------
Registration/Abstract Submission Opens: May 27, 2009
Deadline for Oral and Poster Abstract Submission: July 15, 2009
Deadline for Demo Submission: July 15, 2009
End of Early (discounted) Registration: July 31, 2009
Deadline for BoF Submission: August 31, 2009

The Conference website will be updated regularly during the next
few months to include information about the program, the current
list of attendees, and the submitted abstracts.  Please review
the calendar of important events and deadlines.

We look forward to seeing you in Sapporo!

Sincerely,
