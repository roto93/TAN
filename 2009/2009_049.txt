Dear Colleagues,

The CFHT-Taiwan (CFHT-T) User's Committee plans to hold a User's 
meeting at 1:30pm - 4:30pm on 4 May 2009 (Monday) in ASIAA.  All 
users of the CFHT in Taiwan are strongly encouraged to attend. This 
meeting is open to the entire scientific community.

The purposes of this meeting are to:

1.  Communicate exciting new scientific results from Taiwan's CFHT 
user community

2.  Identify areas of concern - in particular data reduction, analyses,
and interpretation -  that need to be addressed to quicken 
publication.  Future support from funding agencies for the CFHT-T 
program depends crucially on publishing the data already taken on 
the CFHT.

This meeting provides an opportunity for members of the CFHT-T 
Time Assignment Committee (TAC) to assess the status of individual 
projects.  As mentioned in the last Call for CFHT-T Proposals, progress 
on past projects will be given increasing weight in allocating future 
time on the CFHT.

Please let Bau-Ching Hsieh (bchsieh@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw) know if you 
would like to attend, and the title of your talk, by 5 pm on 27 Apr 2009.

sincerely, 

Paul Bau-Ching Hsieh (Chair, Taiwan CFHT User's Committee)
Michihiro Takami (Chair, Taiwan CFHT Time Assignment Committee) 
Shiang-Yu Wang (PI, Taiwan CFHT Program)
