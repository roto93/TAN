We are going to have the Solar System Workshop at National Central
University on 25-27 February 2009. The main purpose of the workshop is
to have interactions among ISS and OSS communities members of PS1
science consortium and look for initiating further collaborations.

On 25 February, we will have 1-day MOPS Hands-On Workshop prior to the
main scientific workshop. MOPS (Moving Object Processing System) is a
state-of-art software system to detect moving objects and perform the
orbit determination. Larry Denneau kindly gives a lecture on MOPS
system. There will be scientific talks and intensive discussions on
successive 2 days, on 26 and 27 February 2009.

The website of the workshop can be found at following address. Please
