Dear Dr. Yi-Jehng Kuan 

I am writing to let you know about a new SETI Institute initiative 
called "Earth Speaks." We are gathering messages that people would want 
to communicate to extraterrestrial intelligence. Our goal is to make 
this a global project, so would welcome messages from you and your 
friends and colleagues throughout Taiwan. 

For more on the project, and to submit your messages, please see:

I hope you and your family are well. 

Best, 
Doug
