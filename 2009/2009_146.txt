                   ALMA User Workshop
                 February 8 to 10, 2010

   Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Academia Sinica

Announcement

The Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics at Academia Sinica (ASIAA) is
pleased to host the first user workshop for local ALMA users in Taiwan.

This workshop aims to provide practical information on how to plan, propose,
reduce, and analyze ALMA observations. Assuming that the participants know
about radio astronomy and interferometry, we will NOT cover those topics in
this workshop. Brand new users will have to attend further radio
astronomy/interferometry schools or classes.

Due to limited space and the hands-on nature of this workshop, participation
will be limited to 50 people. Upon registration, students outside the Taipei
City/County can apply for travel support (including transportation and
accommodation) from ASIAA, if they do not have any support from their
supervisor or university.

Workshop Goals:
1. To prepare Taiwanese astronomers for observations with ALMA.
2. To provide an update on the full and early science capabilities of ALMA.
3. To provide practical information on how to plan and execute ALMA
   observations
4. To discuss Taiwanese ALMA science projects & foster collaborations.
5. To introduce the Observing Tool (OT) and the ALMA data reduction
   software (CASA), and provide hands-on demonstrations of their use.
