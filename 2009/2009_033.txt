The 2nd Circular
----------------

The 2009 Scientific Assembly of the Astronomical Society of the Republic of
China (ASROC2009) will be held at National Museum of Marine Biology & Aquarium
on May 22 - 24, 2009. This is the annual event for all astronomers and
astrophysicists in Taiwan to demonstrate their most recent discoveries and
observations, to report their latest research results, to exchange ideas, and
to organize possible cooperation. ASROC2009 is also an excellent venue for
graduate students to present their research finding or progress from their
thesis studies. The tentative program can be found in the above mentioned
PDF files.

Contributed talks of 12 minutes in length and conference posters in all areas
of astronomy and astrophysics are solicited. In addition, an educational
symposium will be held in parallel to scientific sessions. Furthermore, special
EPO events for amateur astronomers and the general public to celebrate the
400th anniversary of the first use of an astronomical telescope by Galileo
Galilei and the International Year of Astronomy (IYA2009) are being prepared.
These events include: a) exhibitions of astronomical books and instruments,
from Kweilin Book Co. and local telescope dealers; b) an exhibition of Taiwan's
existing and/or future major astronomical facilities and projects including
Lulin 2-m, AMiBA, SMA, ALMA-T, CFHT and NCT; and c) an astrophotography
exhibition from renowned local astrophotographers. Together, a stargazing
carnival for the general public participated by the Ken-Ting Observatory and
amateur astronomers will be taken place in Saturday evening of May 23.

ASROC2009 on-line registration will be available from March 20. Participants of
the scientific assembly should submit their abstracts and register on-line by
April 24. Registration fees of NT$500 for meeting participants and NT$250 for
guests should be paid on site. Entrance fee to the Museum of Marine Biology is
waived during the 3-day meeting upon paying the registration fee.

The Astronomical Society cordially invites you to participate in this annual
event with all the many interesting and exciting activities, not to mention the
beautiful scenery and relaxed atmosphere in the Kenting National Park at the
southern tip of Taiwan. For more details and updated information, please visit
