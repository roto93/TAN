NCU Colloquium

Date/Time: February 13, 2009 (Friday) 14:00

Place: NCU S4-1013

Speaker: Prof. Leo Blitz (UC Berkeley)

Title: The Odd Dark Matter Halo of the Milky Way

Abstract:

Recent all sky surveys of atomic hydrogen in the Milky Way have made it 
possible to reevaluate the surface density, the warp and the thickness of 
the neutral gas layer with unprecedented accuracy.  As a result it is 
possible, for the first time, to trace the spiral arms out to the edge of 
the gas disk, and to show that the warp is well described by the 
superposition of three and only three bending modes.  To make sense of the 
HI distribution, it is necessary to ascribe an significant asymmetry to 
the dark matter halo of the Galaxy.  The magnitude of this deviation from 
axisymmetry is a noteworthy constraint to simulations of the growth of 
structure in the Universe.
