Dear colleagues,
I attach to this e-mail some information about the International School 
for Advanced Instrumentation. Please, forward to the people that may be 
interested on it.

****************************************************************

       *** Call for applications**
*** Please forward to potential students or interested departments***

              Important: Deadline February 15th 2009

The Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias and partner institutions
announce the inauguration of the International School for Advanced
Instrumentation (IScAI).

The IScAI is a major collaborative international initiative in
higher education that aims to become a centre of excellence to learn
expertise in all areas related to the construction of cutting-edge
scientific instrumentation, with a particular emphasis on astronomical
instrumentation. The IScAI will offer a highly specialized set of
courses and laboratory work to be held in research institutions with
world-class instrumentation programs and high-tech companies with
expertise in design and construction of scientific instrumentation.

The IScAI will start in June 2009 and is open to astronomers,
physicists and engineers world-wide. The deadline for applications is
February 15, 2009. Enrolled students in this first year of the IScAI
may be eligible for financial aid. The IScAI 2009 is funded by the
grant "First Science with the GTC", under the Consolider-Ingenio 2010
Programme of the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation.

For more information about the IScAI and the registration procedure,

                                     First Announcement
                                       January 23, 2009

Dear Colleagues,

    The 4th International Symposium on Symmetries in Subatomic Physics
(SSP 2009) will be held on June 2-5, 2009 at Department of Physics, 
National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan. We would like to invite you 
to attend and contribute to the success of the meeting. 
     It is fair to say that symmetries, or possible breakings of 
symmetries, have always played pivotal roles in connection with major 
developments in subatomic physics, i.e., the physics of nuclei and 
elementary particles. Indeed, major breakthroughs had sprung from the 
discovery of parity violation, to CP or T symmetry and its violation, to 
gauge symmetry and its spontaneous breaking, and many others.
    As stated concisely by C. N. Yang in his closing speech of the First 
International Symposium on Symmetries in Subatomic Physics, "If you look 
at the history of the 20th century physics, there is every indication that 
the symmetry concept has emerged as one of the most fundamental themes, 
which still occupies the central stage in today's theoretical physics" and
"it is safe to say that for the next ten or twenty years many theoretical 
physicists will continue to try to play variations on the theme of symmetry 
in order to arrive at the next breakthrough."
    The idea of organizing a symposium on symmetries in subatomic physics 
came out in our informal conversation to have an occasion to mark the 
seventieth birthday of Professor Ernest M. Henley, our dearest friend for 
quite some time. Upon consulting many friends of Ernest's in the academic 
circle (most of them eventually showed up at the meeting), it was felt 
strongly that the subject matter which is under discussion, namely "Symmetries 
in Subatomic Physics", is an ideal topic for a new series of IUPAP-sponsored 
topical conferences - a suggestion which turned out to determine how the series 
of symposia was organized. And it means that, according to the IUPAP policy 
(which we had tried hard to carefully observe throughout our organization of the 
meetings), the Symposium itself is no longer officially connected in any way 
with a birthday celebration of a living physicist.
    The first symposium was organized in 1994 at Taipei, the second in 1996 at 
Seattle, the third in 1998 at Adelaide, and the fourth until now. In fact, the 
fourth should have happened in 2000 but our German colleague, who was in charge 
of the event, had decided to go to Netherlands. Well, we have to pick up somewhere 
in some way and, after all, we believe that the conference topics are indeed very 
important.
    We are very proud to have the same conference twice here in Taiwan. I suspect 
that it will rotate away ¡V I won't see it again in Taiwan.
    We are looking forward to seeing you in Taipei.

                                    W-Y. Pauchy Hwang

Dear Yi-Jehng, 

Could you please post the message about Solar System Working Group of 
HSC project to the TAN network? 

Thank you, 

Daisuke 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
HSC (Hyper Suprime-Cam) is a next generation wide-field camera for 
8.2-m Subaru telescope at the summit of Mauna Kea. HSC project is an 
international effort by 3 partners, Japan, Princeton University, and 
Taiwan. 

HSC is designed to have 1.5 deg. field-of-view. The project is going 
to apply 300 nights over 5 years starting in 2012. Although, the weak 
lensing and galaxy evolution are two big scientific objectives, we can 
do other sciences as well. 

Until yesterday, we had Japan-Princeton-Taiwan HSC workshop here in 
Tokyo. Japanese group has been discussed survey parameters, such as 
area, depth, cadence, under the framework of "wide", "deep", 
"ultra-deep" survey modes, but now the structure is re-organized. 10 
science-oriented working groups are formed. These working groups will 
summarize the science drivers and observation requirements until May 
2009. 

For solar system sciences, Dr. Yoshida Fumi at National Astronomical 
Observatory of Japan is the coordinator for Solar System Working 
Group. If you are interested in using the HSC data for solar system 
sciences, you definitely need to join the discussion in the working 
group. I was asked to compile a list of names and e-mail addresses of 
Taiwanese astronomers who is willing to join the Solar System Working 
Group for HSC. 

Please let me (Kinoshita Daisuke, kinoshita@astro.ncu.edu.tw) know 
your name and e-mail address if you are interested in joining the HSC 
Solar System Working Group. Then, I pass the list of Taiwanese 
astronomers to Dr. Yoshida. 

Thank you, 

Daisuke
