ASIAA Call for SMA proposals for 2009A

Dear Colleagues,

The ASIAA SMA TAC solicits proposals for the ASIAA time of the
Submillimeter Array (SMA) for the period (2009A semester) from
May 16th to November 15th, 2009.  Those who are affiliated to a
Taiwanese university or a Taiwanese research institute are eligible
to apply for the ASIAA SMA time as a principal investigator (PI).

The deadline for proposal submission for the ASIAA SMA time for
the 2009A semester is March 6 (Friday), 2009, 5AM in the morning
(Taiwan time).  [The deadline corresponds to March 5 (Thursday),
11AM HST in Hawaii, USA, and 4PM EST in Cambridge, USA.]

All Taiwanese SMA proposals must be submitted through the SMA
submission facility (https://sma1.sma.hawaii.edu/propose.html).
New proposers in particular need to get registered (through the
submission web site) before submitting a proposal.

When submitting your proposal, please make sure to select
"ASIAA" as your destination TAC in the submission web page.
Please direct your inquiries to TATSUHIKO HASEGAWA
(hasegawa AT asiaa.sinica.edu.tw).

For technical information on the SMA, please visit
    http://sma1.sma.hawaii.edu/proposing.html (will be ready soon).
The SAO SMA information page has been updated for 2009A.
For Taiwan and ASIAA specific aspects (including the ASIAA proposal
selection process and the amount of available observing time),
please visit
    http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/~SMART/ .

A few cautions (among many) about proposal format and writing merit
reiterating.
- In addition to the page limit, there is a limit to the font size
   (11 point or larger).
- A request for a good weather without a compelling reason tends to
   get a lower rating from reviewers.

The SMA is a complex instrument.  Consultation or collaboration
with those who are familiar with the SMA is highly recommended.
Contact points for consultations are also found in the ASIAA
web page listed above.

Additional messages from the ASIAA SMA TAC :

The PI of a successful proposal will be encouraged to provide an
observer at the summit of Mauna Kea.  For more detail, please
consult the ASIAA web page listed above.

In order to encourage PhD students to use the SMA, the ASIAA SMA TAC
will make some considerations to proposals for PhD thesis projects.
Please visit the ASIAA web site for details.

In order to make efficient use of SMA data, the ASIAA SMA TAC will expect
Co-Is to follow up the analysis and publication of already executed or
allocated projects under a PI who becomes unable to do the work for
various reasons.  Potential co-investigators should be aware of their
possible responsibilities or obligations.  PIs should make best efforts
to obtain a consent before putting someone's name on a proposal as a
Co-I.

Sincerely,

Tatsuhiko Hasegawa
ASIAA SMA TAC Chair

Dear all,

Professor Keiichi Wada from NAOJ is to visit IAA from 2/18 to 2/24. Professor Wada is an
active theorist working mainly in the area of numerical simulation of gas dynamics and
ISM physics in galaxies and his visit is detailed in Kazushi's email sent on 2/14. On
Friday 2/20 he is going to give a talk entitled

"Intrinsic Structures of "Galactic Shocks" and Origin of Spiral Arms"

The abstract of the talk can be read at 

http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/act/colloquium.php

Please mark your calendar and remember to join the event.

Dear Pauchy,

Here I am writing this mail as a members of IUPAP Commission C12.

Recently C12 has announced the IUPAP young scientist prize which
shall be awarded at the next International nuclear physics conference 
on nuclear physics in Vancouver July 4-9, 2010. 

The announcement is attached. Could you please circulate this
information among the Taiwanese nuclear scientists and publish it
in your local nuclear physics (or physics) society newsletters, 
if possible.

At the same time, could you please publish this announcement in the
AAPPS as you kindly did last time? 

Thanking in advance for your kind assistance.

   Sincerely,
   Hide Sakai

Vice Chair of C12, the IUPAP Commission on Nuclear Physics

IUPAP YOUNG SCIENTIST PRIZE IN NUCLEAR PHYSICS

The purpose of this prize, which consists of 1,000 £á, a medal, and a certificate citing the recipient's contributions, is: 

To recognize and encourage very promising experimental or theoretical research in nuclear physics, including the advancement of a method, a procedure, a technique, or a device that contributes in a significant way to nuclear physics research. Candidates for the prize must have a maximum of eight years of research experience (excluding career interruptions) following the Ph.D. (or equivalent) degree. 

Nominations by one or two nominators (and distinct from the nominee) are open to all experimental and theoretical nuclear physicists. Three prizes will ordinarily be awarded at the time of the tri-annual International Nuclear Physics Conference. 

Nominations are due October 1 of the year preceding the International Nuclear Physics Conference and are valid only until then. It will be extremely helpful to the selection committee to receive at least two additional letters supporting the nomination that detail the expected significance of the contributions of the nominee to nuclear physics. It is also appropriate to submit additional materials such as published articles that underline the expected significance of the nominee's contribution to nuclear physics. It is important that the selection committee has the specific information that allows it to determine what the nominee has contributed and how this contribution is expected to impact the field. 

Nominations for prizes to be awarded at the next International Nuclear Physics Conference, July 4-9, 2010, in Vancouver, Canada, are to be sent by email by October 1, 2009 to the Chair of the IUPAP Commission of Nuclear Physics (C12): Dan-Olof Riska, Helsinki Institute of Physics, Dan-Olof.Riska@helsinki.fi, subject "IUPAP prize nomination".
