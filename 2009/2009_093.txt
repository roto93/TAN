Subject: [Colloquium] ASIAA Colloquium this week

Dear all,

This week we have 2 visitors: Professor Toshiya Ueta from University of Denver (visiting
8/10-8/16) and Dr. Masahiro Machida from NAOJ (8/11-8/21). 

Professor Ueta's main research interests include stellar evolution, especially the late
stages from the Red Giant to the Planetary Nebula phases involving mass loss processes, 
interaction of stellar mass loss and the interstellar medium, radiative transfer in
dusty media, and infrared observations of dusty media. Dr. Machida is an active theorist
in star formation, especially on numerical MHD modeling. His interest spans a variety of
topics in star formation, from launch of outflows/jets to gas planet formation and so on. 

On Thursday Dr. Ueta is giving a talk on 

"Interaction between Stellar Winds and the Interstellar Medium around Evolved Stars", 

and on Friday Dr. Machida on 

"Fragmentation and binary formation in the star formation process". 

Please mark your calendar and remember to join the events.
