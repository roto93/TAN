Speaker  : Dr. S.Guilloteau (Laboratoire d'Astrophysique de Bordeaux)
Title        : Searching for disk dissipation
Time       : 6/18 (Thursday) 2 pm
Location : ASIAA Room 716

<< Abstract >>
Identifying the proto-planetary disk dissipation mechanisms
is an important step towards understanding the planetary
system formation process and the variety of planetary
systems produced.

Accretion onto the star, viscous spreading of the disk,
planet formation and photo-evaporation are among the main
processes contributing to the disk disappearance.

I will present some examples of attempts to pinpoint which
process dominates from mm observations of a few disks. I
will focus on two recent findings
- the role and nature of inner cavities found in disks
- using CO as a potential tracer of disk dissipation
