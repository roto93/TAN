Arizona Radio Observatory: Call for Proposals (Spring 2009)
------------------------------------------------------------

Dear all,

ASIAA's ARO proposal deadline for Spring 2009 (February - June 2009)
is set on February 11, 2009 (Wednesday).

The Arizona Radio Observatory operates the Sub-Millimeter Telescope (SMT)
and the Kitt Peak 12 Meter.  The SMT currently supports a dual-polarization,
ALMA Band-6 1 mm receiver, a dual-polarization 0.8 mm receiver, and a new
ALMA Band-9 (602-720 GHz) dual-polarization receiver.   The 12 m supports
2 mm and 3 mm (65-176 GHz) dual-polarization receivers.  A new ALMA Band-3
receiver is now available at the 12 m for the 85-116 GHz band (3 mm HI),
also dual-polarization. Remote observing is available at both ARO telescopes.

Please refer to http://aro.as.arizona.edu/ for more details.

Information about Remote Observing can be viewed at:
http://aro.as.arizona.edu/remote/remote.htm.
For further information about remote observing and other operational questions,
please contact Tom Folkers, Operations Manager: tfolkers@as.arizona.edu.
