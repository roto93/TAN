 Proposals for CFHT Open for Semester 2010A

############################################

 

The 3.6 meter optical/infrared Canadian-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) is
now open

for proposals from all Taiwan-based researchers for semester 2010A. The
deadline

for proposal submission is: 

24 September 2009 - 8:00 am Taiwan time 

We anticipate that a minimum of 5 nights, and possibly up to 10 nights, will
be

available in semester 2010A, depending on demand and quality of proposals.
Please

note that the instruments available for 2010A are MegaCam, WIRCam, ESPaDOnS,


GriF, and PUEO. GriF is offered with the Fabry-Perot only.

Detailed information on the telescope, available instrumentation, proposal

format, and how to submit proposals is available from the CFHT web page: 

 

http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/ObsInfo/ObservingProposals/ 

 

### Important Change ###

 

1. After the former TAC chair (Dr. Lim) left Taiwan, the TAC members has
been

   replaced (Dr. Lim -> Dr. Takami) and added (Dr Ohyama and Lai). The
present

   members thus are:-

 

     Hiro Takami (ASIAA, chair), Shiang-Yu Wang (ASIAA) Chorn-Yuan Hwang
(NCU)

     You-Hua Chu (U. Illinois), Yoichi Oyama (ASIAA), Shih-Ping, Lai (NTHU)

 

   The members may be changed from 10B, based on the next NSC grant
application.

   We will give further info later.

 

2. Publications based on data taken with and through Taiwan's

   access to the CFHT in the period since 1 October 2009 onwards (until
further notice)

   should contain the following acknowledgement:

 

   Access to the CFHT was made possible by the Institute of Astronomy and
Astrophysics,

   Academia Sinica, National Tsing Hua University, and National Science
Council, Taiwan.

### Exploratory Programs ###
 

To encourage innovative science, this semester we will continue considering

"exploratory" programs using MegaCam, WIRCam, or ESPaDOnS that require

no more than 1 hour of observing time. Such proposals will not be refereed,
but will

be scrutinized by the TAC and allocated time based on scientific merit and
feasibility.

When submitting such proposals, please state at the beginning of the
scientific 

justification that "This is an EXPLORATORY proposal".

 

### Queued Service Observations Snapshot Programs ###

 

In addition, we would like to bring to your attention the Queued Service
Observation

(QSO) snapshot program. These are programs that can be executed with either

MegaCam or WIRCam in relatively poor seeing conditions when the seeing is
>1.2".

Projects executed under the QSO snapshot program are not charged to the
available

observing time for Taiwan. Proposals to the QSO snapshot program will not be
refereed, 

but will be scrutinized by the TAC for scientific value and feasibility. 

 

### Resubmission due to Lost Time ###

 

If your scheduled project from previous semesters was not completed for any
reason

(including bad weather), you will need to resubmit your proposal explaining
why you

need more time. Your proposal will be stronger if the available data has
been analyzed,

and you use this data to demonstrate that the stated science goals can be
achieved

with allocation of the full requested time. 

 

### Time Allocation Process ###

 

All new proposals, and where deemed necessary resubmitted proposals, are
refereed by

researchers selected by the Taiwan-CFHT TAC based on their demonstrated
expertise

in the relevant research fields. 

Apart from the referees comments, who are asked to evaluate primarily the
scientific

strength of the proposal, the Taiwan-CFHT TAC also takes into account
technical

feasibility. For those who have previously been scheduled observing time on
the CFHT,

the Taiwan-CFHT TAC will also take into account the  status of previously
executed

projects and publications. 

 

### Status of Previous Proposals ###

 

Please fill in or update the status of all your previous projects on the web
page 

https://oir.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/cfht/ [Authentication required] 

You can and should provide more details on the progress of previous
(especially related)

projects in the relevant section of your proposal. If no information is
forthcoming,

the TAC will assume that no progress has been made and will take this into 

consideration in allocation of observing time.
