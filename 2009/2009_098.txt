Arizona Radio Observatory: Call for Proposals (Fall 2009)
------------------------------------------------------------

Dear all,

ASIAA's ARO proposal deadline for Fall 2009 (October 2009 - January 2010)
is set on September 25, 2009 (Friday).

The Arizona Radio Observatory operates the Sub-Millimeter Telescope (SMT)
and the Kitt Peak 12 Meter.  The SMT currently supports a dual-polarization,
ALMA Band-6 1 mm receiver, a dual-polarization 0.8 mm receiver, and a new
ALMA Band-9 (602-720 GHz) dual-polarization receiver.   The 12 m supports
2 mm and 3 mm (65-176 GHz) dual-polarization receivers.  A new ALMA Band-3
receiver is now available at the 12 m for the 85-116 GHz band (3 mm HI),
also dual-polarization. Remote observing is available at both ARO telescopes.

Please refer to http://aro.as.arizona.edu/ for more details.

Information about Remote Observing can be viewed at:
http://aro.as.arizona.edu/remote/remote.htm.
For further information about remote observing and other operational questions,
please contact Tom Folkers, Operations Manager: tfolkers@as.arizona.edu.

People are required to use the KP12M and SMT proposal cover/summary
sheets for their proposals:
(under "Proposal Submission Information" at
  http://aro.as.arizona.edu/proposal_submission_information.htm
for the SMT -
  http://aro.as.arizona.edu/proposals/smt_prop_sub.htm
and for the 12m -
  http://aro.as.arizona.edu/proposals/12m_prop_sub.htm )

Proposals should consist of a proposal Cover Sheet, obtainable at
  http://aro.as.arizona.edu/proposals/ ,
and a brief scientific and technical justification. The justification
may be up to two pages of text, and should not exceed three pages including
tables, figures, references and a source list with observing time requirements.
For electronic submission, ASIAA only accepts proposals in either PS or PDF
format.

Please submit your proposals by 24:00 midnight September 25, 2009 to
kuan @ asiaa.sinica.edu.tw ; no late proposals will be accepted.


Kind regards,
Yi-Jehng Kuan
on behalf of the ASIAA ARO TAC

ASIAA Call for SMA proposals for 2009B

Dear Colleagues,

The ASIAA SMA TAC invites proposals for the ASIAA time
of the Submillimeter Array (SMA) for the period from
2009 October 16th to 2010 May 15th (2009B semester).
The ASIAA SMA time is open to those who are affiliated to
a Taiwanese university or a Taiwanese research institute.

The deadline for proposal submission for the ASIAA SMA time
for the 2009B semester is September 18, 2009, 4AM in the
morning (Taiwan time).  [The deadline corresponds to
September 17 (Thursday), 10AM in Hawaii, USA, and 4PM EDT
in Cambridge, USA.]

All Taiwanese SMA proposals must be submitted through the SMA
submission facility (http://sma1.sma.hawaii.edu/proposing.html).
New proposers in particular need to get registered (through
the submission web site) before submitting a proposal.
Taiwanese proposers should select "ASIAA" as their destination
TAC in the submission web page.  Please direct your inquiries
(in particular PI eligibility) to TATSUHIKO HASEGAWA
(hasegawa AT asiaa.sinica.edu.tw).

For technical information on the SMA, please visit
    http://sma1.sma.hawaii.edu/proposing.html   .
The SAO SMA information page has been updated for 2009B.
For Taiwan and ASIAA specific aspects (including the PI
eligibility, the ASIAA proposal selection process, and the
amount of available observing time), please visit
    http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/~SMART/  .

A few cautions about proposal format and writing merit reiterating.
- In addition to the page limit, there are limits to the font size
   (11 point or larger) and layout (two pages for text only and two
   pages for figures, tables, and references).
- A request for a good weather without a compelling reason tends to
   get a lower rating from reviewers.

Additional messages from the ASIAA SMA TAC :

A PI (Principal Investigator) should lead the proposed project, and
is expected to be the first author of the resulting papers.  If a PI
will not be able to do these, the PI should provide the reason in the
proposal.  For example, in a multi-wavelength, international campaign,
the PI for an SMA proposal may not be leading the entire project or
going to be the first author.  In such a case, the PI should provide
the background or circumstance in the proposal.

Should a PI become unable to do the work, Co-Is (Co-Investigators)
are expected to follow up the analysis and publication of already
executed or allocated projects under the PI.  Co-investigators should
be aware of their responsibilities or obligations.  PIs should make
best efforts to obtain a consent before putting someone's name on a
proposal as a Co-I.

The PI of a successful proposal will be encouraged to provide an
observer at the summit of Mauna Kea.  For more details, please
consult the ASIAA web page listed above.

In order to encourage PhD students to use the SMA, the ASIAA SMA TAC
will make some considerations to proposals for PhD thesis projects.
Please visit the ASIAA web site for details.

The SMA is a complex instrument.  Consultation or collaboration
with those who are familiar with the SMA is recommended.  Contact
points for consultation are also found in the ASIAA web page
listed above.

Sincerely,

Tatsuhiko Hasegawa
ASIAA SMA TAC Chair

The INAF ¡V Arcetri Astrophysical Observatory (Florence) intends to award a post-doctoral fellow-
ship in the field of star formation. The fellow is expected to focus his/her activity on observations of
OB star forming regions. In particular, he/she will participate in the investigation of high-mass star
formation in the Galaxy by means of large scale surveys at (sub)mm and IR wavelengths, comple-
mented by more focused, higher angular resolution observations of selected regions. Experience with
radio single-dish and interferometric observations and data analysis is requested, from centimeter to
sub-millimeter wavelengths.
Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent at the starting date of the fellowship. The gross yearly
salary will be 33,000 Euro. The fellowship will be granted for two years, conditional to a positive
evaluation of the research activity carried out during the first year, and will not entail social benefits
or medical insurance. No special application forms are required. The applicants should send a CV
and a list of publications to the above submission address and should arrange for two letters of rec-
ommendation to be sent separately to the same address. E-mail submission is accepted. Applications
should arrive in Arcetri no later than October 15, 2009. The starting date will be as early as possible
but is negotiable.
Application deadline: October 15, 2009
