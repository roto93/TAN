Postdoctoral Position at Ohio University
Theoretical High-Energy Astrophysics
========================================
Applications are requested for a postdoc
position in high-energy astrophysics. The
selected candidate will work with Prof.
Markus Boettcher at Ohio University on
models for the theoretical interpretation
of high-energy emission from blazars. A
Ph.D. in physics/astronomy and a strong
background in computational high-energy
astrophysics are required. Although the
research will be primarily theoretical,
an interest in observations and the coordi-
nation of multiwavelength campaigns would
be desirable. Also, a commitment to working
effectively with students, faculty and staff
from diverse backgrounds is required.

The position is initially for one year, but
may be extended up to three years, depending
on performance and availability of funding.
Starting date is negotiable, but can be as
early as December 1, 2009.

Interested applicants, please send a CV,
publication list, statement of research
experience and interests and contact in-
formation of at least three references
to

Dear All,

There are 2 scheduled colloquium talks this week. Due to the new building's situation, 
they will still be held in the old Room 716. On Tuesday (10/20) Dr. Shep Doeleman from 
CfA will give a talk entitled 

       "Observing an Event Horizon: Very Long Baseline 
        Interferometry of the Galactic Center".

And on Friday (10/23), Dr. Induk Lee from NCU present 
 
       "Bright Quasar Survey at Low Galactic Latitude"

Please mark your calendar and remember to join the events.
