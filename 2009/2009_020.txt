Dear Pauchy,

Here I am writing this mail as a members of IUPAP Commission C12.

Recently C12 has announced the IUPAP young scientist prize which
shall be awarded at the next International nuclear physics conference 
on nuclear physics in Vancouver July 4-9, 2010. 

The announcement is attached. Could you please circulate this
information among the Taiwanese nuclear scientists and publish it
in your local nuclear physics (or physics) society newsletters, 
if possible.

At the same time, could you please publish this announcement in the
AAPPS as you kindly did last time? 

Thanking in advance for your kind assistance.

   Sincerely,
   Hide Sakai

Vice Chair of C12, the IUPAP Commission on Nuclear Physics

IUPAP YOUNG SCIENTIST PRIZE IN NUCLEAR PHYSICS

The purpose of this prize, which consists of 1,000 £á, a medal, and a certificate citing the recipient's contributions, is: 

To recognize and encourage very promising experimental or theoretical research in nuclear physics, including the advancement of a method, a procedure, a technique, or a device that contributes in a significant way to nuclear physics research. Candidates for the prize must have a maximum of eight years of research experience (excluding career interruptions) following the Ph.D. (or equivalent) degree. 

Nominations by one or two nominators (and distinct from the nominee) are open to all experimental and theoretical nuclear physicists. Three prizes will ordinarily be awarded at the time of the tri-annual International Nuclear Physics Conference. 

Nominations are due October 1 of the year preceding the International Nuclear Physics Conference and are valid only until then. It will be extremely helpful to the selection committee to receive at least two additional letters supporting the nomination that detail the expected significance of the contributions of the nominee to nuclear physics. It is also appropriate to submit additional materials such as published articles that underline the expected significance of the nominee's contribution to nuclear physics. It is important that the selection committee has the specific information that allows it to determine what the nominee has contributed and how this contribution is expected to impact the field. 

Nominations for prizes to be awarded at the next International Nuclear Physics Conference, July 4-9, 2010, in Vancouver, Canada, are to be sent by email by October 1, 2009 to the Chair of the IUPAP Commission of Nuclear Physics (C12): Dan-Olof Riska, Helsinki Institute of Physics, Dan-Olof.Riska@helsinki.fi, subject "IUPAP prize nomination".
