Dear all,

This summer, we are going to offer a mini-lecture series on
selected topics in star formation.  This lecture series is to
augment the general introductory classes on astrophysics and
offer detailed discussion on some of the fundamental and
important physical processes that occur in star formation.
The level of instruction is intended for graduate students
and research assistants working in either theoretical or
observational aspects of star formation, but anyone with an
interest in the subject is welcome.  Although there is no fee
required, we do encourage students to register in order for
us to estimate the number of participants and make
appropriate preparations.  You can register from here:

  http://www2.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/act/workshop/20090730/

and the registration deadline is July 24 (Fri), 2009.
The tentative lecture topics and dates are as follows:


<< Mini-Lecture Series on Physical Processes in Star Formation >>

Location: ASIAA, Room 716


7/30 (Thu)
    Hydrostatic Equilibria (1.5 hour lecture)
    Gravitational Collapse (1.5 hour lecture)
8/04 (Tue)
    Magnetohydrodynamics (1.5 hour lecture)
    Ambipolar Diffusion and Core Formation (1.5 hour lecture)
8/07 (Fri)
    Accretion Disk (1.5 hour lecture)
    Jets (1.5 hour lecture)


In addition to this, we offer basic lectures for star formation
as a part of the ASIAA summer student program lecture series:

7/28 (Tue)
    Observational View of Star Formation (1 hour lecture)
8/06 (Thu)
    Planet Formation (1 hour lecture)


Thank you,
Satoki Matsushita, Mike Cai, Sheng-Yuan Liu, and Chin-Fei Lee
