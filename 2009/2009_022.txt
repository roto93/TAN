¡×¡×¡×¡×¡@First Announcement¡@¡×¡×¡×¡×
 
To arouse youngsters' interests in astronomy and improve interactions 
between young astronomers from different countries, in this IYA2009, we 
sincerely invite the students form the world to join the Asia-Pacific Youth 
Astronomy Camp taking place in Taiwan this summer. The main title of this 
summer school is "Evolution of Universe", containing various topics of
evolutions from galaxies, stars, and planets to life.

The participants' accommodation and board during the camp will be covered by 
the sponsors, but foreign participants need to pay for their own airfares 
and visas. Participants are expected to be undergraduate or first-year 
graduate students. The participants do not have to major in  astronomy or 
astrophysics, but essential astronomical knowledge is favorable.

The on-line application will begin on March 15. Our official website is 
under construction now, and will be on-line soon.  For more information,
