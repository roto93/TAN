                       2010 Star Formation Workshop
Massive Star Formation: Observations, Theory and Diagnostic Tools 

                            January 11-14, 2010 

Hosted by Astronomy Department, University of California, Berkeley 
                              Co-sponsored by 
       Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA) 
and The Theoretical Institute for Advanced Research in Astrophysics (TIARA) 

--------------------------------------------------------------------

The Astronomy Department, University of California, Berkeley will host a
Star Formation Workshop: Observations, Theories, and Diagnostic Tools from
January 11th-14th, 2010, on the campus of UCB. The Academia Sinica Institute
of Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA) and its Theoretical Institute for
Advanced Research for Astrophysics (TIARA), Taiwan, are co-sponsoring the
event. The workshop will take place at 106 Stanley Hall.

The theme of the workshop will be on the formation of the massive stars from
small to large scales, their observations, theories, and diagnostic tools.
Topics include theories of the formation, initial conditions, cloud cores,
accretion mechanisms, disks and outflows, magnetic fields, radiative transfer
tools, simulations, and connections to larger scales. Each of the talks is
scheduled for 30 minutes, followed by 15 minutes of questions and discussions.
Close interactions and lively discussions among the speakers and the
participants are the primary goals of the workshop. Participation in the entire
workshop is strongly recommended.

                   ALMA User Workshop
                 February 8 to 10, 2010

Announcement

The Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics at Academia Sinica (ASIAA) is
pleased to host the first user workshop for local ALMA users in Taiwan.

This workshop aims to provide practical information on how to plan, propose,
reduce, and analyze ALMA observations. Assuming that the participants know
about radio astronomy and interferometry, we will NOT cover those topics in
this workshop. Brand new users will have to attend further radio
astronomy/interferometry schools or classes.

Due to limited space and the hands-on nature of this workshop, participation
will be limited to 50 people. Upon registration, students outside the Taipei
City/County can apply for travel support (including transportation and
accommodation) from ASIAA, if they do not have any support from their
supervisor or university.

Workshop Goals:
1. To prepare Taiwanese astronomers for observations with ALMA.
2. To provide an update on the full and early science capabilities of ALMA.
3. To provide practical information on how to plan and execute ALMA
   observations
4. To discuss Taiwanese ALMA science projects & foster collaborations.
5. To introduce the Observing Tool (OT) and the ALMA data reduction
   software (CASA), and provide hands-on demonstrations of their use.

Dear Colleagues,

   On Monday 14 December 2009, we will hold a one-day miniworkshop
entitled "Subaru HSC Sciences on Variable and Transients" at NCU:

         SUBARU HSC SCIENCES ON VARIABLE AND TRANSIENTS

    The National Central University of Taiwan (NCU) will host a one-day
    mini workshop on Dec 14, 2009, entitled "Subaru HSC Sciences on
    Variable  and Transients", at the Institute of Astronomy, NCU, Taiwan.
    With a view to stimulating OIR science activities in Taiwan and
    developing scientific collaborations between astronomers in Japan and
    Taiwan, this miniworkshop will focus on particular topics of variable
    and transient phenomena to be explored by ongoing and forthcoming
    optical sky surveys, such as PanSTARRS and Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam
    (HSC), where HSC is a next generation wide-field (1.5 degree field
    of view) prime-focus camera for the Japanese 8.2m  Subaru Telescope
    at the summit of Mauna Kea, Hawaii. Development of the camera
    started in 2007 and is planned to be completed in 2012. ASIAA is an
    international partner of the Subaru HSC project. All Taiwanese
    astronomers are welcome to join the survey. This WS will also provide
    an overview and status of the HSC survey designs and strategies (wide,
    deep, ultra-deep) proposed by astronomers in Japan, Taiwan, and
    Princeton University for different science drivers.

    Title :: Subaru HSC Sciences on Variable and Transients
