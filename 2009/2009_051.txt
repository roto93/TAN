Dear Colleagues,

The CFHT-Taiwan (CFHT-T) User's Committee plans to hold a User's 
meeting at 1:30pm - 4:30pm on 4 May 2009 (Monday) in ASIAA.  All 
users of the CFHT in Taiwan are strongly encouraged to attend. This 
meeting is open to the entire scientific community.

The purposes of this meeting are to:

1.  Communicate exciting new scientific results from Taiwan's CFHT 
user community

2.  Identify areas of concern - in particular data reduction, analyses,
and interpretation -  that need to be addressed to quicken 
publication.  Future support from funding agencies for the CFHT-T 
program depends crucially on publishing the data already taken on 
the CFHT.

This meeting provides an opportunity for members of the CFHT-T 
Time Assignment Committee (TAC) to assess the status of individual 
projects.  As mentioned in the last Call for CFHT-T Proposals, progress 
on past projects will be given increasing weight in allocating future 
time on the CFHT.

Please let Bau-Ching Hsieh (bchsieh@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw) know if you 
would like to attend, and the title of your talk, by 5 pm on 27 Apr 2009.

sincerely, 

Paul Bau-Ching Hsieh (Chair, Taiwan CFHT User's Committee)
Michihiro Takami (Chair, Taiwan CFHT Time Assignment Committee) 
Shiang-Yu Wang (PI, Taiwan CFHT Program)

	ALMA is the largest ground based, international astronomical
observational facility ever built, and is a partnership of North  
America, Europe, and Japan in cooperation with the Republic of Chile.
It is currently under construction in the Chajnantor area in the Atacama
desert in northern Chile. ALMA will be studying a broad range of exciting
science, such as weather
  patterns on solar system planets, the formation of planets and stars  
in our
  galaxy, the motions within active galactic nuclei, and the formation  
of the
  earliest galaxies at z~10. Taiwan has collaborations with both the  
ALMA-Japan
  and the ALMA-North America components of the project and is  
participating
  various construction activities. You can find some more information  
on the
  project at http://alma.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw.

  	Below is the preliminary agenda of the meeting:

  â~@§ Science Preparation with ALMA-EA and ALMA-NA
  â~@§ ALMA Region Center in Taiwan
  â~@§ Proposal Submission

	The meeting will start with a dinner reception at 6PM prior to the
  discussion. If you are interested in attending the dinner reception
