Arizona Radio Observatory: Call for Proposals (Spring 2009)
------------------------------------------------------------

Dear all,

ASIAA's ARO proposal deadline for Spring 2009 (February - June 2009)
is set on February 11, 2009 (Wednesday).

The Arizona Radio Observatory operates the Sub-Millimeter Telescope (SMT)
and the Kitt Peak 12 Meter.  The SMT currently supports a dual-polarization,
ALMA Band-6 1 mm receiver, a dual-polarization 0.8 mm receiver, and a new
ALMA Band-9 (602-720 GHz) dual-polarization receiver.   The 12 m supports
2 mm and 3 mm (65-176 GHz) dual-polarization receivers.  A new ALMA Band-3
receiver is now available at the 12 m for the 85-116 GHz band (3 mm HI),
also dual-polarization. Remote observing is available at both ARO telescopes.

Please refer to http://aro.as.arizona.edu/ for more details.

Information about Remote Observing can be viewed at:
http://aro.as.arizona.edu/remote/remote.htm.
For further information about remote observing and other operational questions,
please contact Tom Folkers, Operations Manager: tfolkers@as.arizona.edu.

People are required to use the KP12M and SMT proposal cover/summary
sheets for their proposals:
(under "Proposal Submission Information" at
  http://aro.as.arizona.edu/proposal_submission_information.htm
for the SMT -
  http://aro.as.arizona.edu/proposals/smt_prop_sub.htm
and for the 12m -
  http://aro.as.arizona.edu/proposals/12m_prop_sub.htm )

Proposals should consist of a proposal Cover Sheet, obtainable at
  http://aro.as.arizona.edu/proposals/ ,
and a brief scientific and technical justification. The justification
may be up to two pages of text, and should not exceed three pages including
tables, figures, references and a source list with observing time requirements.
For electronic submission, ASIAA only accepts proposals in either PS or PDF
format.

Please submit your proposals by 24:00 midnight February 11, 2009 to
kuan @ asiaa.sinica.edu.tw ; no late proposals will be accepted.


Kind regards,
Yi-Jehng Kuan
on behalf of the ASIAA ARO TAC

We are going to have the Solar System Workshop at National Central
University on 25-27 February 2009. The main purpose of the workshop is
to have interactions among ISS and OSS communities members of PS1
science consortium and look for initiating further collaborations.

On 25 February, we will have 1-day MOPS Hands-On Workshop prior to the
main scientific workshop. MOPS (Moving Object Processing System) is a
state-of-art software system to detect moving objects and perform the
orbit determination. Larry Denneau kindly gives a lecture on MOPS
system. There will be scientific talks and intensive discussions on
successive 2 days, on 26 and 27 February 2009.

The website of the workshop can be found at following address. Please
check the website for the detail.
