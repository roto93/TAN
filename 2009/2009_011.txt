                                     First Announcement
                                       January 23, 2009

Dear Colleagues,

    The 4th International Symposium on Symmetries in Subatomic Physics
(SSP 2009) will be held on June 2-5, 2009 at Department of Physics, 
National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan. We would like to invite you 
to attend and contribute to the success of the meeting. 
     It is fair to say that symmetries, or possible breakings of 
symmetries, have always played pivotal roles in connection with major 
developments in subatomic physics, i.e., the physics of nuclei and 
elementary particles. Indeed, major breakthroughs had sprung from the 
discovery of parity violation, to CP or T symmetry and its violation, to 
gauge symmetry and its spontaneous breaking, and many others.
    As stated concisely by C. N. Yang in his closing speech of the First 
International Symposium on Symmetries in Subatomic Physics, "If you look 
at the history of the 20th century physics, there is every indication that 
the symmetry concept has emerged as one of the most fundamental themes, 
which still occupies the central stage in today's theoretical physics" and
"it is safe to say that for the next ten or twenty years many theoretical 
physicists will continue to try to play variations on the theme of symmetry 
in order to arrive at the next breakthrough."
    The idea of organizing a symposium on symmetries in subatomic physics 
came out in our informal conversation to have an occasion to mark the 
seventieth birthday of Professor Ernest M. Henley, our dearest friend for 
quite some time. Upon consulting many friends of Ernest's in the academic 
circle (most of them eventually showed up at the meeting), it was felt 
strongly that the subject matter which is under discussion, namely "Symmetries 
in Subatomic Physics", is an ideal topic for a new series of IUPAP-sponsored 
topical conferences - a suggestion which turned out to determine how the series 
of symposia was organized. And it means that, according to the IUPAP policy 
(which we had tried hard to carefully observe throughout our organization of the 
meetings), the Symposium itself is no longer officially connected in any way 
with a birthday celebration of a living physicist.
    The first symposium was organized in 1994 at Taipei, the second in 1996 at 
Seattle, the third in 1998 at Adelaide, and the fourth until now. In fact, the 
fourth should have happened in 2000 but our German colleague, who was in charge 
of the event, had decided to go to Netherlands. Well, we have to pick up somewhere 
in some way and, after all, we believe that the conference topics are indeed very 
important.
    We are very proud to have the same conference twice here in Taiwan. I suspect 
that it will rotate away ¡V I won't see it again in Taiwan.
    We are looking forward to seeing you in Taipei.

                                    W-Y. Pauchy Hwang
