PROBING STRONG GRAVITY WITH GRAVITATIONAL AND ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES

First announcement for an event (H02) at the
38th COSPAR Scientific Assembly - Bremen (Germany), 2010 July 18-25

Duration: 4 half-days

Commissions E (Research in Astrophysics from Space) and H (Fundamental
Physics in Space)
Sub-commissions: E1 (Galactic and Extragalactic Astrophysics)

Scientific rationale:

Neutron stars and black holes probe the strongest gravitational fields found
in the present-day Universe. A large number of such objects is continuously
monitored with high-energy satellites. In parallel, the recent discovery of
a binary radio pulsar allows precise measurements of GR parameters at a
larger distance from compact objects. Soon, these objects will be detected
with upcoming gravitational-wave observatories, which will open another
avenue for the study of strong gravity and the test of GR predictions. The
scope of this two-day COSPAR session is to bring together experimentalists,
observers, and theorists in these separate by complementary fields and
discuss the strategies and aims of testing general relativity in the
strong-field regime in the near future.
