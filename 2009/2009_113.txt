Abstract:
 
Fairly complex molecules are known to exist in various
interstellar molecular clouds and circumstellar envelopes. In
order to identify these species, laboratory spectroscopy data
are indispensable. The astronomical observations and
identifications of molecular species are ultimate remote
sensing. In this talk, before discussing the laboratory
spectroscopy, a brief overview of interstellar molecular clouds
will be presented. The interplay between the laboratory
spectroscopy, mostly microwave to submillimeter-wave regions,
and astronomical observations will be discussed by showing some
historical developments. Finally I will discuss some recent
laboratory submillimeter-wave results on molecular cations as
well as molecular anions.
