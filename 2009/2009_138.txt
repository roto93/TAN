Subject: The First APCosPA Winter School


                                        November 27, 2009
Dear Colleagues:

     The pace of the advancement in the area of Cosmology and Particle 
Astrophysics (CosPA) is amazedly fast since the new century. The 
researchers in the Asia Pacific region, including Australia, China, Japan, 
Korea, and Taiwan, have played their due roles in making the progresses. 
To make our marks more noticeable, we are forming the Asia Pacific Center 
for Cosmology and Particle Astrophysics (APCosPA Center), starting from 
nothing but hopefully growing eventually into something fairly visible.

     One beginning is to hold the First APCosPA Winter School, 18-29 
January 2010, at National Taiwan University, Taipei. We will try to cover 
the various topics in Cosmology and Particle Astrophysics but mainly 
toward the graduate students and young researchers. The lecturers include:

     Dharam vir Ahluwalia (Canterbury, NZ);
     Robert Brandenberger (Mcgill, Canada);
     Pei-Ming Ho (Taida, Taipei);
     Xiangdong Ji (Maryland, USA); 
     Taka Kajino (NAO, Japan);
     Sang Pyo Kim (Kunsan, Korea);
     Miao Li (ITP, Beijing);
     Bo-Qiang Ma (Beida, Beijing);
     Jen-Chieh Peng (UIUC, USA);
     Bin Wang (Fudan, China);
     Jun'ichi Yokoyama (Tokyo, Japan). 

Each will give three or four lectures, with a couple of hard problems. And 
the registered students or young postdocs could enter the competitions 
with the awards given to the first few "students". 

                                   Sincerely yours, W-Y. Pauchy Hwang
