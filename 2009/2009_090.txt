Dear Colleagues:

     I'm using the hep and astro nets to announce the formation of a 
Nuclear Physics Association - many physics sub-fields in Taiwan still do 
not have their own networks.

     Keep tuned on what's going on on this Asian Nuclear Physics 
Association.

                                           Best wishes, Pauchy

Dear Pauchy:

Nuclear Physics communities in Asia spent almost a year to prepare
ANPhA (Asian Nuclear Physics Association) and, finally, started today
as an official organization.

We had meetings among China, Korea and Japan and created Bylaws.  
We are still inviting new members from Australia, India, Taiwan, etc.
The reason that we have not sent invitation to Taiwan was due to
a delicate situation between China and Taiwan.  However, today we
agreed finally to send an official invitation to Taiwan to join this 
new organization.  I apologize for this delay, but please understand
it.

I am writing you two things.

1) For details, such as Bylaws, please contact Hide Sakai who was
   selected a chair of this ANPhA today.  He could provide more
   detailed information.  We need to have one person as a Board
   member from Taiwan, if you can agree on it.

2) I would like to include this news in the article in the AAPPS.
   Please also contact Hide Sakai on this issue as well.

Again, sorry that we were not able to send an invitation to you by
this time. We should plan how nuclear physics goes in Asian countries.
The next meeting will be held in Japan near Tokai where we are 
operating J-PARC.

                                 Best regards,  Shoji Nagamiya
