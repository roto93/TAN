**********************************************************************
Dear colleagues,

We are pleased to announce that 2009 TIARA workshop on AGN and Star
Formation will be held at NTHU, Nov 16-20, 2009. The theme of this
workshop is motivated in the general context of interaction between
AGN activities and their environments. We would like to address
pressing problems in the general context related to star formation
processes. The emphasis of this workshop will be on discussions rather
than formal presentations. Hence we envision several talks per day,
with the rest of the time devoted to informal discussions and working
sessions.

We are looking forward to seeing you at NTHU.

Regards,
Albert Kong (NTHU/TIARA)
Kinwah Wu (MSSL, UCL),
Ronald Taam (Northwestern University/TIARA)
