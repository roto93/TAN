Dear Colleague,

We would be grateful if you forward the following research opportunity
announcement for grant-funded Guest Observations using the Kepler spacecraft
among interested scientists within your department. The printed PDF document
is suitable for doors, notice boards and coffee tables.
[The PDF file is too large to be included.  YJK]

With regards and thanks,

Dear Yi-Jehng

Please circulate this to the TAN community.  Thanks.

Dear Fellow Astronomers in Taiwan

Our community has grown tremendously in the last decade.  With many 
challenging projects in hand, we should execute strategically and plan 
whatever initiatives carefully.  It is therefore high time that we 
gathered to talk about how to maximize resources.  In the last PSROC 
Executive Meeting, I was charted the mission to call upon such a meeting.

The concept of a "national observatory" has been brought up occasionally 
in the past few years, but no concrete census was reached, partly because 
the discussions have been on an ad-hoc basis.  Everyone of us, as an 
individual or a member of a particular institute, may have something to 
say about this issue.  There are sure many possibilities, with different 
kinds of boundary conditions.

It has been proposed that we have a meeting together with the Physics 
Society meeting which will take place Feb 2-4, 2010 in National Cheng-Kung 
University in Tainan.  A window of opportunity is the evening of Feb 4, 
but it will be too short.  So I propose Feb 5, the day after the Physics 
meeting, for a half-day meeting.  I hope you will stay in Tainan for one 
more day for us to exchange ideas.

** Date/Time: Morning of Feb 5, Friday, 2010
** Place: NCKU (exact location TBA)


Regards,

Wen Ping

Hi Yi-jehng

There will a solar-system workshop two weeks from now at NCU, as the 
message by Wing below indicated.  Could you please circulate this on TAN 
to a possible larger attendance?

Thanks.

Wen Ping

Dear All,

Dr. Steve Strom from NOAO is visiting from 11/23 for a week and he will give a talk on
Tuesday (11/24) entitled

           "The Evolution of Circumstellar Disks: 
            What Kinds of Planets Form in What Kinds of Disks?"

Please mark your calendar and remember to join the event. 

Apart from being a professional astronomer, Dr. Strom is also a photographer. 
His exhibition will be held at Taipei Astronomical Museum until 12/17. Below is Dr.
Strom's website for photography:

Hi Shou-Huang,

We are getting settled down in the new building.  Not everything is
ready but it is progressing well.

I believe the Taiwan Astronomy Network is the best place for
you to spread the information.  I had cc this email to TAN as well.

Cheers,
Wei-Hao

> Title: Witnessing the formation and evolution of massive galaxies
>
> Abstract:
> Understanding the formation of the most massive galaxies that are the
> brightest, biggest and yet elusive objects in the Universe is topic
> that deeply puzzles and interests Astronomers today. While the
> large-scale structure and cosmological properties are globally
> understood, the mass assembly and star-formation in the massive
> systems continues to challenge existing models. As the large-scale
> behaviour of galaxies is ruled by their dark matter content, an
> estimate of the mass of their dark matter halos is crucial to gain a
> good understanding of the history of their mass assembly.
>
> Panchromatic deep and large near-infrared surveys, such as the
> UKIDSS-UDS and AEGIS-POWIR surveys, are the ideal tools to study
> distant massive galaxies.  I will present briefly the deepest of
> these surveys, the Ultra-Deep Survey (UDS) which covers 0.6 sq degrees
> for a depth of the current world-wide available release of K=21.3, H=22.0,
> J=22.5 (Vega).
>
> I will introduce the most recent work I am leading thanks to these
> near-infrared surveys, to describe the properties of massive galaxies
> at 1<z<2 and derive conclusions on the formation and evolution of the
> most massive galaxies found since the early age of our universe.
>
> I will in a first part, focus on the building of the red sequence, and show
> that red (passive) galaxies were formed very early in are located in the most
> massive early-formed Dark-Matter Halos.
>
> Finally, I will show that by studying the correlation
> function of massive galaxies selected from their stellar masses and
> comparing it with biased formation models, I can demonstrate that very
> massive galaxies at high redshift inhabit very massive dark matter halos
> and hence are the potential progenitors of very massive elliptical
> galaxies in local groups.  I also will demonstrate that the
> stellar-dark matter mass ratio decrease in more massive systems,
> implying a dependency of the star formation efficiency with their
> environment.
