Dear colleagues:

We are pleased to announce that "Focus Week on the Epoch of Reionization"
will be held at the Institute for the Physics and Mathematics of the
Universe, November 30 - December 3, 2009. The purpose of this meeting
is to bring top scientists from Subaru, LOFAR, MWA, GMRT together
with theorists in high-redshift galaxies and cosmic reionization.
A preliminary schedule is attached below.
Time will be provided for in-depth discussions of several important
topics in addition to the review, invited, and contributed talks.
Further information can be found at

http://web.ipmu.jp/seminar/EoR/

We have open slots for 15 minutes contributed talks.
We encourage young scientists to apply for it.

To attend to the meeting and to register,
please email to naoki.yoshida@ipmu.jp
with your name, affiliation and email address.

We look forward to seeing you in Kashiwa!
