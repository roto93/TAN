Dear Fellow Astronomers in Taiwan

Our community has grown tremendously in the last decade.  With many
challenging projects in hand, we should execute strategically and plan
whatever initiatives carefully.  It is therefore high time that we gathered
to talk about how to maximize resources.  In the last PSROC Executive
Meeting, I was charted the mission to call upon such a meeting.

The concept of a "national observatory" has been brought up occasionally in
the past few years, but no concrete census was reached, partly because the
discussions have been on an ad-hoc basis.  Everyone of us, as an individual
or a member of a particular institute, may have something to say about this
issue.  There are sure many possibilities, with different kinds of boundary
conditions.

It has been proposed that we have a meeting together with the Physics
Society meeting which will take place Feb 2-4, 2010 in National Cheng-Kung
University in Tainan.  A window of opportunity is the evening of Feb 4, but
it will be too short.  So I propose Feb 5, the day after the Physics
meeting, for a half-day meeting.  I hope you will stay in Tainan for one
more day for us to exchange ideas.

** Date/Time: Morning of Feb 5, Friday, 2010
** Place: NCKU (exact location TBA)


Regards,

Wen Ping
