Dear Yi-Jehng, 

Could you please post the message about Solar System Working Group of 
HSC project to the TAN network? 

Thank you, 

Daisuke

HSC (Hyper Suprime-Cam) is a next generation wide-field camera for 
8.2-m Subaru telescope at the summit of Mauna Kea. HSC project is an 
international effort by 3 partners, Japan, Princeton University, and 
Taiwan. 

HSC is designed to have 1.5 deg. field-of-view. The project is going 
to apply 300 nights over 5 years starting in 2012. Although, the weak 
lensing and galaxy evolution are two big scientific objectives, we can 
do other sciences as well. 

Until yesterday, we had Japan-Princeton-Taiwan HSC workshop here in 
Tokyo. Japanese group has been discussed survey parameters, such as 
area, depth, cadence, under the framework of "wide", "deep", 
"ultra-deep" survey modes, but now the structure is re-organized. 10 
science-oriented working groups are formed. These working groups will 
summarize the science drivers and observation requirements until May 
2009. 

For solar system sciences, Dr. Yoshida Fumi at National Astronomical 
Observatory of Japan is the coordinator for Solar System Working 
Group. If you are interested in using the HSC data for solar system 
sciences, you definitely need to join the discussion in the working 
group. I was asked to compile a list of names and e-mail addresses of 
Taiwanese astronomers who is willing to join the Solar System Working 
Group for HSC. 

Please let me (Kinoshita Daisuke, kinoshita@astro.ncu.edu.tw) know 
your name and e-mail address if you are interested in joining the HSC 
Solar System Working Group. Then, I pass the list of Taiwanese 
astronomers to Dr. Yoshida. 

Thank you, 

Daisuke
