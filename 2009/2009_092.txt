Dear Colleagues:

     I'm using the hep and astro nets to announce the formation of a 
Nuclear Physics Association - many physics sub-fields in Taiwan still do 
not have their own networks.

     Keep tuned on what's going on on this Asian Nuclear Physics 
Association.

                                           Best wishes, Pauchy

Dear Pauchy:

Nuclear Physics communities in Asia spent almost a year to prepare
ANPhA (Asian Nuclear Physics Association) and, finally, started today
as an official organization.

We had meetings among China, Korea and Japan and created Bylaws.  
We are still inviting new members from Australia, India, Taiwan, etc.
The reason that we have not sent invitation to Taiwan was due to
a delicate situation between China and Taiwan.  However, today we
agreed finally to send an official invitation to Taiwan to join this 
new organization.  I apologize for this delay, but please understand
it.

I am writing you two things.

1) For details, such as Bylaws, please contact Hide Sakai who was
   selected a chair of this ANPhA today.  He could provide more
   detailed information.  We need to have one person as a Board
   member from Taiwan, if you can agree on it.

2) I would like to include this news in the article in the AAPPS.
   Please also contact Hide Sakai on this issue as well.

 Hideyuki Sakai at sakai@phys.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp

Again, sorry that we were not able to send an invitation to you by
this time. We should plan how nuclear physics goes in Asian countries.
The next meeting will be held in Japan near Tokai where we are 
operating J-PARC.

                                 Best regards,  Shoji Nagamiya

Dear all,

Next week there will be three colloquium talks. Dr. Marc Kuchner from NASA Goddard Space
Flight Center and Professor Charles Liu from American Museum of Natural History will
stop by IAA next week. Dr. Marc Kuchner's talk is on Monday (7/27) and the title is 

"Reading the Signatures of Extrasolar Planets in Debris Disks".

And on Tuesday (7/28) Professor Charles Liu is going to present a
talk on

"Galaxy Evolution At The Faint End Of The Luminosity Function"

Also on Friday (7/31) Dr. Makoto Inoue, IAA's new Distinguished Research Fellow will
present the first part of a "VLBI in ASIAA" series:  

"Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) in ASIAA (part I)"

The 2nd talk of the series will be presented by Dr. Keiichi Asada (IAA) the week next. 

Please mark your calendar and remember to join the events.
