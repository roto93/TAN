Information about the PhD program:
         http://www.strw.leidenuniv.nl/education/PhD.php

Leiden Observatory invites applications for more than ten PhD positions.

The four-year PhD program consists mostly of research under the supervision of
one or more faculty members. Positions are available in all the research areas
in which the Observatory is active. These include cosmology, galaxy formation
and evolution, interstellar matter and star formation, stars and planetary
systems, computational astrophysics, high energy astrophysics, laboratory
astrophysics, astrochemistry, and instrumentation. More information about
research at Leiden Observatory can be found at
http://www.strw.leidenuniv.nl/research/

Leiden Observatory, founded in 1633, is the oldest university astronomy
department in the world. With about 25 faculty, over 30 postdoctoral associates
and over 40 PhD students it is the largest astronomy department in the
Netherlands. Leiden is a charming university town with international flair.
Most Leiden researchers have an international background. English is the
common language.

During their thesis, Leiden PhD students are paid as civil servants, which
means that they earn competitive salaries (the current gross salary, including
allowances, increases from about EUR 28,000 in year 1 to about EUR 36,000 in
year 4) and are eligible for both social security and retirement benefits.
PhD positions are funded for four years.

Application forms and instructions are available at
http://www.strw.leidenuniv.nl/phd/
Applicants are requested to upload a curriculum vitae, a list of all university
courses taken and transcripts of grades obtained, brief statements of research
interests and experience, and the contact information for at least two referees.

The successful candidates must have a MSc degree (or equivalent) by the
starting date. The starting dates are negotiable.

Complete applications received by December 15, 2009 will receive full
consideration.

The positions are open to candidates from all countries. The research will be
carried out in the framework of the Netherlands Research School for Astronomy
(NOVA). More information about the PhD program at Leiden Observatory can be
found at http://www.strw.leidenuniv.nl/phd/

> Subject: PhD positions in the Netherlands

Dear Colleague, 

More than 20 PhD positions will be available in astronomy in the 
coming year in the context of the Netherlands Research School for 
Astronomy (NOVA). NOVA is a federation of the astronomical institutes 
of the universities of Amsterdam, Groningen, Leiden, Nijmegen and 
Utrecht.  Topics include the formation and evolution of galaxies, the 
formation of stars and planetary systems, exo-planets, the 
astrophysics of compact objects, astroparticle physics and laboratory 
astrophysics.  Astronomers in the Netherlands have access to 
state-of-the-art telescopes and space observatories around the world. 

The Netherlands has an internationally acknowledged reputation for 
research and education in astronomy.  The PhD program is 4 yr, during 
which the PhD students are appointed as civil servants and earn a 
competitive salary. Individual projects can be found through 
www.nova-astronomy.nl/application. Deadlines vary per project and 
institute but can be as early as December 15 2009.  A Masters degree 
(or equivalent) in astronomy or a related field is required. 

Can you please distribute this information to suitable candidates? 

Thank you in advance, 

Sincerely, 

Prof. dr. E.F. van Dishoeck 
Scientific Director, NOVA

Dear colleagues,

We are pleased to announce that 2009 TIARA workshop on AGN and Star
Formation will be held at NTHU, Nov 16-20, 2009. The theme of this
workshop is motivated in the general context of interaction between
AGN activities and their environments. We would like to address
pressing problems in the general context related to star formation
processes. The emphasis of this workshop will be on discussions rather
than formal presentations. Hence we envision several talks per day,
with the rest of the time devoted to informal discussions and working
sessions.

We are looking forward to seeing you at NTHU.

Regards,
Albert Kong (NTHU/TIARA)
Kinwah Wu (MSSL, UCL),
Ronald Taam (Northwestern University/TIARA)
