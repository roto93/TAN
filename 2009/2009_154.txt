 Subject: Re: The First APCosPA Winter School

                                         December 29, 2009
Dear Colleagues:

     I apologize that the pace for the organization of the 1st APcosPA 
Winter School is somewhat slow - but in a good progress. At this point, we 
anticipate that there are about 10 "students" (senoir graduate students, 
young postdocs, etc.) from China (Beida, Fudan, etc.), 6 from South Korea, 
a few from Japan, two from Australia, and one from New Zealand. The 
domestic participation is limited to about 30. We would like to choose, at 
the end of the program, a few "students" for awards. This message is 
intended so that you would encourage your best "students" to participate 
this competition, with the deadline to register as 5 January 2010.
 
     Happy New Year !!                Best wishes, Pauchy
