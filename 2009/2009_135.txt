Hi Shou-Huang,

We are getting settled down in the new building.  Not everything is
ready but it is progressing well.

I believe the Taiwan Astronomy Network is the best place for
you to spread the information.  I had cc this email to TAN as well.

Cheers,
Wei-Hao

> Title: Witnessing the formation and evolution of massive galaxies
>
> Abstract:
> Understanding the formation of the most massive galaxies that are the
> brightest, biggest and yet elusive objects in the Universe is topic
> that deeply puzzles and interests Astronomers today. While the
> large-scale structure and cosmological properties are globally
> understood, the mass assembly and star-formation in the massive
> systems continues to challenge existing models. As the large-scale
> behaviour of galaxies is ruled by their dark matter content, an
> estimate of the mass of their dark matter halos is crucial to gain a
> good understanding of the history of their mass assembly.

> Panchromatic deep and large near-infrared surveys, such as the
> UKIDSS-UDS and AEGIS-POWIR surveys, are the ideal tools to study
> distant massive galaxies.  I will present briefly the deepest of
> these surveys, the Ultra-Deep Survey (UDS) which covers 0.6 sq degrees
> for a depth of the current world-wide available release of K=21.3, H=22.0,
> J=22.5 (Vega).
>
> I will introduce the most recent work I am leading thanks to these
> near-infrared surveys, to describe the properties of massive galaxies
> at 1<z<2 and derive conclusions on the formation and evolution of the
> most massive galaxies found since the early age of our universe.
>
> I will in a first part, focus on the building of the red sequence, and show
> that red (passive) galaxies were formed very early in are located in the most
> massive early-formed Dark-Matter Halos.
>
> Finally, I will show that by studying the correlation
> function of massive galaxies selected from their stellar masses and
> comparing it with biased formation models, I can demonstrate that very
> massive galaxies at high redshift inhabit very massive dark matter halos
> and hence are the potential progenitors of very massive elliptical
> galaxies in local groups.  I also will demonstrate that the
> stellar-dark matter mass ratio decrease in more massive systems,
> implying a dependency of the star formation efficiency with their
> environment.
