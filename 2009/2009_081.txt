Subject: Mini-workshop on Magnetic Field @ NTHU-TIARA (June 23-24)

Dear all,

We would like to invite you to attend a mini-workshop on magnetic
field at the Institute of Astronomy, National Tsing Hua University on
June 23-24 (Tue-Wed). The purpose of this informal workshop is to
gather people working on magnetic field related research and to
exchange idea. We will feature a couple of overview talks by Kinwah Wu
who is the Chair of Theoretical Astrophysics and Head of Theory in
Mullard Space Science Lab, University College London. The schedule of
the talks is as follow:

June 23

2pm  Radiative and dynamical processes in magnetically interacting
two-body systems (1hr+discussion), Kinwah Wu

3:15pm  High energy emission from rapidly rotating neutron-star
magnetospheres, Kouichi Hirotani (30min+discussion)

4pm Probing the pulsar wind in gamma-ray binary (30min+discussion),
Jumpei Takata

June 24

2pm  Cosmic magnetism --- a pedestrian's perspective (1hr+discussion), Kinwah Wu

3:15pm  Zooming in on the magnetic field structure around a protostar
(30min+discussion), Shih-Ping Lai

4pm  Vibrations of neutron stars promoted by frozen-in magnetic field
(30min+discussion), Sergey Bastrukov

All the talks will take place at NTHU-TIARA (8F, 2nd General Bld). ALL
are welcome.

Cheers,
Albert
