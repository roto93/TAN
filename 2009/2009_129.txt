Astrophysics Faculty Position Department of Physics and Astronomy Johns 
Hopkins University

The Department of Physics and Astronomy of the Johns Hopkins University 
invites applications for a faculty position in astrophysics.  We will 
consider applicants in all subfields of astrophysics. We expect that this 
appointment will be made at the level of assistant professor, but 
appointments at a higher level may be possible in exceptional cases. 
Current faculty members are active in theory, developing astronomical 
instrumentation (particularly for space-based platforms), observational 
astronomy across a wide range of wavelengths, and data intensive science. 
Research interests of the current faculty members include planetary 
science, extra-solar planets, the interstellar medium, stellar 
populations, high-energy astrophysics, active galaxies, galaxy formation 
and evolution, and cosmology.  Johns Hopkins is a member of the Sloan 
Digital Sky Survey and Pan-STARRS 1 projects, owns a share of the Apache 
Point Observatory 3.5m telescope, is the home of the WMAP and Advanced 
Camera for Surveys teams, and is an institutional member in the GALEX 
mission. We are playing a leading role in the National Virtual 
Observatory.  We cooperate closely with the adjacent Space Telescope 
Science Institute, the JHU Applied Physics Laboratory, and NASA's Goddard 
Space Flight Center.

Applicants should submit a curriculum vitae, list of publications, and 
short description of research plans as PDF attachments to 
astrosearch@pha.jhu.edu and also arrange to have three letters of 
reference e-mailed by reviewers to the same address.  Mail may be 
addressed to: Astrophysics Search Committee, c/o Ms. Pam Carmen, 
Department of Physics and Astronomy, Johns Hopkins University, 3400 North 
Charles St., Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.  Consideration of applications will 
begin on December 1, and will continue until the position is filled. 
Hopkins is an affirmative action/equal opportunity employer, and welcomes 
applications from women and members of underrepresented groups.
