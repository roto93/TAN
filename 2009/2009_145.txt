                       2010 Star Formation Workshop
Massive Star Formation: Observations, Theory and Diagnostic Tools 

                            January 11-14, 2010 

Hosted by Astronomy Department, University of California, Berkeley 
                              Co-sponsored by 
       Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA) 
and The Theoretical Institute for Advanced Research in Astrophysics (TIARA) 

--------------------------------------------------------------------

The Astronomy Department, University of California, Berkeley will host a
Star Formation Workshop: Observations, Theories, and Diagnostic Tools from
January 11th-14th, 2010, on the campus of UCB. The Academia Sinica Institute
of Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA) and its Theoretical Institute for
Advanced Research for Astrophysics (TIARA), Taiwan, are co-sponsoring the
event. The workshop will take place at 106 Stanley Hall.

The theme of the workshop will be on the formation of the massive stars from
small to large scales, their observations, theories, and diagnostic tools.
Topics include theories of the formation, initial conditions, cloud cores,
accretion mechanisms, disks and outflows, magnetic fields, radiative transfer
tools, simulations, and connections to larger scales. Each of the talks is
scheduled for 30 minutes, followed by 15 minutes of questions and discussions.
Close interactions and lively discussions among the speakers and the
participants are the primary goals of the workshop. Participation in the entire
workshop is strongly recommended.
