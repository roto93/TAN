astrophysicists in Taiwan to demonstrate their most recent discoveries and
observations, to report their latest research results and to exchange ideas,
also to organize cooperation when desirable. Oral presentations and conference
posters in all areas of astronomy and astrophysics are solicited. ASROC2009 is
an excellent venue, too, for students, in particular graduate students, to
present their research finding or progress from their thesis studies.

The meeting will include plenary talks, scientific sessions, poster presentation
a business meeting, and an educational symposium. The plenary talks feature
(1) Prof. Geoffrey Marcy, the world-renowned exoplanet finder, of University
California - Berkeley, and (2) Dr. Shoken Miyama, the director of National
Astronomical Observatory, Japan. Additionally, special events are being prepared
for to celebrate the 400th anniversary of the first use of an astronomical

In coordination with the International Year of Astronomy (IYA2009) activities to
celebrate and promote astronomy, exhibitions of astronomical books and
instruments, astrophotographs and individuals' observing equipment will be held
at this ASROC assembly for amateur astronomers and the general public.
Furthermore, an exhibition of Taiwan's existing and/or future major astronomical
facilities and projects is also planned. In addition, stargazing carnival
participated by the Ken-Ting Observatory (KTO) and amateur astronomers for the
general public will be taken place in the evenings during the meeting. Further
details will be announced in the 2nd circular.
