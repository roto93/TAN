Dear TAN subscribers,

Because the main server machine of TAN at ASIAA crashed sometime last week
(Feb 26-27), we will be using the TAN backup host machine at Shida
(castor.scc.ntnu.edu.tw) from now on until the server at ASIAA is fixed.
And messages sent to TAN during this time (Feb 26 - Mar 01) may have lost.
However, this may take a while to resolve the problem.  By the mean time,
submission of news or annuncement to TAN can still be sent to
astro@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw as before.

Sorry for any inconvenience may have caused.

Yi-Jehng Kuan
TAN administrator
