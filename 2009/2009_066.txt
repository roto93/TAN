Dear Dr. Yi-Jehng Kuan 

I am writing to let you know about a new SETI Institute initiative 
called "Earth Speaks." We are gathering messages that people would want 
to communicate to extraterrestrial intelligence. Our goal is to make 
this a global project, so would welcome messages from you and your 
friends and colleagues throughout Taiwan. 

For more on the project, and to submit your messages, please see: 

http://earthspeaks.seti.org 

I hope you and your family are well. 

Best, 
Doug

Hi Yi-Jehng,

Due to some technical issue of the IoA main page just before the
holiday, we set up a mirror page so that people can access the
information of our summer student program. Please circulate the
information below through TAN. Thanks.

Cheers,
Albert
