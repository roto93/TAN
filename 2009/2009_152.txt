All,

The search for a Senior Project Manager for the Dark Energy Survey Data
Management effort is now open and I'd like to ask for your help in
advertising the opportunity and reaching out to high-quality candidates.
This is a critical position on the DESDM team and one with significant
opportunities in many directions for the right candidate. The position is
advertised on the NCSA website at the URL below as well as on the U.
Illinois job board. It will be advertised via Physics Today and AAS online
services soon if it is not already up. I've included the announcement
below and would ask you to forward this note as you see fit to potential
candidates. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.
(Please note that while the listed deadline is Jan 8th, we will consider

leadership for the development and implementation of the
<http://cosmology.illinois.edu/DES/> Dark Energy Survey (DES) Data
Management (DM) System. The DES is an international project developing a
new astronomical camera and astronomical analysis capabilities with the
goal of further elucidating the nature of "dark energy," the source of an
observed repulsive force in the universe. The project will be responsible
for managing hundreds of terabytes of observational data and disseminating
roughly 1 petabyte of data products to the community. This position will
also be responsible to the project principal investigator for refining
high-level plans into detailed work specifications, providing daily
management of development staff, managing risks and administering change
control policies, helping to translate scientific requirements into
appropriate cyberinfrastructure development, overseeing project reporting
activities and having the overall responsibility to ensure that staff and
resources are appropriately directed.

Required Education and Experience:

.         MS degree in Astronomy, Physics, Computer Science, Systems
Engineering, or related field required (PhD preferred). Alternative degree
fields will be considered/accepted if accompanied by equivalent experience
(depending on nature and depth of experience as it relates to current NCSA
technologies).

.         3 or more years experience in project management.

.         Experience in developing and executing long-range and
short-range plans and schedules.

Preferred Experience:

.         Experience in the management of large-scale facility development
or large-scale scientific software development efforts as well as in
multidisciplinary and distributed projects/teams.

.         Experience with large scale data processing, high performance
computing workflows, large databases, astronomy, and/or image processing.

This is a regular academic professional position at NCSA and is a
renewable 12/12, 100%-time appointment with regular University benefits.
Salary is commensurate with experience and start date will be as soon as
possible after the close date of the search. Interviews may be conducted
before the closing date, although no hiring decisions will be made until
after the search has closed.
