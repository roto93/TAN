Title :   Pre-Biologically Important Interstellar Molecules

Speaker:  Prof. Yi-Jehng Kuan
          (National Taiwan Normal University)

Date:    6 December 2002 (Friday)

Time:    12:10
Place:   Room 620,  Physics Building, NTHU

Abstract:
Understanding the organic chemistry of molecular clouds, particularly
the formation of biologically important molecules, is fundamental to
the study of the processes which lead to the origin, evolution and
distribution of life in the Galaxy.  Determining the level of molecular
complexity attainable in the clouds, and the nature of the complex
organic material available to protostellar disks and the planetary
systems that form from them, requires an understanding of the possible
chemical pathways and is therefore a central question in astrochemistry.
Although many organics can be produced in gas phase reactions, reactions
on the surfaces of cold interstellar dust grains are probably the major
source of complex organic material.  Gas phase observations of hot 
molecular cores, where icy grain mantles have recently been evaporated,
offer the prospect of studying the products of grain surface chemistry
directly.  We have thus searched for pre-biologically important molecules
in the hot molecular cloud cores: Sgr B2(N-LMH), W51 e1/e2 and Orion-KL.
Detections of these organic molecules in the interstellar space will have
important implications for Astrobiology.  Some of our results will be 
presented.

Subject: The First Taiwan Winter School on Modern Biophysics

Dear Colleagues:

     We will have an exciting winter school coming up for all the
biophysics or bionano go-ers. We have invited Paul Higgs, Henri Orland,
Paul Hansma, Tony Zee, all famous bio guys, as our foreign lectuers.

     The session will start on 2 p.m. at our auditorium (204) and late
registration will be handled during 1:00-2:00 p.m. We encourage you to
register early especially if you need hotel accommodations or wish to join
us for the reception party (Monday) or the banquet (Wednesday). 

     Other sessions: Full day on 12/17 & 12/18 but with a long lunch
                     break. Half day, 12/19 p.m. & 12/20 a.m.

                         Best wishes to you all, W-Y. Pauchy Hwang
