Something to circulate....thanks....Wen Ping Chen

Call for Observing Proposal --- Lulin 1 m 

The shakedown and adjustment of the Lulin 1 m telescope, installed in
early September, has been complete, and we are happy to annouce the
opportunity to use it for project observations starting January 2003.  
Broadband and narrowband CCD imaging data of asteroids, star clusters, 
and variable stars have been collected during the testing months, and 
the overall performance either matchs or exceeds the specs.  You are
encouraged to contact the NCU staff or <wchen@astro,ncu.edu.tw> for
inquiries.   Request for time for the 2003 January-March season is due 
December 15.  For an observing time request form, check out
