Dear friends,

Happy New Year!

We will have a radio astronomy conference in Xi'an between
July 18-25th. The conference cover all aspects on radio
astronomy. It is the China-Germany biliteral conference
but also functions as a China national meeting on radio
astronomy. However, we make the conference open to you,
and invite you to participate. Would you please visit
meeting homepage

and see if you are free during that period. We wish you 
to have (more) cooperations with Chinese colleagues and
have a hot discussion your projects going-on. If possible,
we hope you can give a review talk or a long lecture if
you could come for the meeting.

Please contact with me if you have any questions. We will
send you formal invitation when you decide to come.

With Best Wishes,
JinLin Han
