Dear Colleagues,

We are very pleased to announce IAU Colloquium 193 "Variable stars in the
Local Group" to be held in Christchurch, New Zealand from 6-11 July 2003.

This conference will immediately precede the IAU General Assembly to be
held nearby (3 hour flight) in Sydney, Australia (www.astronomy2003.com)
and will thus allow researchers to attend both meetings easily.

The title and major theme of this meeting is stellar variability in the
Local Group and it follows by two years the highly successful Leuven
pulsation IAU colloquium. The theories of stellar structure and evolution
underpin all of stellar, galactic and extra-galactic astrophysics, so it
is appropriate that astronomers working in stellar pulsation meet
biennially to discuss advances in our field - from the structure of
crystallized white dwarf cores to the complex 3D interactions of AGB
stars with their envelopes in pre-planetary nebulae stages; from main
sequence p-mode and g-mode pulsators to exotic cases of tidally driven
variability; from the basic microscopic physics of astrophysical plasmas,
such as equations of state, opacities and radiative diffusion, to the
complex hydrodynamical phenomena of convection and circulation which
determine the chemical constitution of stars.

The Local Group offers samples of all classes of variable stars, generally
with good information about distance and chemical composition from the
membership of the stars in various components of the Group. It provides
an environment in which we can study individual stars without the large
uncertainties in their distances that often plagues Galactic studies.
This is an essential stepping stone between the detailed understanding
of individual stars and the broader understanding of populations in
more distant galaxies. Eclipsing binary star distance determinations
in the Local Group will be contrasted with the results from the pulsating
star technique.

With the recent dramatic advances in the observational material from the
new generation of large telescopes and the availability of large-scale
surveys, this provides an excellent opportunity for testing our
theoretical understanding of these stars and for generating discussion of
the implications and applications of stellar variability. The proposed
Colloquium is expected to yield substantial advances in these areas.

The conference will cover the following major topics:

-  What variable stars tell us about the Local Group
-  Variable stars as tracers of different stellar populations
   (including galactic and globular clusters, LMC/SMC clusters and local
   group galaxies)
-  Early type stars: B, A and F pulsators
-  Binary stars and pulsation
-  Red Giants, Miras, post-AGB stars and proto-planetary nebulae
-  Chemical composition of variable stars
-  New theoretical developments in stellar pulsation/variability
-  Evolutionary and pulsation properties of variable stars
-  Our future in Space

Presentations will include invited reviews, contributed talks and poster
papers. The second announcement and the call for scientific papers will be
sent out in December 2002.

Invited speakers include: J. Christensen-Dalsgaard (Denmark),
A. Aparicio (Spain), K. Stanek (USA), A. Udalski (Poland), M. Catelan
(Chile), H. Habing (Netherlands), P. De Cat (Belgium), L. Bigot (France),
E. Guinan (USA), B. Willems (UK), T. Tanabe (Japan), M. Feast (S. Africa),
S. Vauclair (France), G. Fontaine (Canada), D. Dearborn (USA),
S. Cassisi (Italy), W. Lawson (Australia), J. Matthews (Canada),
C. Catala (France), S. Kawaler (USA).

The conference will be held on the campus of the University of Canterbury,
in the city of Christchurch.  Christchurch is the largest city in New
Zealand's South Island and offers many places of interest including museums,
an international Antarctic Centre, excellent botanical gardens and
numerous restaurants and cafes. Christchurch is ideally situated for
day-length activities including skiing, whale watching, bungy jumping, jet
boating and wine tours. The majestic Southern Alps are only a 1.5 hour
drive from Christchurch and offer some of the best ski-fields in New
Zealand.

The Christchurch climate is temperate, with a mean temperature range for
July of 2 - 12 C -- the days are likely to be cool, clear and sunny,
although some rain is also probable at this time of year. (For further

We also ask you to pass on this message to any of your colleagues who
recently entered the field of stellar variability and may therefore not
yet be in our mailing list or to anyone who you think might be interested
in attending the meeting.

We look forward to seeing you in Christchurch next year!
