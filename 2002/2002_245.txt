Title: Prebiologically Important Interstellar Molecules


Abstract:

Understanding the organic chemistry of molecular clouds, particularly the
formation of biologically important molecules, is fundamental to the study
of the processes which lead to the origin, evolution and distribution of
life in the Galaxy. Determining the level of molecular complexity attainable
in the clouds, and the nature of the complex organic material available to
protostellar disks and the planetary systems that form from them, requires
an understanding of the possible chemical pathways and is therefore a central
question in Astrochemistry.  Although many organics can be produced in gas
phase reactions, reactions on the surfaces of cold interstellar dust grains
are probably the major source of  complex  organic  material.  Gas phase
millimeter-wave observations of hot molecular cores, where icy grain mantles
have recently been evaporated, offer the prospect of studying the products of
grain surface chemistry directly.  We have thus searched in Sgr B2(N-LMH),
W51 e1/e2 and Orion-KL for prebiologically important molecules Pyrimidine,
2H-Azirine, Aziridine and Glycine.  Detections of these organic molecules in
the interstellar space will have important implications for Astrobiology.
Some of our results will be presented.

Dear Yi-Jehng Kuan,

    Hope you are fine.

    I am Athar Husain, currently working as an assistant prof of
    NCTS in Hsinchu.  As you know, NCTS has two campuses. My office
    is in NCTU campus of NCTS.

    My present main field of reseach interest is high energy
    (neutrino) astrophysics.  Further details of my recent works in
    this direction are given at my home page
    (whose address is given at the end of this mail).

    Though, this field has yet to become an experimental science topic,
    but even at its initial stages of development, it carries a lot of
    potential interest both from astrophysicists and particle physicists.

    In this context, you may be interested in adding my following email
        athar@phys.cts.nthu.edu.tw
    in TAN and announcing the following interesting Workshop which I
    with Guey-Lin Lin (NCTU) and Kingman Cheung (NCTS) are organizing:

    Second NCTS Workshop on Astroparticle Physics
    16-18 January, 2003
    Lung-Tan

    http://phys.cts.nthu.edu.tw/workshop/tp4/20030116/index.all.htm

    Though, the last date for registration is formally over and we have
    already a reasonable number of participants but I still encourge all
    interested ones, particularly graduate students and post docs
    to contact us for participation as soon as possible.


sincerely
athar
