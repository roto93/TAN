Abstract:

The Taiwanese-American Occultation Survey (TAOS) is a program dedicated
to performing a survey of small objects (< 10 km) in the trans-Neptunian
Region of the Solar System by detecting the occultations of bright
stars by these objects.  This survey must deal with the low expected
event rate, marginal signal to noise of detections at one telescope,
and the possibility of a high false detection rate due to atmospheric
fluctuations or other terrestrial phenomena.
I'll give a brief introduction to the Kuiper Belt and TAOS project.  
General idea and problems on the detection of occultation events will
be presented.   An ideal occultation survey can be designed through 
the analysis using Kirchhoff diffraction theory and numerical simulation, 
The general approach will be shown, though, the final result is yet to
be worked out.
