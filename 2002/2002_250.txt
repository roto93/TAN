       University of Missouri-Columbia, USA

    Title : The Black Hole in the Center of our
               Milky Way
 
 Abstract:
 
A black hole is an object which is so closely packed that no particle
nor any light can be emitted from the black hole. Matter or light
which falls in can never get out again, provided quantum effects can
be neglected. --- We first discuss the notion of a black hole and then
turn our attention to the object Sagittarius A* in the center of our
Milky Way which has about 2 million solar masses. We describe how its
mass
is determined by using the infrared visible Kepler orbits of
stars circling around Sgr A* (see the figure) and then collect the
evidence which shows that Sgr A* has to be a black hole.
