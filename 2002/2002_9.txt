      34th CONFERENCE of EUROPEAN GROUP for ATOMIC SPECTROSCOPY
                               EGAS 34
                        Sofia, 9-12 July 2002


                         FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT





    SCIENTIFIC PROGRAM
 The scientific program of EGAS 34 will cover all aspects of spectra of simple and complicate atoms, 
ions (including highly charged) and small molecules; atomic constants and application in astrophysics.
 The Conference will be focused to the rapid progress of quantum optics, laser manipulation of atoms, 
cooling and trapping of atoms and molecules, Bose-Einstein condensate, atomic lasers, laser 
spectroscopy, generation of ultrashort EM pulses, and application of quantum optics in metrology.
 Special attention will be paid to the atomic spectroscopy aspects of low and high temperature plasma 
and application to light sources. 
The experimental methods and instrumentation will be discussed.
