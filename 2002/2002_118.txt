Dear TANists,

Some complaints to TAN were received past week for not announcing the now 
passed Star Formation Workshop 2002, which was held in Taipei and Taroko in 
June 12-17.  I apologize for not sending out the announcement through TAN
which I should have.  But still, if you would like to find out more about 
the past event, please go to http://sf2002.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/.  Sorry
again.

***************************************************************************

The scientific program has been updated, since the last circular. The
program, which is still tentative, is attached at the end. It is also
posted on the homepage.

In addition to talks, three events are planned:
 
Informal  Reception on June 23 (Sunday) 6:00pm - Participants will be gathered at
      the lobby of Yongildae Hotel. Dinner will be pre-arranged in
      a local restaurant.

  Conference Dinner on June 26 (Wednesday) 6:30 at Yongildae Hotel.
       The cost of dinner is 20,000 KRW (10,000 KRW for students). 
       There is no charge for conference dinner who paid the registration fee.

  Kyongju Tour on June 27 (Thursday) Afternoon - The tour will be lead by
      Prof. Yong-Bok Lee, who is an expert of Korean ancient astronomy and
      history. This tour is free of charge.

Accommodation:
  Accommodations have been arranged in three different places: Yongildae (Hilton) 
  Hotel, Faculty Apartment, and Sangnam Guest House. Each participant will receive 
  a separate mail about his/her accommodation after this circular. The accommodation
  assignment is also posted in our webpage (http://www-kas.or.kr/kaw2/index.html)

Emergency Number:
  In case of emergency within Korea, please call APCTP office at
  (054) 279-8661 through 8664 during the office hours. 
  After the office hours, please ring the mobile phones of the LOC members:
  M-G Park: 019-501-8430
  S-H Ahn: 016-312-8292
  D. Ryu: 019-420-5466

Conference Venue:
   The Conference will be held at the auditorium of the School of Environmental Engineering
   (building no. 16 in the map of http://www.postech.ac.kr/e/visitors/maps/map01.html). 

Abstract:
   We will be distributing the abstract booklet during the registration. Those who did not
   send the registration, please do so until June 19 to sha@kias.re.kr.
 
Travel tip:
  We recommend the following route to reach Pohang, the workshop city.
  Once you arrive at the Incheon Airport, which is the main gate for
  international flights, you may take a limousine shuttle bus to the
  Kimpo Airport, where most domestic flights are operated. The bus takes
  about 40 minutes and costs about  5,000 won. Then you may take a
  domestic flight from Kimpo to Pohang. There are six daily flights
  operated by Korean Airline from 7:30 am to 8:00 pm, and also six daily
  flights operated by Asiana Airline from 8:00 am to 8:50 pm. If you have
  a difficulty in reserving a flight, LOC can do it for you. The one-way
  ticket costs around 60,000 won, when purchased at the airport. The flight
  will take about 50 minutes. From the Pohang Airport to Yongildae (Hilton)
  Hotel, a taxi is recommended. It takea about 20 minutes and costs 5,000
  won. PLEASE TELL THE TAXI DRIVER TO GO TO YONGILDAE RATHER THAN
  HILTON BECAUSE THERE IS A BIG HILTON HOTEL IN GYEONGJU WHICH 
  IS MUCH FURTHER AWAY.

  There are other ways, which use either a train or bus or go through
  different international airports. But then, the trip will be somewhat
  complicated. In that case, please contact LOC, and LOC will help you
  with a detailed instruction.

Registration:
   The registration desk will be open from 8:30 am on June 24. The registration
   fee is 100,000 KRW that includes the conference dinner and the proceedings.
   The registration fee is reduced to 50,000 KRW for students. 
   For those whose registration fee is waived (mostly invited speakers, and non-supported
   students), the conference dinner ticket will be
   sold at 20,000 KRW (10,000 KRW for students).
