1.  PURCHASE ORDERS NO LONGER ACCEPTED FOR
     MEETING REGISTRATION

The AAS will no longer accept purchase orders for payment
of meeting registration fees, beginning with the June 2002
Meeting in Albuquerque, NM.  Additional details will be
announced with the meeting registration information in
mid-February. Members may wish to alert their institution
or agency to investigate alternative payment options.

_________________________________________________________
2.  MEMBERSHIP GRACE PERIOD

Due to the delay in mailing some of the AAS renewal
invoices and to postal processing difficulties experienced
this year, we will extend the grace period for AAS membership
and subscriptions through the month of January 2002.   No
reinstatement fee or back order charges will be required for
payments received by 31 January 2002.

6.  NASA EXPLORER PROGRAM COMMUNITY WORKSHOP
       Pre-registration deadline: 8 February 2002

The Explorer Program of the NASA Office of Space Science
will hold a one day, community workshop on 12 March 2002,
at the Washington Plaza Hotel in Washington, DC.  The
workshop will consist of a general session and a technology
exhibit/display session.  The general session will provide
an opportunity for discussion between NASA, the science
community, the industrial community, and other members of
the Explorer community on the current status of the
Explorer Program, Explorer Program policies and procedures,
and the future of the Explorer Program.  The agenda will
include discussions of Announcements of Opportunity, mission
cost caps and mission sizes, evaluation processes,
international and other agency partnering, launch vehicle
availability, missions of opportunity, and other topics as
they relate to the Explorer Program.  A technology exhibit/
display session will be held concurrent with the general
session to foster interactions between potential Explorer
partners.

The pre-registration deadline is 8 February 2002.
The deadline for group rate hotel reservations is 9 February.
Further information on the Explorer Workshop may be found at

     http://explorers.gsfc.nasa.gov/workshop/

7.  CALL FOR PROPOSALS AT THE KITT PEAK 12-METER TELESCOPE
       Proposal Deadline: 11 February 2002

Steward Observatory is currently operating the Kitt Peak
12-meter telescope, in cooperation with the NSF and the
Research Corporation. The telescope is expected to be
available for use by members of the astronomical community.

This call for proposals is for the period 1 March 2002
through 31 May 2002.  The proposal deadline for this period
is Monday, 11 February 2002.

Details about the telescope and its instrumentation can be
viewed at http://kp12m.as.arizona.edu.

Proposals should consist of the standard Kitt Peak 12-meter
cover sheet; a brief scientific justification (not to exceed
two pages + figures); and a source list with observing time
requirements and justification.  Kitt Peak 12-meter cover
sheets are available from the KP12M website

http://kp12m.as.arizona.edu/proposal_submission.html

in several computer formats.  The Kitt Peak 12-meter
Telescope TAC, appointed by the Steward Observatory Director,
will review all proposals.  The Director of the KP12M
will schedule successful proposals according to instrument
availability.

Please submit five paper copies of proposals for the 1 March
- 31 May period by 11 February 2002 to:

Dr. Aldo Apponi, Steward Observatory, The University of Arizona,
933 N. Cherry Avenue, Tucson, AZ 85721.

8.  NASA ANNOUNCEMENT OF OPPORTUNITY (AO-01-OSS-05):
       NGST FLIGHT INVESTIGATIONS
       Proposal Deadline: 5 March 2002

The NASA Announcement of Opportunity (AO) for Next Generation
Space Telescope (NGST) Flight Investigations is online at

http://research.hq.nasa.gov/code_s/nra/current/AO-01-OSS-05/index.html

This AO solicits science investigations that will use NGST.
Through this AO NASA will accept proposals for four different
types of scientific investigations that would:

* develop and use scientific instrumentation capable of
achieving the imaging goals of NGST in the near infrared
(NIR: defined as 0.6-5 microns) wavelength regime (hereafter
called NIRCam Principal Investigator [NIRCam PI] investigations);
or
* participate in the development, integration, and test of the
facility mid-infrared (MIR: defined as 5-28 microns) instrument
(MIRI) in addition to using data from the instrument
(MIRI Science Lead investigations and MIRI Science Team Member
investigations); or
* conduct interdisciplinary investigations using data taken
by the reference observatory and reference instrument set,
as well as actively participate in NGST facility and telescope
development (Facility Scientist investigations and Telescope
Scientist investigations); or
* conduct interdisciplinary investigations using data taken
by the reference observatory and reference instrument set and
participate in the science oversight of the NGST development
(Interdisciplinary Scientist [IDS] investigations).

The proposal deadline is 5 March 2002.  Please visit the above
URL to learn more about this opportunity.
