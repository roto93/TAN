             Title :   Tools for High Energy Astrophysics: 
                           X-ray/gamma-ray Telescopes

             
             Abstract:
             
             High energy astrophysics has developed at a tremendous rate
             in recent decades since the discovery of the first cosmic
             X-ray source, Sco X-1, in 1962.  Developments are mainly
             attributed to the improvements of X-ray/gamma-ray
             telescope/detector techniques.  

             I will briefly overview the instrumentation for high energy
             astrophysics, including observations, imaging methods,
             detectors and event processings.  Finally, I will introduce
             some of important X-ray/gamma-ray telescopes since early
             70's, and also some large projects in the beginning of 
             21st century.
