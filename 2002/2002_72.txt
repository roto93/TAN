                 Title:  AGN Jet Formation.

                 Abstract:

                 We carried out 2.5-dimensional resistive magneto-
                 hydrodynamical simulations to study the effects of 
                 magnetic diffusivity on magnetically driven mass 
                 accretion and jet formation. The initial state is a
                 constant angular-momentum torus threaded by large-scale 
                 vertical magnetic fields. Since the angular momentum of 
                 the torus is extracted due to magnetic braking, the torus 
                 medium falls toward the central region. The infalling matter 
                 twists the large-scale magnetic fields and drives bipolar
                 outflow. We found that: 
                 
                 (1) when the normalized magnetic diffusivity is small 
                     (<10^-3), mass accretion and jet formation take place 
                     intermittently; 
                 (2) when it is between 10^-3 and 10^-2, the system 
                     evolves toward a quasi-steady state; and 
                 (3) when it is > 10^-2 the accretion/mass outflow rate 
                     decreases with diffusivity and approaches 0.

                 The results of these simulations indicate that in the
                 center of a galaxy which has a super-massive black hole, 
                 a massive gas torus and magnetic braking provide a mass 
                 accretion rate which is sufficient to explain the activity 
                 of AGNs when the normalized magnetic diffusivity is smaller 
                 than 5x10^-2.
