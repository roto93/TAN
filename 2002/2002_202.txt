Subject: Call for Papers: Paris Interstellar Message Workshop

Encoding Altruism: The Art and Science of Interstellar Message
Composition

On March 23-24, 2003, the second in a series of international workshops
on interstellar message design will be held in Paris. The workshop will
focus on two broad themes: first, the interface of art, science, and
technology in interstellar message design; and second, how to
communicate sociobiological accounts of altruism in interstellar
messages. Papers addressing other topics related to message construction
will be considered on a space available basis. The workshop will focus
on messages that could be transmitted across interstellar space by radio
or laser signals.

Participation is by invitation only. Each potential participant should
send a 200-word abstract of his/her proposed paper and either a
c.v./resume or a URL describing professional background to
altruism@seti.org no later than December 1, 2002. Potential participants
may be contacted for additional information. Invitations will be issued
by January 24, 2003.

Subject: Re: [Colloquium] ASIAA Colloquium and Informal Talk

Dear colleagues,
Here is an introduction to tomorrow's colloquium.
Enjoy.
Minho

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joint Colloquium    11.5.2002

Dr. Venkataraman Radhakrishnan, director emeritus of the Raman 
Research Institute in Bangalore, India, will speak on the history
and physics of sailing crafts.   Professor Radhakrishnan has had
a wonderful career in radio astronomy, having discovered the radiation
belt around Jupiter, recognizing that pulsars are spinning neutron
stars and interpreting their observations, leading the Raman 
Institute, and training many students.  His talk today is about 
his passion for sailing.  This is a great opportunity for students
to see how a physicist applies his knowledge and interests to areas
outside of one's immediate discipline.  We can find exciting adventures
in many facets of life and we can also find many ways to contribute.
Come hear a talk out of the ordinary!

Dr. Paul T.P. Ho
Distinguished Research Fellow
Director, Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics
