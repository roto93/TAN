Abstract:
Understanding the organic chemistry of molecular clouds, particularly
the formation of biologically important molecules, is fundamental to
the study of the processes which lead to the origin, evolution and
distribution of life in the Galaxy.  Determining the level of molecular
complexity attainable in the clouds, and the nature of the complex
organic material available to protostellar disks and the planetary
systems that form from them, requires an understanding of the possible
chemical pathways and is therefore a central question in astrochemistry.
Although many organics can be produced in gas phase reactions, reactions
on the surfaces of cold interstellar dust grains are probably the major
source of complex organic material.  Gas phase observations of hot 
molecular cores, where icy grain mantles have recently been evaporated,
offer the prospect of studying the products of grain surface chemistry
directly.  We have thus searched for pre-biologically important molecules
in the hot molecular cloud cores: Sgr B2(N-LMH), W51 e1/e2 and Orion-KL.
Detections of these organic molecules in the interstellar space will have
important implications for Astrobiology.  Some of our results will be 
presented.
