Subject: Re: [Colloquium] ASIAA Colloquium and Informal Talk

Dear colleagues,
Here is an introduction to tomorrow's colloquium.
Enjoy.
Minho

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joint Colloquium    11.5.2002

Dr. Venkataraman Radhakrishnan, director emeritus of the Raman 
Research Institute in Bangalore, India, will speak on the history
and physics of sailing crafts.   Professor Radhakrishnan has had
a wonderful career in radio astronomy, having discovered the radiation
belt around Jupiter, recognizing that pulsars are spinning neutron
stars and interpreting their observations, leading the Raman 
Institute, and training many students.  His talk today is about 
his passion for sailing.  This is a great opportunity for students
to see how a physicist applies his knowledge and interests to areas
outside of one's immediate discipline.  We can find exciting adventures
in many facets of life and we can also find many ways to contribute.
Come hear a talk out of the ordinary!

Dr. Paul T.P. Ho
Distinguished Research Fellow
Director, Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics
