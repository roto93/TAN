Dear COSPAR Associate,

Last December, COSPAR held a very successful meeting at INPE in Brazil, =
which was the first in a planned series of Capacity-Building Workshops. =
The second is to be held in Udaipur, India, from 13-24 January, 2003, =
the topic being "Data Processing from the Chandra and XMM-Newton =
Missions".

The workshop is aimed at astronomers working at all wavelengths, not =
just X-rays, throughout the Asia-Pacific region. Financial support will =
be available for participants who require it. I am writing to ask for =
your help in publicising the opportunity to good candidates in this =
region, but especially in your country. I would be grateful if you would =
bring it to the attention of your whole astronomical community as widely =
as possible. To assist you, I enclose as an attachment a copy of the =
poster advertising the meeting. Further details can be obtained from =
www.cosparhq.org or www.prl.ernet.in.

Many thanks for any help you are able to give.

Yours sincerely,=20

Peter Willmore
Chair, COSPAR Panel on Capacity Building
