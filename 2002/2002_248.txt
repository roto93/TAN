1) GENERALITIES
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Center for Academic Excellence on "Cosmology and Particle Astro-
physics" of the National Taiwan University (Taida CosPA Center) will 
organize a symposium, the 2003 International Symposium on Cosmology 
and Particle Astrophysics (CosPA2003), from May 8 to May 10, 2003 
in Taipei, Taiwan. The first Symposium (CosPA 2002) was held from 
May 30 to June 2, 2002 in Taipei, Taiwan. 
        
The goal of the CosPA2003 Symposium is intended to bring together 
scientists to engage serious discussions on the following topics, 
among others: 
 
   (1) CMB Physics 
 
   (2) Dark Matter and Dark Energy 
 
   (3) Cosmology of Neutrinos and Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays 
 
   (4) Inflation and New Physics
 
It is hoped that the symposium will serve as the forum for relevant
researchers to exchange ideas or thoughts on the forefronts of the 
observational and theoretical cosmology and particle astrophysics. 
There will be invited review lectures, invited talks, and contributed 
talks. 
 
This symposium is co-sponsored by the Ministry of Education, the 
National Science Council, and the National Taiwan University.
