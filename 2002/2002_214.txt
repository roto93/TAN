Dear Hsien Shang,
 
>From Henrik Beuther I learned, that you have contact to young students,
that might be interested in studying in Germany. May I ask you to
forward the following letter to these young scientists. We would be glad
to receive some interesting applications for our IMPRS in
Radioastronomy.
Thank you very much.
With best regards
Elisabeth Lahr-Nilles

Dear students,
A new training program for doctoral students is offered by the Max
Planck Institute for Radioastronomy and the University of Bonn, Germany.
Funded by the Max Planck Society, the International Max Planck Research
School (IMPRS) for Radio and Infrared Astronomy is open to all qualified
students. The school offers research opportunities and the possibility
to pursue a doctoral degree at the University of Bonn. A limited number
of scholarships are available. Working language of the school is
English. 
Research topics include a wide range of themes:
*	black holes and active galactic nuclei 
*	cosmology 
*	astro-particle physics 
*	the early universe 
*	star formation 
*	pulsars 
*	technical topics such as instrumental development in the areas
of state-of-the-art detectors for astronomy.
The school offers several elements of student training in addition to
regular graduate courses at the University of Bonn: special lectures and
seminars relating directly to current research, technology, and methods
relevant to the ongoing thesis research in the IMPRS class. Students
progress will be monitored by individual thesis committees. 
 
Applications are accepted continuously. Students are selected based on
academic merit. The participating students are expected to enrol in a
doctoral program either at the University of Bonn or at another German
or international university. 
If you are interested in the program, please contact us at 
imprs@mpifr-bonn.mpg.de
 
For more information about the school and application forms refer to our
web pages:

Elisabeth Lahr-Nilles
IMPRS Co-ordinator
