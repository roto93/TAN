Title:    The Galilean Satellites: Four Worlds with Subsurface Oceans

Speaker:  Prof. Wing-Huen Ip  
          (National Central University)

Date:    20 December 2002 (Friday)

Time:    12:10
Place:   Room 620,  Physics Building, NTHU

Abstract:
The discovery of the four Galilean moons of Jupiter by Galileo almost
four hundred years had changed completely the view of the Solar System
and the cosmo. Measurements by the Galileo spacecraft in its Oribter
mission have also changed completely our view of the Solar System and
the possible origin of life itself. In this presentation, we will review
the fundamental knowledge and the new findings from the Galileo mission
including the possible existence of life-supporting subsurface oceans in
these icy satellites and their intriguing interactions with the Jovian
magnetosphere.
