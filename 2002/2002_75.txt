                     ASIAA Summer Student Program 2002

  Are you interested in astronomy, and would like to experience frontier
  research in astronomy and astrophysics or astronomical instrumentation ?
  If so, join the ASIAA Summer Student program, where you can gain this
  experience under the supervision of professional astronomers or
  physicists.

         Opportunity is open for up to about 10 students, normally at the
         junior level or higher (especially outstanding freshman and
         high-school students also will be considered), and who are
         majoring in physics, astronomy, or related subjects. All
         successful candidates are expected to spend 2 months at the
         ASIAA, working on a research program under the guidance of their
         individual supervisors. We especially encourage students from
         outside Taipei to apply, and will provide local accomodations for
         these students. Students based in Taipei requiring local
         accomodations are asked to explain why they need such
         accomodations. (More details is available on-line.)

         To apply, please send your curriculum vitae, university academic
         record, and statement of research preference to:

         Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics Academia Sinica
         P.O. Box 23-141 Taipei 106, Taiwan, R.O.C.
