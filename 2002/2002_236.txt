Subject: Small Asteroid found at Lulin 


Two NCU graduate students found an uncharted asteroid on November 25,
2002, with the Lulin One-meter Telescope (LOT).  Chiu-Wen Chen and Zhi-Wei
Zhang spot this moving object during their photometric monitoring project
of Jovian Trojans.

The Minor Planet Center confirmed the discovery, and designated it 2002
WT18, also named as Lulin 1 by the discoverers.  It measures 1-2 km
across, and at discovery had R~20.6 mag.  An animation of the discovery
images can be seen in

The discovery signifies the very first scientific result since the LOT saw
its first light, and demonstrates the advantage of a telescope
conveniently accessible to students.
