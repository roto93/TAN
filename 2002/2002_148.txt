It is my pleasure to let you know that the German 1 meter telescope was
smoothly installed last week at Lulin.  It is housed in the new building,
which would also accommodate additional living and lab space than
currently available.  Shakedown immediately followed.  Optical and polar
alignment has been done.  Further sky test was hampered by the typhoon
last week and the clouds it brought in.  First viewing, by eyes and by a
CCD camera, indicated a satisfactory optical/mechanical system
performance.  We will continue to perfect the system and expect to start 
routine observations in a month.
