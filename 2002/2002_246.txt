Title :   On the Cause of Solar Differential Rotation 

Speaker:  Prof. Ling-Hsiao Lyu 
          (National Central University)

Date:    27 December 2002 (Friday)

Time:    12:10
Place:   Room 620,  Physics Building, NTHU

Absrtact:
Based on a simple force balance analysis, we propose that the cause of
large-scale solar differential rotation in the solar convection zone is due to
presence of polarward temperature gradient at the bottom of solar convection
zone, which is also the upper half  of soalr tachocline.  The polarward
temperature gradient is due to presence of inward magnetic force in the middle
and lower latitude region, but not in the high latitude region.  The polarward
temperature gradient in a rotational star can trigger (1) easterly wind to cause
latitudinal differential rotation and (2) Rossby waves as well as horizontal
circulations on two sides of the Rossby wave.  Observations of possible Rossby
wave associated phenomena on the solar disk and in the solar wind will be
discussed.  Our model also concludes that there should also be an equatorward
temperature gradient in the lower-half solar tachocline, which can lead to
westerly wind in this region.  These results are consistent with MDI
observations, in which opposite differential rotation patterns can be found in
upper-half and lower-half tachocline regions.
