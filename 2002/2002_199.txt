Encoding Altruism: The Art and Science of Interstellar Message
Composition

On March 23-24, 2003, the second in a series of international workshops
on interstellar message design will be held in Paris. The workshop will
focus on two broad themes: first, the interface of art, science, and
technology in interstellar message design; and second, how to
communicate sociobiological accounts of altruism in interstellar
messages. Papers addressing other topics related to message construction
will be considered on a space available basis. The workshop will focus
on messages that could be transmitted across interstellar space by radio
or laser signals.

Participation is by invitation only. Each potential participant should
send a 200-word abstract of his/her proposed paper and either a
c.v./resume or a URL describing professional background to
altruism@seti.org no later than December 1, 2002. Potential participants
may be contacted for additional information. Invitations will be issued
by January 24, 2003.
