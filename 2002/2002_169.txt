Abstract:

Abstract
Secondary atmospheric antiprotons are studied. A parametrisation of the
inclusive cross section for the \pbar production in $p+p$ and $p+A$ collisions
is developed, based on the Quark Counting Rule, the Regge Phenomenology and data
fitting. This parametrisation is shown to have a good agreement with
experimental data for incident nucleon energy at least up to 24 GeV/n in the
laboratory frame. By the analysis of the \pbar mean multiplicity distribution,
this parametrisation can extend at least up to the centre of mass energy
$\sqrt{s} \simeq 25$ GeV. Based on this well developed parametrisation, the
Wounded Nucleon Model is applied to obtained the \pbar production cross section
in $A+A$ collisions. By including cosmic protons and heliums, the atmospheric
\pbar flux at high balloon and satellite altitudes are calculated. The
$He$-induced collisions are shown to contribute about 30\% in the total
secondary atmospheric \pbar flux. It is observed that, for the interest of the
\pbar exotic origins such as the annihilation of supersymmetric dark matter
(neutralino) and the evaporation of primordial black holes, the energy range up
to $E=200$ GeV/n for cosmic particles generating the secondary atmospheric \pbar
production is the most important. It is shown that the secondary atmospheric
\pbar flux used to correct the \pbar flux at TOA was underestimated in the
previous works. In this work, the \pbar flux at TOA is then modified 10-15\%
lower than the originally deduced, for the energy range $E_k>1$ GeV. A \pbar
measurement experiment at the ground level is used to test the accuracy of
secondary atmospheric \pbar production calculated by different works. The
results of the BESS 1999 experiment at 2.77 km have confirmed the correctness of
the present approach. At the AMS altitude, it is shown that the \pbar flux
measured by AMS is almost the exact \pbar flux at TOA, with only 2-3\% of the
atmospheric \pbar component. It is found that, even at very high altitudes,
thousands of kilometres above the Earth, there are still some residual
atmospheric antiprotons and their trajectories are very complex and cannot be
well explained by the usual variables. Finally, the secondary atmospheric $p$
flux at low altitudes are calculated. The deviation between the calculation and
the measurements and the possible origins of this deviation are discussed.
Comments, remarks and conclusions are given.\\ \vspace*{1cm}\\ {\bf Keywords:}
