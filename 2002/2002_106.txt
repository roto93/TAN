1.  HOW TO AVOID INTERNET INTERRUPTION AT THE AAS MEETING

If you plan on attending the AAS Meeting in Albuquerque,
NM, 2-6 June 2002, you will most likely want to use
the Meeting's Cyber Cafe for Email and Web Browsing.
In order to ensure continuous access to your home site,
please notify your local system and security administrators
of the following:

The Internet traffic flowing from the meeting attendees,
will be coming from the IP addresses ranging from

198.59.158.0/24
204.134.105.0/24
204.134.106.0/24
204.134.107.0/24

In the past government sites have become aware of heavy
traffic from our meetings and without notice shut off ALL 
access to attendees.  This was done as a security measure, 
unaware that the traffic was originating at an AAS Annual 
Meeting.  It caused several days of service interruption for 
meeting registrants.  Informing your system administrators 
of the IP addresses could save you a lot of distress later!

Any further questions can be directed to Debbie Kovalsky,
AAS Manager Information Systems - mailto:kovalsky@aas.org.

2.  NSF FINALIZES NOAO AND NSO MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT WITH AURA

The competition for the management of National Optical Astronomy 
Observatory (NOAO) and National Solar Observatory (NSO) has been 
completed.  The National Science Foundation (NSF) received three 
highly competitive proposals, each putting forward a very 
different approach to the stewardship of our national 
observatories.  After careful evaluation of the proposals by 
a review panel and exhaustive discussion within NSF, the 
National Science Board (NSB) approved our negotiating a new 
Cooperative Agreement with Associated Universities for Research 
in Astronomy, Inc. (AURA), to manage NOAO and NSO for the next 
five years.  In keeping with AURA's proposal, we do not expect 
business as usual.  In proposing this award to the NSB, we also 
stipulated that the NSF Division of Astronomical Sciences (AST) 
would form a high-level advisory committee to assist us in setting 
the mission and roles of NOAO and in evaluating AURA's implementation 
of these roles.  By doing this we will assure that the priorities 
and progress of NOAO are overseen by the entire community and not 
only by AURA.

3.  NSF MPS ASSISTANT DIRECTOR STEPS DOWN
    
The NSF Astronomy Division regrets to inform the AAS membership 
that Dr. Robert Eisenstein, Assistant Director of NSF's 
Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate, will be stepping 
aside as of 31 May 2002.  Astronomy has been fortunate to have 
had Bob serve as MPS Assistant Director during his five year 
tenure; his support of  the Gemini Observatory and his 
championship of ALMA have been essential to their realization.  
His concern for the health of the grants program, its PI's and 
students, has enabled the Astronomy Division to make significant 
progress in the past few years in increasing funding rates among 
research grants.  He will be missed.

Bob will be spending the next year at CERN, in Geneva, on 
professional development leave.  Dr. John Hunt becomes acting 
Assistant Director effective 1 June while a nationwide search 
is conducted for the next MPS Assistant Director.

4.  GOLDSTONE RADAR OBSERVING OPPORTUNITY

The Task Manager for the Goldstone Solar System Radar would 
like to remind the community that the deadline for observing 
proposals for the period 01 January 2003 through 01 June 2003 
are due no later than 15 June 2002. The procedure and on-line 
observing cover sheet application form is available at:

http://www331.jpl.nasa.gov/radar/gssrpropform1.html

The forms are also available in Word 6 and ASCII text formats at

http://www331.jpl.nasa.gov/radar/

The scientific justification to be sent separately should 
ideally be in PDF format (no more than two pages or 500 words) 
for the convenience of reviewers.
