Molecular Synthesis in the Circumstellar Environment 

Sun Kwok (³¢·s) 

Recent observations by the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) have found evidence of rapid synthesis of complex organic molecules in the late stages of stellar evolution.  The chemical synthesis begins with the formation of acetylene, the first building block of benzene, in carbon stars.  In a following proto-planetary nebulae stage, emission features corresponding to stretching and bending modes of aliphatic compounds are detected.  When these objects evolve to become planetary nebulae, aromatic C-H and C-C stretching and bending modes become strong.  These results show that complex carbonaceous compounds can be produced in a circumstellar environment over a period of only a few thousand years. 

In this talk, we will summarize the history of astronomical infrared spectroscopy in the last 30 years, discuss the formation of solid-state inorganic and organic compounds in stars, and outline a possible scenario of chemical evolution of organic material in the circumstellar environment. 

Dr. Sun Kwok is a professor of astronomy at the University of Calgary and Killam Fellow of the Canada Council for the Arts.  He served as chairman of the Planetary Nebulae Working Group of the International Astronomical Union between 1994 and 2001 and as co-chair of the 2001 IAU symposium on planetary nebulae in Canberra, Australia.  He is the author of two recent books published by the Cambridge University Press: "The Origin and Evolution of Planetary Nebulae" in 2000 and "Cosmic Butterflies" in 2001.
