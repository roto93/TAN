Dear Colleagues,

*** Workshop on Gravitation, Relativity and Cosmology 2002 ***

A one day workshop on Gravitation, Relativity and Cosmology (GRC2002) will
be held at National Central University, Chung-Li, Taiwan on Saturday
December 28, 2002.

Researchers and students interested in all areas of Gravitation, Relativity
and Cosmology -- classical and quantum, theory and experiment -- are welcome
to attend. At the end of the workshop, we will have a birthday party to
celebrate Professor James M. Nester's 60th Birthday.

A website for the meeting has been set up at:
http://www.phy.ncu.edu.tw/gravity/workshop/2002
If you are planning to come, please register for the workshop using the
registration form provided there.


Best wishes,
Chiang-Mei Chen
Roh-Suan Tung

 ***********  Second NCTS Workshop on Astroparticle Physics  ************

               國家理論科學研究中心第二屆粒子天文物理研討會

  Date: 2003/01/16~2003/01/18
  
  Place: 龍潭渴望學習中心

        Astroparticle physics is a new frontier between conventional
  astrophysics and particle physics, and is a rapidly developing field of
  research. Gamma rays, neutrinos and cosmic rays are presently the main
  source of information about the highest energy phenomenon occurring in
  the cosmos. The particle physics gives a microscopic theory for the
  interpretation of this information. New observations in particle physics
  such as neutrino oscillations suggest a re-examination of these
  interpretations. In this "Second NCTS Workshop on Astroparticle
  Physics", the review lectures will cover the above-mentioned topics,
  whereas the shorter talks, currently arranged by invitations, will focus
  on the more recent progress in the same area.

Title:   Protoplanetary disks

SPEAKER: Prof. Paul Ho (ASIAA/Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory)

ABSTRACT

Recent progress has allowed the imaging of the structures of disks
around young stars.  Some of these systems may already begin the
formation of planets.  We will discuss what kinds of studies are 
now possible.
