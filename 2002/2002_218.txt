Dear Colleagues:

     We will have an exciting winter school coming up for all the
biophysics or bionano go-ers. We have invited Paul Higgs, Henri Orland,
Paul Hansma, Tony Zee, all famous bio guys, as our foreign lectuers.

     The session will start on 2 p.m. at our auditorium (204) and late
registration will be handled during 1:00-2:00 p.m. We encourage you to
register early especially if you need hotel accommodations or wish to join
us for the reception party (Monday) or the banquet (Wednesday). 

     Other sessions: Full day on 12/17 & 12/18 but with a long lunch
                     break. Half day, 12/19 p.m. & 12/20 a.m.

                         Best wishes to you all, W-Y. Pauchy Hwang
