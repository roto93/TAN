* IMPORTANT DATES:

February 28, 2002    -->  Pre-registration including abstract submission
April 2, 2002        -->  Final list of participants and second =
announcement
July 16-20, 2002     -->  Conference



* SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE:

The evolution of galaxies has become an observational fact mainly after
recent sky surveys (e.g. the HST deep field survey, the Canada-France
redshift survey, or ISO deep surveys) have shown that the properties
of distant galaxies, which formed early in the life of the Universe,=20
differ from those of nearby ones. New observational windows at X-ray, =
UV,
infrared and millimetric wavelengths (ROSAT, IUE, IRAS, ISO, IRAM) have
revealed that galaxies contain a wealth of components (very hot gas, =
atomic
hydrogen, molecules, dust, dark matter).  However, theoretical modelling =
has
not progressed as fast as the census of the content of galaxies.  So =
far,
most models are very empirical or semi-empirical.  A real understanding =
of
galaxy evolution requires a proper physical description of the galaxy
components as well as of the coupling and feedback between them: stars =
and
gas, cold and hot phases of the interstellar medium, large scale and =
small
scale phenomena.

A significant advance is expected in the near future mostly due to the
combination of two circumstances.  On the one hand, the exploration of =
the
most distant Universe will be possible with new facilities on the ground
and in space (e.g. VLT, FIRST, XMM, etc.).  On the other hand, the =
rapidly
developing computing facilities will permit, for the first time, the
calculations of self-consistent models of galaxy evolution. =20
During the next decade we can expect a breakthrough in galaxy modelling, =

in which all the relevant large and small scale processes will be taken=20
into account in a consistent way. It will be possible to test this new=20
generation of models against improved observational constraints.

We have started a cycle of three Euroconferences on the evolution of
galaxies.  The first conference, devoted to the observational clues,
took place in May 2000 in Granada (Spain). The second conference,=20
held in October 2001 on the Island of La Reunion (France),=20
addressed the interplay between the different components of a galaxy:=20
interstellar matter, star formation, stellar evolution and death,=20
role of dynamics and environment. The third and last one will take
place in July 2002 in Kiel (Germany) and will address the detailed
modelling of galaxy formation and evolution.

The third conference will bring together specialists from the field of=20
galaxy evolution, theoreticians and observers, that are essential=20
for a substantial discussion and validation the models.

* SCIENTIFIC ORGANIZATION:

The general idea of the conference is to exchange views on the=20
techniques which allow a better understanding of the global evolution=20
of galaxies. To achieve this goal, speakers will be required to put=20
their presentation into a context and clearly mention their starting=20
points, assumptions and methods, in particular how they differ from=20
those of other people. Presentations dealing with similar topics will=20
be followed by a joint discussion, which should help their=20
confrontation.

Each of the sessions will be composed of invited review talks,=20
contributed oral presentations (which may include progress reports as=20
well as critical reviews) and posters. Authors of posters will be=20
given the opportunity to advertise their work by one transparency.=20
Posters will be at display during the entire conference and there=20
will be ample time for poster viewing during breaks.
Each day will end with a general discussion introduced by a=20
specialist on a key issue for galaxy evolution.


Oral presentations will be selected by the SOC among contributions =
dealing
explicitly with the topic of this third conference. Posters on topics =
related
to the themes of the other conferences of the series are welcome.

Proceedings of the conference will be published, including reports of
the discussions.

The conference will start with three introductory talks:=20
a survey of the most recent key observational data,=20
an introduction to the early formation and evolution of galaxy =
morphologies=20
and then a reflection about the influence of large-scale effects on =
galactic
evolution.

It will proceed with presentations of particular galaxy components,
disks and dwarf galaxies and galactic centers, in order to gain insights =

into different influencial processes during galaxy evolution.=20

For a detailed comparison of results from state-of-the-art modelling,=20
analytical approaches and the complex chemo-dynamical description will =
be=20
discussed in the context of gas processes that affect galactic =
evolution.
The role of future observations to probe the newly proposed models will =
be=20
addressed, and especially the use of the next generations of instruments =

and telescopes will be highlighted.=20

Two final reviews will be devoted to the modelling of galaxies as =
complex=20
systems and the modelling of complex systems in general, permitting an
exchange of views about the philosophy underlying the modelling =
procedure=20
and the techniques used in various areas of science that should benefit=20
to all the participants.

In summary, some of the main topics to be addressed are:=20
the early evolution of galaxies and the metal enrichment of the =
intergalactic=20
medium,=20
the formation and evolution of the different morphological types of =
galaxies,=20
in particular, the evolution of disk galaxies, of dwarf galaxies and=20
low surface brightness galaxies,=20
the formation of starbursts,=20
the modelling of the large scale effects on galaxy evolution,=20
the effect of galaxy merging and of gas infall,=20
the influence of satellite galaxies, the formation of galactic centers,=20
the relation between starbursts and active galactic nuclei,=20
the role of massive black holes.=20



* PARTICIPATION:

Participation of young researchers from European countries is especially =

encouraged.

According to the rules on Euroconferences, attendance is limited to
100 persons. The SOC will select the participants on the basis of
their proposed contribution (or motivation for young researchers).
Preference will be given to young researchers participating in all
the three conferences of the series.

The SOC will select for oral presentations the contributions dealing
explicitly with the topic of this third conference. Plenty of time and
sufficient weight will be given to posters. Posters on topics related=20
to the themes of the other conferences of the series are also welcome.



* FEES:

The conference fee will be 200 Euros.



* CONFERENCE LOCATION:

The conference will take place at the University of Kiel. Kiel is
the capital of Schleswig-Holstein which is the most northern federal=20
state of Germany, located between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea.
Kiel itself is directly located at the Baltic Sea which makes it
very well suited for maritime events like the "Kieler Woche", the=20
world's most famous sailing festival. The surroundings are characterized =

by a large variety of small lakes south of Kiel, extended sandy beaches=20
at the Baltic Sea and some Fjord-like structures north of Kiel.=20

The conference itself will be housed in the Physics center of the=20
Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel which was founded in 1665.=20
Astronomy in Kiel has a long tradition starting already after the
foundation of the university with Astronomy lectures by Samuel Reyer.
The astrophysics of Kiel is traditionally known for stellar atmospheres =
and=20
radiative transfer, the so-called Unsoeld school. In the line of this =
field,=20
however, the determination of stellar abundances is connected with the =
study =20
of stellar populations for understanding the evolution of the Milky Way. =

More unknown is that the extragalactic tradition in Kiel reaches back to =
1918=20
when the Observator of the Kiel observatory, Carl Wilhelm Wirtz, =
concluded=20
from his studies of spiral nebulae that they are located outside the =
Milky Way=20
and, furthermore, that the system of spiral nebulae is expanding.
In this tradition also the first modern extragalactic conference in 1983 =

connected "Stellar Winds and Coronae" with "Dynamics of Galaxies". Ten =
years=20
later the rapidly developing field of extragalactic research in German=20
astrophysics was pushed towards modern observational facilities and =
their=20
results gathering more than 150 astronomers at the international meeting =
on=20
"Panchromatic View of Galaxies - their evolutionary puzzle". In =
addition, it
should be mentioned that the mirror system of modern X-ray telecopes was =

invented by Wolter 1951 in Kiel.=20

The lecture room and the hall for poster presentations are closely =
connected=20
in the Physics center. Coffee and drinks will be served in this hall
during the breaks to create an atmosphere for lively discussions and =
help=20
initiate new collaborations.

Lunch can be taken in the canteen of the university vis-a-vis of
the Physics center or in some nearby restaurants. The canteen offers =
different
dishes from a snack style to a salad bar and normally also vegetarian =
ones.

In July the weather is expected to be warm and mild, with average =
temperature=20
of 22-27 C at daytime but also warm at night. However, due to the =
proximity=20
of the North and Baltic Sea one should be prepared for colder (>15 C) =
and=20
rainy days. One of the charms of Kiel in July is the length of the days=20
in summer, with late sunset and a bright northern sky.=20
This allows long walks in the picturesque port at sunset or beer-tasting =

evening with friends in local beer gardens.

Kiel is very safe, with no endemic diseases so that no special
vaccination is required. However, you should make sure that you have a
valid health insurance for Germany.

An overview of Kiel can be found on the WEB site =
http://www.kiel-tourist.de/
(english and german versions of the site are available)



* TRANSPORTATION AND LODGING

Kiel can be easily reached by plane via Hamburg airport. From Hamburg
airport a direct public bus transport to Kiel is available=20
(schedule will be given later on our web-page).=20
Alternatively, you can fly directly to the small airport of =
Kiel-Holtenau.=20
However, there are only a few connections per day from Berlin, Cologne,=20
Frankfurt and Munich.

It is expected that participants will make their own lodging=20
reservations.  A list of convenient hotels will be provided in the=20
second announcement, for which the tourist office will arrange=20
special offers for our conference. A form sheet will be made=20
available on our web page to be directly faxed by the participants to=20
any of the recommended hotels.

>From all the recommended hotels the Physics center and the University=20
can be reached conveniently by public buses.



* SUPPORT

Funds from the European Community are available to provide some=20
support to a number of participants for attending the conference,
mainly young researchers from the European Community and invited
speakers. A limited amount of extra funds should also be available
from other sources. In any case, support will be distributed on a
case by case basis, upon request. If needed, please fill in the
pre-registration form appropriately.



* SOCIAL EVENTS:

- A reception party with a welcome drink on Monday evening in a =
restaurant;=20
- A reception by the town of Kiel is planned;
- A half-day excursion to the vicinity of Kiel combined with the=20
conference dinner;
- Because the annual Schleswig-Holstein Music Festival starts at the=20
beginning of July a special concert for the conference participants is
planned to be arranged;=20
- For those who are not tired by the conference or who need some=20
compensation to a week of conference immobility a soccer competition
on the last evening of the conference will be arranged.



* PUBLIC OUTREACH PROGRAMME

A public talk on formation and evolution of galaxies will be held by =
Gerhard
Hensler in the Auditorium Maximum of the University on one of the first=20
evenings.=20
The session on complex systems will be the subject of special=20
advertisement at the Kiel University, as it is expected to provide an=20
opportunity for interaction with local students and professors.
