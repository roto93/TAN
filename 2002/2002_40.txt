34th CONFERENCE of EUROPEAN GROUP for ATOMIC SPECTROSCOPY
                        EGAS 34
                    Sofia, 9-12 July 2002

SECOND ANNOUNCEMENT

GENERAL REMARKS
The 34th EGAS conference is an Europhysics Conference of the European 
Physical Society (EPS) organized by the local Bulgarian committee as an 
annual meeting of European Group of Atomic Spectroscopy of the EPS. 
The conference is sponsored by EC in the framework of the EC Program 
Human Research Potential - "High Level Scientific Conferences" (contract 
No: HPCFCT-2001-00338)
The scientific program of EGAS 34 will cover all aspects of spectra of simple 
and complicate atoms, ions (including highly charged) and small molecules; 
atomic constants and application in astrophysics.
The Conference will be focused to the rapid progress of quantum optics, laser 
manipulation of atoms, cooling and trapping of atoms and molecules, Bose-
Einstein condensate, atomic lasers, laser spectroscopy, generation of 
ultrashort EM pulses, and application of quantum optics in metrology. 
Special attention will be paid to the atomic spectroscopy aspects of low and 
high temperature plasma and application to light sources. 
The experimental methods and instrumentation will be discussed.

Friday				(July 12) 	National Historical Museum

GENERAL ASSEMBLY AND ELECTIONS
The General Assembly will be held during the EGAS Conference in Sofia on 
Thursday, 12 July - 12h. All participants are kindly invited. Any delegate 
attending the conference is entitled to participate in the General Assembly.
The affairs of EGAS are managed by a Board of fifteen members, who are 
elected by the General Assembly at the annual conference. Each Board 
member is elected for a term of three years and is then eligible for re-election 
for a second term. Usually, Board members do not serve beyond six years. 
An attempt is made to achieve a reasonable regional balance in the Board 
membership, but it is important to realize that the Board members are not 
elected simply to represent their own nations.
Three of the EGAS Board members (M. Allegrini, F. Bylicki, G. Guthöhrlein) 
have to be replaced. 
Board members should be closely associated with one of the fields of work 
covered by EGAS. They should expect to attend the annual conferences and 
a Board meeting in November each year. They should also note that EGAS 
couldn't normally cover the costs of travel.
Please, ensure that any candidate that you nominate is willing to serve, if 
elected. Election will be organized at the conference.
