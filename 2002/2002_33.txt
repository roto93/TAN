                 Title:  CMB Constraints on Cosmic Quintessence

                 Abstract:

                 The equation of state of the hypothetical dark energy 
                 component, which constitutes about two thirds of the
                 critical density of the universe, may be very different
                 from that of a cosmological constant. Employing a
                 phenomenological model, we investigate the constraints
                 imposed on the scalar quintessence by supernovae
                 observations, and by the acoustic scale extracted from
                 recent CMB data. We show that a universe with dark energy
                 dominating over matter components in the dark age is
                 consistent to the current observational constraints. This
                 may have effects on the subsequent formation of large
                 scale structures.
