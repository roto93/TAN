Astronomy educators take note.  This is worth checking out.  I saw
the demonstration in the last AAS meeting in Washington DC, 
and it was quite impressive.  

Cheer,

Hello future Partiview users:

You were one of the many who signed up on our email list at the AAS meeting in
January 2002. At the time, I was saying to people that it would be about 6
months before Partiview would be up on our web site. Well, we came in a bit
under schedule. 

This letter is to announce the arrival of the 3-D visualization software
Partiview. Developed at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications
(NCSA), the American Museum of Natural History/Hayden Planetarium has been
awarded a grant by NCSA to develop Partiview into a more powerful, user-friendly
tool for the advancement of science. We have posted the Partiview software at
our web site: http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/. 

What we have posted as of 1 April 2002 is Partiview Version 0.5, the foundation
upon which we will build. Because this is the initial release, the program may
be a bit rough around the edges, and bugs may appear from time to time. However,
the program has been used extensively here for about a year and is generally
very robust. 
 
We intend to build a community of users for Partiview who can discuss the
software as well as share data with one another. In the future, our web site
will serve this community by answering FAQs, posting your data, as well as
addressing troubleshooting issues. 

Please feel free to contact us at this address if you have any comments and/or
questions. While we have no formal support team in place, we will try to answer
your questions in as timely a manner as possible. 

Thank you for your interest in Partiview!
