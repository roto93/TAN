Owing to the consideration that most of the Amiba
people might not be able to join the Journal Metting
today, the paper review "On the Mass-Period Correlation
of the Extrasolar Planets" is POSTPONED. The date of the
review will be announced later.

Next Monday (March 11) we will have Dr. King, Sun-Kun to
speak to us about the TAOS project.

Best regards,
Pin-Gao
