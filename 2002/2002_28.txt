       TITLE:    Long-Term Variation of the Solar Activity  by a Dynamo 
                 Effect Based on Magnetic Flux Tubes

       SPEAKER:  Prof. Antonio Ferriz Mas (Universidad de Vigo, Spain)

       DATE & TIME:  3:30 PM, February 21, 2002 (Thursday)

       PLACE:  Room 620, Physics Building


                         ABSTRACT 

The mean solar magnetic field behaves irregularly in time.
Grand minima are the most prominent manifestation of this
irregularity, albeit not the only one: it is also apparent in
the length and amplitude variations of the 11-year sunspot
cycle. Although the statistical and spectral properties of
solar activity --as measured by the sunspot number-- are
still not well known, there is evidence for various
modulations of the solar cycle.  The records of historical
sunspot observations and proxies of solar variability are
still too short to decide unambiguously if they are of
deterministic or of stochastic origin.

Many of the computations aiming at describing intermittent
activity are based on low-order systems of ordinary
differential equations (ODE) which can be considered as
truncated expansions of the partial differential dynamo
equations (PDE), but also models based on full PDE may lead
to intermittent behavior.

I will show that cyclic activity and Maunder-type grand
minima can be explained by a dynamo driven by the instability
of magnetic flux tubes in the overshoot layer at the bottom
of the solar convection zone.  The combination of a threshold
in field strength for dynamo action and random fluctuations
due to magnetic fields from the turbulent convection zone
leads to activity cycles with strong amplitude variations and
the occasional appearance of grand minima.
