University of Hawai'i, Department of Chemistry
Reaction Dynamics, Planetary Chemistry, Astrochemistry
The Department of Chemistry at the University of Hawai'i at Manoa 
invites applications for Ph.D. studentships in the fields of reaction 
dynamics, astrochemistry, planetary chemistry, astrobiology, and 
atmospheric chemistry beginning January 1, 2003. Exceptionally 
well-qualified candidates are offered teaching assistantships and full 
tuition fee waivers. The prime directive of our lab is to unravel the 
underlying reaction dynamics and elementary mechanisms on how complex 
(astrobiologically relevant) molecules are synthesized from the bottom 
up via single atoms, radicals, and small molecules in extraterrestrial 
ices and in atmospheres of planets and their satellites. Solid-state 
experiments employ two surface scattering machines and are conducted in 
collaboration with the Centre for Astrobiology, The Open University, 
Milton Keynes, UK. Elementary gas-phase reactions are carried out under 
single collision conditions utilizing a novel crossed molecular beams 
machine. Extensive collaborations exist with the Hawai'ian Institute of 
Geophysics and Planetology (HIGP), the Institute for Astronomy (IfA), 
and the International Astrophysics Network (IAN). Recent examples of our 
work can be found in Acc. Chem. Res. (34, 699-706, 2001), Int. J. 
Astrobiology (1, 15-23, 2002), Chemical Reviews (102, 1309-1358, 2002), 
Angew. Chemie Int. Ed. (41, 2350-2352, 2002), and Int. Rev. Physical 
Chemistry (21, 307-356, 2002). To apply, please send letter of interest, 
three letters of recommendation, transcripts or equivalent, and 
curriculum vitae to Prof. Ralf I. Kaiser, Department of Chemistry, 
University of Hawai'i at Manoa, Honolulu, HI 96822-2275, USA, or via 
email to kaiser@gold.chem.hawaii.edu. Applications will be reviewed 
beginning October 1, 2002 on a continuous basis.
