LO APPOINTED DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL RADIO ASTRONOMY OBSERVATORY

Washington, DC - Riccardo Giacconi, president of Associated Universities,
Inc. (AUI), the not-for-profit corporation that operates the National Radio
Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) under a cooperative agreement with the National
Science Foundation, is pleased to announce the appointment of Fred K.Y. Lo
as the director of the NRAO, effective September 1, 2002. Lo currently is a
Distinguished Research Fellow, and the Director of the Institute of
Astronomy and Astrophysics of the Academia Sinica, located in Taipei,
Taiwan.

Lo succeeds Paul A. Vanden Bout, who served as NRAO director
from January 1, 1985, to June 1, 2002. Vanden Bout stepped
down to become the interim director of the Joint ALMA (Atacama Large
Millimeter Array) Office. W. Miller Goss, former assistant director of New
Mexico Operations for NRAO, has been appointed as acting director in the
interim.

"We are delighted that Dr. Lo has accepted this critical and demanding
position," said Giacconi. "The national and international scientific
community is indeed fortunate to have an astronomer of this caliber
directing the NRAO as it begins a new era of exploration and discovery."

Martha P. Haynes of Cornell University, and chairman of the AUI Board of
Trustees, points out the AUI Board's strong endorsement of Lo's appointment
to lead the NRAO. "As an active radio astronomer, university professor, and
director of an institute that is working on a number of novel projects, Fred
Lo has distinguished himself as a leading figure in the United States and
international astronomical communities," she said.

Lo received his bachelor's and doctorate degrees in Physics from the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1969 and 1974, respectively. He
joined the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in 1974 as a
Research Fellow in Radio Astronomy. In 1976, Lo went to the University of
California at Berkeley as a Miller Fellow. Two years later, he returned to
Caltech where he held various research and teaching positions until 1986.

In 1986, Lo accepted the position of Professor of Astronomy at the
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and served as the chairman of
that university's astronomy department from 1995 to 1997. Lo accepted his
current position at the Academia Sinica in 1997. He also accepted the post
of Professor of Physics at the National Taiwan University in 1998.

Lo is an accomplished radio astronomer with very wide research interests.
His studies include star formation in different environments, such as dwarf
galaxies; starbursts in nearby and very distant galaxies; and the
determination of the structure of Sagittarius A, the compact radio source at
the center of the Milky Way Galaxy. He has been intimately involved in the
construction and scientific use of all the millimeter-wave and
sub-millimeter-wave interferometer arrays in the United States, and has made
the first millimeter-wave interferometric map of carbon dioxide emission
from an external galaxy. More recently, he has been leading an effort in
Taiwan to build an array to study the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation
-- the echo of the Big Bang.

In coming to NRAO, Lo will direct the daily operation and formulate the
long-term goals of one of the world's leading astronomical observatories.
NRAO's facilities include the Very Long Baseline Array, ten remotely
controlled radio telescopes that work together as the world's largest,
full-time astronomical instrument; the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope,
the world's largest fully steerable radio telescope; and the Very Large
Array, the most productive astronomical instrument on Earth. The VLA
currently is undergoing a multi-year enhancement and expansion project.
Also, NRAO is proceeding together with international partners in the
construction of the Atacama Large Millimeter Array, an array of 64, 12-meter
millimeter-wave antennas to be constructed in the high Atacama plateau of
northern Chile.

Vanden Bout will continue working on developing this instrument as the Joint
ALMA Office's interim director. After which he will undertake a research
sabbatical and then return to the NRAO's research staff.

"The legacy left behind by Paul Vanden Bout is remarkable," said Lo. "I look
forward to the challenge and opportunity of continuing the outstanding
operation of NRAO, while working to ensure the scientific and technological
excellence of the observatory."

"Paul Vanden Bout has brought the observatory extraordinary success under
his leadership," said Giacconi. "The international astronomical community
has benefitted greatly by his vision and leadership, and we are pleased to
build on that outstanding foundation as NRAO moves into a new era under Lo's
direction."

The NRAO is headquartered in Charlottesville, Virginia. The NRAO operates
three principal sites in Green Bank, West Virginia; Tucson, Arizona; and
Socorro, New Mexico. The observatory is charged with providing astronomers
with access to state-of-the-art radio telescope facilities, which they use
to conduct forefront astronomical research. Under its charge, the
observatory constructs and operates unique facilities and designs future
ones to provide maximal observing capability to the astronomical community.
