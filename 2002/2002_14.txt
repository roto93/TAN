{\LARGE \bf EDITORIAL}
\bigskip

\noindent This 7th issue is special in that it should be the very last one 
managed from the ARI in Heidelberg. 
We are grateful to R. Spurzem and R. Wielen for the 
smooth running and usage of computer facilities during this first year of SCYON. 

We had announced a move to Strasbourg on this page last time. We will get there 
eventually, but we decided to upgrade the home page on the same occasion and that 
means a little thinking is required. That translates to much time, usually. 
By issue no. 8 we will have a brand new site.  And hopefully bug-free. 

On another note. We have noticed that submissions to SCYON are more and more 
done through the web outlet. This is great,  as it makes our life simpler. But we 
have also noticed that the field of `cluster identification' on the form is 
not regularly used. This is an important field, because with this information we 
can link up your abstract to the WEBDA dataset. Future developments may link 
these objects back to your abstract, or to other datasets. We hope this provides 
some motivation for contributors to use this field. 

Another area where we would like to see an improvement is in the sorting of abstracts 
by fields of interests. We would like 
to remind everyone that SCYON is concerned with any aspect of cluster research, 
and we have identified as fields of interest 

          A) Star forming region ; 
          B) Embedded clusters ;
          C) Galactic open clusters  ;
          D) Galactic globular clusters ; 
          E) Galactic center clusters ; 
          F) SMC clusters ; 
          G) LMC clusters ; 
          H) Extra-galactic clusters ; 
          I) Cluster formation ; 
          J) Dynamical evolution - simulations ;
          K) Miscellaneous. 

If you include with your abstract a line such as $\backslash$keyword\{\}, with the 
name of clusters and the field of interest (A-K above) mentioned in brackets, 
this will 
help us assess which fields are relevant to our aims. We will remind 
the contributors when possible.

\section*{{\LARGE \bf SCYON POLICY}} 
\label{page:policy} 
%========================================================================


       The {\sc SCYON} Newsletter publishes abstracts from any area in astronomy which are relevant to research on star clusters. We welcome all
       contributions. Topics to be covered include 

\begin{enumerate} 
           \item Abstracts from refereed articles 
           \item Abstracts from conference proceedings 
           \item PhD summaries 
           \item General announcements : Conferences, new databases, and the likes. 
\end{enumerate} 

       Concerning possible infringements to copyright laws, we understand that the authors themselves are taking responsibility for the
       material they send us. We make no claim whatsoever to owning the material that is posted at our url or circulated by email. The
       newsletter SCYON is a free service. It does not substitute for our personal opinions, nor does it reflect in any way
       the views of our respective institutes of affiliations. \newline 


{\sc SCYON} will be published initially 
once every two months. If the number of contributions justifies 
monthly installments, we will move toward more frequent issues in order to 
keep the newsletter relatively short, manageable for us, and up-to-date. 


       Conference and journal abstracts can be submitted 
at any time either by web
       download, or failing this, we also accept abstracts 
typeset using the latest latex abstract template (available from the {\sc SCYON} web-page). 
We much prefer contributors to use the direct download form, since it is mostly automated. Abstracts will normally appear on the website as soon as they are submitted  to us. Other contributions, such as PhD summaries, 
should be sent to us using the LaTeX template. {\it Please
do not submit postscript files, nor encoded abstracts as e-mail
attachments}.

  All abstracts/contributions will be processed, but we 
reserve the right to not post abstracts submitted in the wrong
       format or which do not compile. If you experience any sort of problems accessing the web site, or with the LaTeX template, 
please  write to us at scyon@ari.uni-heidelberg.de. 

       A ``Call for abstracts'' is sent out approximately one week before the next issue of the newsletter is finalised. This call contains the
       deadline for abstract submissions for that coming issue and the LaTeX abstract template. 
\newline 

       Depending on circumstances, the editors might actively solicit contributions, usually those spotted on a preprint server, but they do not
       publish abstracts without the author's consent. 

       We implicitly encourage further dissemination of the letter to institutes and astronomers who may benefit from it.

A systolic algorithm rhythmically computes and passes data through
a network of processors.
We investigate the performance of systolic
algorithms for implementing the gravitational
$N$-body problem on distributed-memory computers.
Systolic algorithms minimize memory requirements
by distributing the particles between processors.
We show that the performance of systolic routines
can be greatly enhanced by the use of
non-blocking communication, which allows particle
coordinates to be communicated at the same time
that force calculations are being carried out.
The performance enhancement is particularly great when
block sizes are small, i.e. when only a small fraction
of the $N$ particles need their forces computed in
each time step.
Hyper-systolic algorithms reduce the communication
complexity from $O(N_p)$, with $p$ the processor
number, to $O(\sqrt{N_p})$, at the expense of increased
memory demands.
We describe a hyper-systolic algorithm that will work
with a block time step algorithm and analyze its performance.
As an example of an application requiring large $N$,
we use the systolic algorithm to carry out direct-summation
simulations using $10^6$ particles of the Brownian motion
of the supermassive black hole at the center of the
Milky Way galaxy.

\medskip

In this paper we  present and analyze new CCD $UBVRI$ photometry
down to $V~\approx$~21 in the region of the
young open cluster Trumpler~15, located in the Carina spiral feature.
The cluster is rather compact and has a core radius of about 2$^{\prime}$, which translates
in about 1 pc at the distance of the cluster.
We provide the first CCD investigation and update its fundamental parameters.
We identify 90 candidate photometric members on the base of the position in
the color-color and  color-magnitude diagrams.
This sample allows us to obtain
a distance of 2.4$\pm$0.3 kpc from the Sun and a reddening
E$(B-V)$~=0.52$\pm0.07$.
We confirm that the cluster is young, and fix
a upper limit of 6 million yrs to its age .\\
In addition, we draw the attention on the lower part of the Main
Sequence (MS) suggesting that some stars can be in contracting phase and
on a gap in the MS, that we show to be a real feature,
the $B1-B5$ gap found in other young open clusters.\\
We finally study in details the extinction toward Trumpler~15 concluding
that it is normal and suggesting a value of 2.89$\pm$0.

\medskip

 We present CCD UBVI observations obtained in the field
of the two previously unstudied dissolving open cluster candidates NGC~7036
and NGC~7772. Our analysis suggests that  both the objects are Open
Cluster Remnants (OCR).\\
NGC~7036 is an open
cluster remnant with a core radius of about 3-4 arcmin.
We derive for the first time
estimates of its fundamental parameters. We identify 17 likely members
which define a group  of stars at 1 kpc from the Sun,
with a low reddening E$(B-V) \approx 0.1$,and with an age of about 3-4 Gyr.\\
As for NGC~7772, we identify 14 likely members, which define
a group of stars with a very low reddening (E$(B-V) \approx 0.03$), 1.5 Gyr old
and located about 1.5 kpc from the Sun.

\par
\medskip

We report on $UBVRI$ CCD photometry of two overlapping fields
in the region of
the intermediate-age open cluster NGC~2158 down to $V=21$.
By analyzing Colour-Colour (CC) and Colour-Magnitude Diagrams (CMD) we
infer a reddening $E_{B-V}=
0.55\pm0.10$, a distance of $3600 \pm 400$ pc, and an age
of about 2 Gyr. Synthetic CMDs performed with these parameters
(but fixing $E_{B-V}=0.60$ and $[{\rm Fe/H}]=-0.60$),
and including binaries, field contamination, and photometric errors,
allow a good description of the observed CMD.
The elongated shape of the clump of red giants in the CMD
is interpreted as resulting from a differential reddening of about
$\Delta E_{B-V}=0.06$ across the cluster, in the direction
perpendicular to the Galactic plane.
NGC~2158 turns out to be an intermediate-age open cluster
with an anomalously low  metal  content.The combination of these
parameters together with the analysis of the cluster orbit,
suggests that the cluster belongs to the old thin disk population.

We analyze the structural parameters of the largest-available sample of spatially
resolved extragalactic globular clusters. The images of M31 GCs were found in
a search of HST archival data, described in a companion paper.
We measure the ellipticities and position angles of the clusters and conclude
that the ellipticities are consistent with being caused by rotation.
We find that most clusters' surface brightness distributions are
well-fit by two-dimensional single-mass Michie-King models. A few clusters
show possible power-law distributions characteristic of core-collapse, but the
spatial resolution is not high enough to make definitive claims.
As has been found for other galaxies, the metal-rich clusters
are slightly smaller than the metal-poor clusters.
There are strong correlations between structural properties of M31
GCs, as for Milky Way clusters, and the two populations are
located close to the same `fundamental plane' in parameter space.

We present new HST I-band images of a sample of 77 nearby, late-type spiral galaxies with low inclination. The
main purpose of this catalog is to study the frequency and properties of nuclear star clusters. In 59 galaxies of our
sample, we have identified a distinct, compact (but resolved), and dominant source at or very close to their
photocenter. In many cases, these clusters are the only prominent source within a few kpc from the galaxy nucleus.
We present surface brightness profiles, derived from elliptical isophote fits, of all galaxies for which the fit was
successful. We use the fitted isophotes at radii larger than 2" to check whether the location of the cluster coincides
with the photocenter of the galaxy, and confirm that in nearly all cases, we are truly dealing with ``nuclear'' star
clusters. From analytical fits to the surface brightness profiles, we derive the cluster luminosities after subtraction of
the light contribution from the underlying galaxy disk and/or bulge.

We present timing analysis results for Rossi x-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) observations of x-ray binary source 4U 1820$-$30 located in the globular cluster NGC 6624. The light curves of observations made between October 1996 and September 1997 show that the maximum of the 685s binary period modulation folded by the linear ephemeris from previous observations has phase shift of $-$0.20 $\pm$ 0.06.  Combined with historical results (1976-1997), the binary period derivative is measured to be $\dot P / P =(-3.47 \pm 1.48) \times 10^{-8}$ yr$^{-1}$.  The previous known ($\sim$176 d) long-term modulation is significant in the x-ray light curve obtained by analysis of the RXTE
All-Sky Monitor (ASM) during the  years 1996-2000. The RXTE/ASM ephemeris is extended by analysis of all historical data (Vela 5B and Ginga) to yield a period 171.033$\pm$0.326 days with no evidence for period change ($|{\dot{P}/ {P}}| < 2.20 \times 10^{-4}$ yr$^{-1}$). All reported x-ray burst activity is confined to within $\pm$23 d of the predicted minima.  This stable long-term modulation is consistent with 4U 1820$-$30 being a hierarchical triple system with a $\sim$1.1
d period companion.

{\Large \bf  Thickening of galactic disks through clustered star formation }
\end{center}

\begin{center}
{\bf Pavel Kroupa }


{\footnotesize  University of Kiel }
\end{center}

\par
\medskip

The building blocks of galaxies are star clusters. These form with
low-star formation efficiencies and, consequently, loose a large part
of their stars that expand outwards once the residual gas is expelled
by the action of the massive stars. Massive star clusters may thus add
kinematically hot components to galactic field populations.  This
kinematical imprint on the stellar distribution function is estimated
here by calculating the velocity distribution function for ensembles
of star-clusters distributed as power-law or log-normal initial
cluster mass functions (ICMFs). The resulting stellar velocity
distribution function is non-Gaussian and may be interpreted as being
composed of multiple kinematical sub-populations.

The velocity-dispersion of solar-neighbourhood stars increases more
rapidly with stellar age than theoretical calculations of orbital
diffusion predict. Interpreting this difference to arise from star
formation characterised by larger cluster masses, rather than as yet
unknown stellar-dynamical heating mechanisms, suggests that the star
formation rate in the MW disk has been quietening down, or at least
shifting towards less-massive star-forming units.  Thin-disk stars
with ages 3--7~Gyr may have formed from an ICMF extending to very rich
Galactic clusters.  Stars appear to be forming preferentially in
modest embedded clusters during the past~3~Gyr.

Applying this approach to the ancient thick disk of the Milky Way, it
follows that its large velocity dispersion may have been produced
through a high star formation rate and thus an ICMF extending to
massive embedded clusters ($\approx10^{5-6}\,M_\odot$), even under the
extreme assumption that early star formation occurred in a thin
gas-rich disk. This enhanced star-formation episode in an early thin
Galactic disk could have been triggered by passing satellite galaxies,
but direct satellite infall into the disk may not be required for disk
heating.

The distribution of stellar masses that form in one star-formation
event in a given volume of space is called the initial mass function
(IMF). The IMF has been estimated from low-mass brown dwarfs to very
massive stars. Combining IMF estimates for different populations in
which the stars can be observed individually unveils an extraordinary
uniformity of the IMF. This general insight appears to hold for
populations including present-day star formation in small molecular
clouds, rich and dense massive star-clusters forming in giant clouds,
through to ancient and metal-poor exotic stellar populations that may
be dominated by dark matter.  This apparent universality of the IMF is
a challenge for star formation theory because elementary
considerations suggest that the IMF ought to systematically vary with
star-forming conditions.

We present multiple-epoch radial-velocity observations for 104 stars
in a $10'\times 10'$ 
field of the intermediate-age open cluster IC4651 to $V \sim 14.5$.
Only 13 stars (13 \%) of the full sample are field stars. From the 44 single
member stars we find a mean radial velocity of $-30.76 \pm 0.20$ km/s, and
the 12 single red-giant members yield a true radial-velocity dispersion
of $0.74$ km/s. Of the 19 giant members, 7 (37\%) are spectroscopic binaries
with periods up to 5000 days, while 35 (52\%) of the 67 main-sequence and
turnoff members are binaries with periods less than $\sim 1000$ days. Combined
with our deep, accurate CCD Str{\"o}mgren photometry in a $\sim 21'x21'$ field
of IC4651 (Meibom 2000), these data substantially improve the definition
of the cluster locus in the colour-magnitude diagram and the spatial structure
of the cluster, although the photometry shows that IC4651 contains at
least twice as many stars on the upper main sequence as believed when
the radial-velocity survey was initiated. The single cluster members define
a very tight sequence in the CMD, and two sets of isochrones from stellar
models with convective overshooting $(d/H_p = 0.2)$ have been fit to it. Our
best estimate for the age of IC4651 is $1.7 \pm 0.15$ Gyr, assuming [Fe/H] =
0.12 (Hyades) and $E_{(b-y)} = 0.071$.

Including the $\sim 650$ stars newly discovered from the photometry,
we estimate the present total mass of IC4651 to be $\sim 630 M_\odot$ 
excluding any undetected stellar remnants. The corresponding tidal cutoff
radius is $\sim 22'$. 
IC4651 shows evidence of moderate mass segregation: Most of
the turn-off stars and nearly all the red giants are located at radii smaller
than $\sim 7'$, 
while the lower main-sequence stars are less centrally concentrated.
The spatial distributions of cluster and field stars indicate that additional
cluster stars are probably still to be found outside the fields studied so far.
Comparison of the present mass function of IC4651 with plausible initial
mass functions indicates that the cluster initially contained at least
stars only $\sim 7\%$, containing $\sim 12\%$ 
of the initial mass, remain today. Of the
initial cluster mass, $\sim 35\%$ 
 has been lost due to evolution of the most massive
stars into white dwarfs or other remnants while the remaining $\sim 53\%$, 
comprising
field or been lost from the cluster altogether. IC4651 is currently 1 kpc
closer to the Galactic center than its ``sister'' cluster NGC 3680
(Nordstrom et al. 1997), but their Galactic orbital parameters indicate
that the mean orbital radius of IC4651 is in fact larger by 0.7 kpc,
providing a plausible reason why it is much less advanced in its dynamical
evolution than the coeval cluster NGC 3680.

In order to estimate the masses of the compact, young star clusters in the merging galaxy pair, NGC 4038/4039 (``the Antennae''), we have obtained medium and high resolution spectroscopy using ISAAC on VLT-UT1 and UVES on VLT-UT2 of five such clusters.  The velocity dispersions were estimated using the stellar absorption features of CO at 2.29 $\mu$m and metal absorption lines at around 8500 \AA, including lines of
the Calcium Triplet.  The size scales and light profiles were measured from HST images.  From these data and assuming Virial equilibrium, we estimated the masses of five clusters.  The resulting masses range from 6.5 $\times$ 10$^5$ to 4.7 $\times$ 10$^6$ M$_{\odot}$.  These masses are large, factor of a few to more than 10 larger than the typical mass of a
globular cluster in the Milky Way.   The mass-to-light ratios for these clusters in the V- and K-bands in comparison with stellar synthesis models suggest
that to first order the IMF slopes are approximately consistent with Salpeter for a mass range of 0.1 to 100 M$_{\odot}$.  However, the clusters show a significant range of possible IMF slopes or lower mass cut-offs and that these variations may correlate with the interstellar environment of the cluster.  Comparison with the results of Fokker-Planck simulations of compact clusters with properties similar to the clusters studied here, suggest that they are likely to be long-lived and may lose a substantial fraction of their total mass. This mass loss would make the star clusters obtain masses which are comparable to the typical mass of a globular cluster.
