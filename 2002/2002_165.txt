Subject: 2MASS All-Sky Quicklook Images now available

The Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) is pleased to announce that the 2MASS
Quicklook Images covering the full sky are now available on-line.  A
description of the Quicklook Images, cautionary notes about their use and a
gallery of known Anomalies in the Images can be found at the 2MASS All-Sky
Data Release page at http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/2mass/releases/allsky/.

The Quicklook Images are renditions of the 1"/pixel J, H and Ks FITS-format
2MASS Atlas Images that have been passed through a data compression algorithm
that causes some loss of intensity information.  The Quicklook Images are not
recommended for quantitative photometric measurements, but they contain full
astrometric information and are useful for visual examination of the near
infrared sky and as finding chart material.  Users should defer to the
2MASS Point and Extended Source Catalogs for measurements of discrete sources.

The Quicklook Images serve as a preview of the release of the 2MASS All-Sky
Point and Extended Source Catalogs that contain approximately 470 million
sources.  The All-Sky Catalogs are in the final stages of validation before
their impending release.

Interactive access to the 4,121,439 2MASS Images is available via the
position/object-based All-Sky Quicklook Image Server at the Infrared Science
Archive (IRSA;  http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu).  Batch retrieval of Quicklook
Images will be available in the near future.  The non-lossy-compressed 2MASS
Atlas Images will be available in 2003.
