Dear Colleagues,

Please forward the following announcement to possibly interested students:
Ph. D. position in astrochemistry and atmospheric chemistry at Stockholm
University - Application deadline in 4 days!

A 4-years position of a Ph. D. student in the field of astrochemistry and
molecular astrophysics is available at Stockholm University under the
supervision of Prof. Wolf D. Geppert. The work will focus on the
investigations of ion reactions in the interstellar medium and planetary
ionospheres trough experimental and theoretical methods. The focus will be on:

  * Identification of products of ion-ion reactions relevant for the
interstellar medium and planetary ionospheres using the novel and unique
DESIREE double storage ring in Stockholm
  * Studies of atmospheric and interstellar ion-neutral reactions of ions using
guided beams. In a collaboration composed of the Universities of Trento,
J. Heyrovsk' Institute (Prague), Universit Paris Saclay, and and SU we will
pursue the selective generation of specific isomers of ions and investigations
of their reactions with common molecules in Titan=92s atmosphere.
  * Spectroscopic studies of isomeric ions With the help the ion trap
experiment at the FELIX free electron laser at the University of Nijmegen
infrared spectra of isomeric cations will be measured in order to establish
selective production procedures of their isomers.
  * Furthermore, we envisage planning of rocket- and balloon-based missions to
assess the abundance, identity and distribution of cluster ions in Earth's
atmosphere and their possible role in aerosol formation. The experimental and
modelling studies to be carried out regarding ion clusters will identify the
build-up and destruction processes of ionospheric clusters, predict their
abundances and thus be of fundamental help in preparing a scientific case for
such missions.
  * The results of these investigations will be used as input data of model
calculations of dark interstellar clouds and planetary or satellite atmospheres
and for astronomic observations. The successful candidate will be offered
full-time employment with a competitive salary and full medical and social
security coverage. Also, the Stockholm University Astrobiology Centre has some
funds for travel.

procedures and rules:

The position is advertised under the heading "PhD student in studies of
Isomeric Interstellar and Atmospheric Ions and their Reactions"
