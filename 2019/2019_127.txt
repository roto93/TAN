Arizona Radio Observatory: Call for Proposals (2019A)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dear Astronomers and Astrophysicists of Taiwan,

The Arizona Radio Observatory (ARO) solicits observing proposals for the ALMA
Prototype 12-meter Telescope (12m) located on Kitt Peak, Arizona, and for the
10-meter Submillimeter Telescope (SMT) located on Mount Graham, Arizona, for
the period October 15, 2019 - February 15, 2019. Proposal candidates from
members of the University Consortium of ALMA-Taiwan (UCAT) and ASIAA should
submit up to THREE pages of scientific and technical justification (including
figures, tables, and references) in addition to their Proposal Summary Sheet
(download 2019B form form here):
https://www.as.arizona.edu/sites/default/files/ARO_Proposal_Cover_Sheet.pdf

All proposal candidates are required to list on the 2019B Proposal Summary
Sheet their requested observing blocks (the exact LST ranges to be scheduled
and number of times to be repeated), dates on which they are NOT available to
observe, and dates in which sources in those observing blocks are within the
Sun-avoidance zone (45 degrees at the SMT, 10 degrees at the 12m).

The 12m ALMA Prototype antenna currently supports dual-polarization sideband-
separating (SBS) observations in three bands: 4mm (66-90 GHz), 3mm (84-116GHz),
and 1mm (211-275 GHz). Observations with the new 4mm and 1mm receivers are
shared-risk for the 2019B season.  The 12m control system supports dual-
polarization in the same sideband or single-polarization in each sideband ("2
IF mode"; fixed 6.0 GHz IF frequency), position-switched, beam-switched, and
OTF observations. Backend modes for the AROWS spectrometer may be found on the
ARO Equipment Summary and Status sheet at:
https://www.as.arizona.edu/arizona-radio-observatory

The 10m SMT currently supports a dual-polarization sideband-separating (SBS)
observations at 1mm (211 - 280 GHz) and dual-polarization double sideband
observations at 0.8mm (325 - 370 GHz).  The SMT is the preferred site for 1mm
observations.  The SMT control system supports both dual-polarization ("2 IF
mode") and dual-polarization + dual-sideband observations ("4 IF mode") with
tunable IF from 4.5 - 7.5 GHz, for position-switched, beam-switched, and OTF
observations.  Proposal candidates should consult the ARO Equipment Summary
and Status sheet for additional technical specifications at:
https://www.as.arizona.edu/arizona-radio-observatory

Remote observing is available. Observers who plan to observe remotely must
supply fixed IP address(es) of the computer(s) that will be used during
observing on their Proposal Summary Sheet. For further information about remote
observing and other operational questions, please contact Tom Folkers, ARO
Software Engineer: tfolkers@email.arizona.edu

Scheduling of successful proposals will be done according to availability of the
receivers requested.  Graduate student participation is especially encouraged.
Proposals should be emailed in PDF format to kuan[at]asiaa.sinica.edu.tw by
midnight (23:59 CST) September 09, 2019 (Monday).

Dear colleagues,

We have a numerical astrophysics summer school on astrophysical fluids in
early September (9/4 - 9/6).
You are welcome to register. The deadline for registration is on August
15th.

https://nctsmma.github.io/events/201909-naschool/

In this 3-day school, we will introduce the basic theory of fluid dynamics
and simulations of hydrodynamics. The program of the school consists of
five lectures and five hands-on Lab sessions. Participants can expect to
learn how to perform basic hydrodynamic simulations with FLASH code, and
work together in a group of 2-4 people on a specific small scientific
project.

> Dear Colleagues,
> The SMA is a reconfigurable interferometric array of eight 6-meter =
antennas on Maunakea jointly built and operated by the Smithsonian =
Astrophysical Observatory and the Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy =
and Astrophysics. The array operates in the 230, 345, and 400 GHz bands.
>=20
> We are happy to announce that we are now accepting Standard Proposals =
for use of the Submillimeter Array (SMA).  The deadline for Standard =
Proposals is 5 September 2019 at 20:00 GMT.
>=20
> The SMA has recently completed significant upgrades in observational =
capability, with more under way. Currently, the SMA observes =
simultaneously with two orthogonally polarized receivers, one in the 230 =
GHz or 345 GHz band and the other in the 240 GHz or 400 GHz band (with =
full polarimetric observations available using the 230+240 GHz or =
345+400 GHz combinations).
>=20
> The SWARM correlator processes 8 GHz bandwidth for each receiver in =
each sideband, for a total of 32 GHz, at a uniform 140 kHz resolution. =
This 32 GHz frequency coverage can be continuous where the tuning ranges =
overlap for the two orthogonally polarized receivers. In short, the SMA =
now provides flexible, wide band frequency coverage that delivers high =
continuum sensitivity and excellent spectral line capabilities (at 140 =
kHz spectral resolution).
>=20
> A full track offers continuum sensitivity of 250 or 600 micro-Jy (1 =
sigma) at 230 or 345 GHz in good weather conditions (precipitable water =
vapor 2.5 mm and 1.0 mm, respectively). The corresponding line =
sensitivities at 1 km/s resolution are 35 and 80 mJy. The small antennas =
allow access to low spatial frequencies in the subcompact configuration, =
and at the other extreme, the finest angular resolution with the very =
extended configuration at 345 GHz is ~0.25". The compact and extended =
configurations complete the range.
>=20
> The characteristics and performance of the SMA are both similar and =
complementary to those of the standalone Atacama Compact Array component =
of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. For more =
information about SMA capabilities, visit the SMA Observer Center =
website <http://sma1.sma.hawaii.edu/status.html> and explore the set of =
SMA proposing tools <http://sma1.sma.hawaii.edu/tools.html>. Current and =
archived SMA Newsletters <https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/sma/Newsletters/> =
