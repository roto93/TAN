2020A CALL FOR PROPOSALS INAF - RADIO TELESCOPES


-- DEADLINE 3.10.2019 12:00 CET--


The Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica (INAF) invites scientists to
participate in the call for proposals of observing time at the three
national radio telescopes:

- the 32-m Medicina antenna
- the 32-m Noto antenna
- the 64-m Sardinia Radio Telescope

Two observing semesters are scheduled every year: 1st January to 30th June,
1st July to 31st December.
Deadlines fall in early October and early April, respectively.


The three telescopes can be used as single dishes for spectroscopic and
 continuum observations as well as for VLBI, outside the standard networks
coordination (EVN, IVS, etc.) which have their own time allocations.

VLBI proposers must take care of organising the availability of
international telescopes if needed by their observations. The presence of
observers at SRT is also requested. They are also required to contact the
antenna staff prior to submission, in order to assess the availability of
software/hardware services for their specific needs.

Some SRT configurations are offered in shared risk mode, please take this
into account when preparing the proposal and contact SRT team before
submitting the proposal.
SRT staff may be able to offer support for external proposer/observer, you
can contact them for details.

Instructions on the submission procedure and characteristics of the
instruments currently available can be found at

http://www.radiotelescopes.inaf.it/proposal_main.html


A dedicated help desk for the submission only may be reached via e-mail at
radioproposal@inaf.it

The proposals will be peer-reviewed and should be submitted before
12:00 CET of October 3rd, 2019.

Below we report the time INAF plans to award for the next semester 2020A:

Medicina: 2500 hours
Noto: 2000 hours
SRT: 1500 hours

These amounts might be subject to modification, due to maintenance needs
and to the variability of the commitments resulting from international
agreements.


** NOTICE

According to the MOU between INAF and KASI up to 30hrs of observing time in
VLBI mode are allocated to approved eating VLBI projects. These projects
have to be submitted both to the Italian and Korean TACs with the standard
form selecting "Eating VLBI mode" in the project type. Approved projects
will be observed up to 30hrs/semester.
Projects exceeding 30 hours will be scheduled together with all other
projects according to their relative grades.
PIs of these proposals must be associated with INAF or KASI.

**

Please, feel free to distribute the present call to anyone interested
Best regards,
