Topic:          The planetary nebula HuBi 1, a rebel with a cause
Time:           3/18 (Monday) 12:15 - 13:15
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Planetary nebulae, the descendants of low- and intermediate-mass stars, have characteristic onion-like ionization structure, with the highest ionization species closer to the central star. This is true for all planetary nebulae, but HuBi 1, which shows an inverted ionization inner shell. There is a reason for this oddity, a peculiar stellar evolution of its central star, which makes HuBi 1 the missing link of the population of cool C-rich central stars of planetary nebulae.

Speaker:        Yi-Kuan Chiang (JHU)
Topic:          How Dark is the Universe? Intensity Mapping in Broadband and Beyond
Time:           3/19 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Why is the night sky dark if the universe is filled with stars? As modern cosmology has linked this ancient observation to a profound implication that the age of the universe is finite, naturally the next question to ask is: How dark is the universe? To address this, we aim for measuring the extragalactic background light (EBL) budget as a function of redshift and frequency. I will discuss the state of the art in EBL constraints, focusing on the sky monopole intensities in wide-field broadband surveys across the electromagnetic spectrum. I then introduce a method to recover previously collapsed redshift information in these broadband intensity mapping datasets, and further show that one can even retrieve sub-bandpass frequency information to probe the spectrum of the universe. I will demonstrate this method by probing the continuum, LyÎ±, and Lyman break in the cosmic UV background up to z~2 using GALEX imaging. This allows us to perform spectral diagnostics for the entire b!
 ody of the UV background and provide insights on cosmic star-formation, black hole accretion, and potential emission from the diffuse intergalactic medium. I will conclude with a discussion of prospects of intensity mapping in broadband, grism spectroscopy, time domain, and multi-messenger astronomy.

Speaker:        Kathryn Volk (University of Arizona)
Topic:          Combining theory and observations of trans-Neptunian objects to pin down Neptuneâ€™s migration history
Time:           3/20 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
The current orbital structure of the trans-Neptunian region holds the key to understanding how the giant planets migrated to their present-day orbits. In particular, the population of trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) captured into orbital resonance with Neptune during migration are capable of recording properties of that migration. There are, however, challenges in observationally constraining the current distribution of resonant TNOs, determining which resonant TNOs were likely captured during migration, and in generalizing theoretical studies and numerical simulations of resonant capture during migration. I will discuss some of my recent and ongoing investigations into these challenges. I will discuss recent modeling of the transient resonant TNO populations and how this can inform the interpretation of observationally derived resonant TNO population models. I will also present the results of investigations into how Neptuneâ€™s migration characteristics affect the distributi!
 ons of primordially captured TNOs in the 3:2 and 2:1 resonance; some of these results offer counterpoints to recent investigations in the literature, highlighting the difficulty of uniquely constraining Neptuneâ€™s migration based on numerical investigations. I will end by discussing current and future observational investigations that will help guide further theoretical work.

Topic:          Galaxy mergers in the nearby Universe
Time:           3/21 (Thursday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Astronomy's current model of galaxy evolution is built on a foundation of hierarchical growth, in which small galaxies merge together to form larger ones.  In addition to the simple accrual of mass, this merging process is predicted to fundamentally change the galaxiesâ€™ properties, such as dramatic morphological transformations, the triggering of bursts of star formation and high rates of accretion onto the central supermassive black hole.  In this talk I will explain the physical processes behind these predictions, and present the observations that we are performing in order to test the theory.  Although many of the predictions are indeed borne out by experiment, there have been some surprising conflicts as well, that demand revisions to our models of how mergers shape galaxy evolution.

Title: Combining theory and observations of trans-Neptunian objects to pin
down Neptune=E2=80=99s
                  migration history

Abstract:

The current orbital structure of the trans-Neptunian region holds the key
to understanding how the giant planets migrated to their present-day
orbits. In particular, the population of trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs)
captured into orbital resonance with Neptune during migration are capable
of recording properties of that migration. There are, however, challenges
in observationally constraining the current distribution of resonant TNOs,
determining which resonant TNOs were likely captured during migration, and
in generalizing theoretical studies and numerical simulations of resonant
capture during migration. I will discuss some of my recent and ongoing
investigations into these challenges. I will discuss recent modeling of the
transient resonant TNO populations and how this can inform the
interpretation of observationally derived resonant TNO population models. I
will also present the results of investigations into how Neptune=E2=80=99s
migration characteristics affect the distributions of primordially captured
TNOs in the 3:2 and 2:1 resonance; some of these results offer
counterpoints to recent investigations in the literature, highlighting the
difficulty of uniquely constraining Neptune=E2=80=99s migration based on nu=
merical
investigations. I will end by discussing current and future observational
investigations that will help guide further theoretical work.

[Rationale]
Subaru Telescope is the 8.2-meter flagship optical-infrared telescope
of the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan, located at the
MaunaKea Observatory on Hawaii.  Since its scientific first light in
1999, Subaru has been expanding our understanding of the universe with
remarkable results in various research fields from our solar system
all the way out to the earliest Universe.
This symposium will celebrate the 20th anniversary of Subaru and
highlight our recent scientific outcomes in parallel sessions.  We
also aim to share and discuss the on-going/future large programs (to
be) conducted on Subaru Telescope including international
collaborations in the general session.  The Subaru User¡¦s Meeting
FY2019 will also be combined with this conference.

[Key topics of the General Session]
- Subaru User's Meeting FY2019 (Business session)
- Subaru Strategic Programs (HSC, IRD, PFS)
- International partnership
- Synergy with Space and TMT

[Scientific Parallel Sessions]
- Solar System
- Exoplanet and Star Formation
- Local Group and Nearby Galaxies
- Galaxy Formation
- Supermassive Black Holes
- Time Domain
