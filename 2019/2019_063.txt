Call for Proposals 2019B (KVN VLBI)

--------------------------------------

The Korean VLBI Network (KVN) invites proposals for open-use VLBI
observations during the 2019B season. Observations of successful proposals
will be scheduled between 16th August 2019 and 15th January 2020. Proposals
should be submitted to the KVN website (https://kvn.kasi.re.kr) before the
deadline of 3 June 2019, UT 08:00 (KST 17:00).


 Korean VLBI Network (KVN)

The Korean VLBI Network (KVN) is a dedicated mm-VLBI network, operated by
the Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute (KASI, http://www.kasi.re.kr).
Its three 21m radio telescopes are located around South Korea in Seoul,
Ulsan, and Jeju Island. The baseline length ranges from 305 km to 476 km
and its 4-channel receiving system allows simultaneous observation at 22,
43, 86, and 129 GHz. Higher than 1 Gbps recording rates (e.g., 2, 4 and 8
Gbps) using Mark6 recorder are also available. Total time of 300 hours is
allocated for the 2019B season. The maximum observation time for a proposal
is limited to 100 hours. If requested, the observation time can allocated
over a year until 15th June 2020, however, the total observation time is
still limited to 100 hours even in this case. Details of information and
current status of the KVN can be found in the KVN VLBI Status Report (
https://radio.kasi.re.kr/kvn/status_report_2019/array.html).


Proposers should use the KVN VLBI observing application form which is
available at the KVN website. Please carefully follow the instructions of
the proposal form. A separate scientific and technical justification is
mandatory. This Justification should be submitted together with the
proposal form and not exceed 3 pages.

> Subject: NEP meeting 2019 at NTHU Taiwan
> Date: Tue, 16 Apr 2019 10:01:49 +0800

Dear all,

We will have a conference titled
'Future Science with Multi-Wavelength Data: NEP meeting 2019'
on 24-26 June at NTHU.

We would like to announce that the conference website is now open
(https://seongini.wixsite.com/nepconf2). Please visit the registration
page and make sure to register first!

The science on the NEP field with the AKARI space telescope is turning
into a new era.Â  Currently, our deep HSC imaging data covering the entire
NEP-Wide field has become available. The SCUBA2 survey program to
cover the same area is still going on.Â  A collaboration to carry out a 
massive
spectroscopic survey using the new Subaru/PFS is also on-going. From the
space,Â  Euclid, SPHEREx, and eROSTA will cover the field in near-IR and
X-ray.

The AKARI's NEP legacy will remain the only survey having continuous
mid-IR bands data over 5 sq. deg.Â  This legacy will continue to grow with
a lot more multi-wavelength data.Â  Time is ripe for top scientists to meet
again to pave the bright future of the NEP field science. We are looking
forward to seeing you here, in Hsinchu!

Best Regards,
Seong-Jin,Â  on behalf of LOC.

***************************************
Call for Proposals of VERA
Deadline;  June 03, 2019, 08:00 UT.
***************************************

We wish to inform you call for proposals of VERA; VLBI exploration of
Radio Astrometry.  VERA is a Japanese VLBI network, which has
four 20-m  stations in Japanese archipelago and aims phase referencing
and astrometry observations with a 2-beam system.  It makes simultaneous
observations of two objects with the 22-GHz and 43-GHz bands.

Speaker:        Mei-Yin Chou / Locutus Huang / Kevin Koay (ASIAA)
Topic:          EHT and black hole shadows in the news and popular culture
Time:           4/22 (Monday) 12:15 - 13:15
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Since the Event Horizon Telescope press release on April 10, the image of the black hole shadow has received a lot of public attention, thanks to the various broadcast, written, online and social media. We will share some of the interesting and light-hearted articles, memes and anecdotes that have appeared, demonstrating how this iconic image has impacted popular culture in just a little more than a week. We also delve into some of the darker and more unfortunate effects this public attention has had on people and science in general.

Speaker:        Martin Bureau (Oxford)
Topic:          WISDOM: Probing Supermassive Black Holes and their Immediate Environments with ALMA
Time:           4/24 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
I will present key results from the mm-Wave Interferometric Survey of
Dark Object Masses (WISDOM), a high resolution survey of molecular gas
in galaxy nuclei. First, I will show that CO can be used to easily and
accurately measure the mass of the supermassive black holes lurking at
galaxy centres. I will discuss substantial ongoing efforts to do this,
and present many spectacular new ALMA measurements, the latest of
which rival the best black hole measurements to date. This opens the
way to literally hundreds of measurements across the Hubble sequence
(in both active and non-active galaxies) with a unique method. Second,
I will briefly show how the same data allow to study the
spatially-resolved properties of the giant molecular clouds in all the
galaxies studied. This will yield cloud censuses in non-local galaxies
(including early-type galaxies) for the first time, providing a new
tool to understand and contrast the star formation efficiency across
galaxies. Already, it appears that basic cloud properties are not
universal and vary systematically along the Hubble sequence, contrary
to long-held assumptions.


*** Seminar ***

Speaker:        Etsuko Mieda (NAOJ)
Topic:          High resolution? Wide science field? AO projects at TMT and Subaru
Time:           4/25 (Thursday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
As telescopes become larger, the improvement and development of adaptive optics (AO) techniques become crucial to fully utilize their large aperture size. In this talk, I will briefly review the basics of AO, and then focus on two AO projects, NAFIRAOS at TMT and ULTIMATE at Subaru, as two opposite extreme spectrum of AO techniques. They both use multiple laser beams, but one is optimized to achieve highest spatial resolution in a narrow field whereas the other is optimized to achieve the largest science field with a moderate resolution.

Subject: Ph. D. position in astrochemistry and atmospheric chemistry at Stockholm University: Application deadline  in 4 days!
Date: Fri, 19 Apr 2019 09:27:16 +0000
Status: RO

Dear Colleagues,

Please forward the following announcement to possibly interested students:
Ph. D. position in astrochemistry and atmospheric chemistry at Stockholm
University - Application deadline in 4 days!

A 4-years position of a Ph. D. student in the field of astrochemistry and
molecular astrophysics is available at Stockholm University under the
supervision of Prof. Wolf D. Geppert. The work will focus on the
investigations of ion reactions in the interstellar medium and planetary
ionospheres trough experimental and theoretical methods. The focus will be on:

  * Identification of products of ion-ion reactions relevant for the
interstellar medium and planetary ionospheres using the novel and unique
DESIREE double storage ring in Stockholm
  * Studies of atmospheric and interstellar ion-neutral reactions of ions using
guided beams. In a collaboration composed of the Universities of Trento,
J. Heyrovsk' Institute (Prague), Universit Paris Saclay, and and SU we will
pursue the selective generation of specific isomers of ions and investigations
of their reactions with common molecules in Titan=92s atmosphere.
  * Spectroscopic studies of isomeric ions With the help the ion trap
experiment at the FELIX free electron laser at the University of Nijmegen
infrared spectra of isomeric cations will be measured in order to establish
selective production procedures of their isomers.
  * Furthermore, we envisage planning of rocket- and balloon-based missions to
assess the abundance, identity and distribution of cluster ions in Earth's
atmosphere and their possible role in aerosol formation. The experimental and
modelling studies to be carried out regarding ion clusters will identify the
build-up and destruction processes of ionospheric clusters, predict their
abundances and thus be of fundamental help in preparing a scientific case for
such missions.
  * The results of these investigations will be used as input data of model
calculations of dark interstellar clouds and planetary or satellite atmospheres
and for astronomic observations. The successful candidate will be offered
full-time employment with a competitive salary and full medical and social
security coverage. Also, the Stockholm University Astrobiology Centre has some
funds for travel.

Please check the following website for information about application
procedures and rules:

The position is advertised under the heading "PhD student in studies of
Isomeric Interstellar and Atmospheric Ions and their Reactions"
