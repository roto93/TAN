Topic:          A development of compact triple band receiver for millimeter-wave radio astronomy
Time:           1/22 (Tuesday) 11:00 - 12:00
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
We have developed a compact triple-band receiver which enables simultaneous observations in the three frequency intervals K(18â€“26 GHz) band, Q(35â€“50 GHz) band, and W(85â€“115 GHz) band. The quasi-optics design enables the triple-band receiver to fit into a single cryostat with some of the mirrors and dichroic filters outside the cryostat. The total receiver system is 600 mm(W) x 980 mm(L) x 370 mm(H) including the optical circuit. When compared with the present KVN optical bench of size 2600 mm x 2300 mm x 60 mm, the system is significantly more compact and is tailorable for use in telescopes with a small receiver cabin. The receiver performance and test observation results will be presented. We have shown that it is possible to design a quasi-optical circuit that has simultaneous observation capability for three or four frequency bands for millimeter and sub-millimeter receivers. Ultimately, this concept may lead to development of much more compact multi-frequency recei!
 ver systems for mm-wave and sub-mm radio telescopes.

Topic:          Black hole shadow and relativistic jet image in M87
Time:           1/23 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
he Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) is a very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) array aiming for imaging black hole (BH) shadows on event horizon scales, and exploring fundamental properties of BHs as well as physics of accretion flows/relativistic jets. M87 is one of the prime target of EHT, because the expected diameter of the black hole shadow is larger than the beam size of EHT. Theoretical studies of BH shadow and relevant disk-jet images are very important to estimate the mass and spin of black holes and to reveal the physics of accretion flow and launching mechanism of relativistic jets.  We have recently developed a new general relativistic radiative transfer (GRRT) code and have carried out calculations of the black hole shadow in M87, assuming a simple model of accretion flow or disk-jet model based on GRMHD simulations (Nakamura et al. 2018 and in prep.). Based on the simple accretion flow model, we have newly found that the BH spin can be constrained by measuring !
 the dark-crescent feature which appears in the rapidly spinng BHs. We also introduce our recent GRRT calculation results of disk-jet models based on GRMHD simulations from horizon to mili-arcsecond scale (i.e., one thousand gravitational radius scale). The resultant image shows the limb-brightened jet far from the black hole, that is consistent with the VLBI observation images.
