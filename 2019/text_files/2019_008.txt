Dear colleagues,

We would like to announce a two-day workshop on April 8-9, focusing
on massive stars, core-collapse supernovae, and nucleosynthesis. The
workshop will be held in the Institute of Physics, Academia Sinica.

The goal of this mini-workshop is to discuss recent developments and issues
related to massive stars, core-collapse supernovae, and the associated
nucleosynthesis of elements. They play the fundamental roles in the
evolution of early galaxies and serve as one of the primary target in the
era of multi-messenger astronomy, including electromagnetic, neutrino, and
gravitational wave emissions. As we hope that new ideas, directions, and
potential collaborations may be identified through the discussions during
the mini-workshop, we plan to have just roughly 6 talks within two days,
including three invited talks. Each talk can cover one specific topic for ~
50-60 minutes, plus in addition, 30-40 minutes time for rather informal but
in-depth discussions.

You are cordially invited to submit a registration and/or a talk through
the workshop website
https://nctsmma.github.io/events/201904-miniworkshop/index.html. The
registration deadline is March 7, 2019. If you have any inquiries and
questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.

Sincerely yours,

Ke-Jung Chen (Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Academia Sinica)
Kuo-Chuan Pan (Institute of Astronomy, National Tsing Hua University)
