Topic:         Astronomy on Tap
Time:         11/11 (Monday) 12:15 - 13:15
Place:          R1203
Abstract:
Astronomy on Tap (AoT) started in 2014 in New York City by Meg Schwamb with the goal of bringing astronomy research to the general public.  The events include a mix of talks, astronomy news updates, quizzes, and a chance for the audience to ask questions of professional astronomers.  We launched our monthly English Astronomy on Tap event in March 2019, and have also had two events in Chinese. These events have been a great way of connecting informally with members of the public who are interested in Astronomy.  Astronomy on Tap Taipei is organized by Sascha Zeegers, Rosemary Pike, Jonty Marshall, and Paula Granados and é…’å§è£¡çš„å¤©æ–‡å­¸ is organized by Wen-Ping Lo, and other PhD students.  We rely on ASIAA and visiting astronomers to volunteer to give short talks at our events, and the speakers can choose anything astronomy related for their talk.  We will discuss the Astronomy on Tap idea and give a shortened version of a typical AoT event.

Topic:         Gamma-ray line spectroscopy of cosmic nuclei: Supernova explosions and
ejecta flows
Time:         11/12 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:          R1203
Abstract:
Gamma ray lines from cosmic sources display the action of nuclear
reactions in cosmic sites. The gamma rays at such characteristic
energies result from nuclear transitions following radioactive decays or
high-energy collisions with excitation of nuclei. The gamma-ray line and
its associated special continuum from the annihilation of positrons at
511 keV falls into the same energy window, although of different origin.
We review the status of cosmic gamma ray spectrometry, reminding of the
corresponding instruments and missions and future perspectives. We then
present a discussion of recent results and the challenges and open
issues for the future. This includes, specifically, the diffuse
radioactive afterglow of massive-star nucleosynthesis in  26Al and  60Fe
gamma rays, which is now being exploited towards the cycle of matter
driven by massive stars and their supernovae, and towards understanding
the current Galaxy and structure and morphology of its interstellar
medium. Also the complex processes making stars explode as either
thermonuclear or core-collapse supernovae are subject to studies through
gamma-ray lines, in this case from shortlived radioactivities from 56Ni
and 44Ti decays. Herein the non-sphericities that have recently been
recognised as important are reflected, probably most-directly, through
gamma-ray line characteristics.  We will also discuss how we should
relate to the above the distribution of positron annihilation gamma ray
emission with its puzzling bulge-dominated intensity distribution, which
is measured through spatially-resolved spectra. These indicate that
annihilation conditions may differ in different parts of our Galaxy, and
helps to reveal the complex paths recycling matter from nucleosynthesis
sources to next-generation stars.

Topic:         The Landscape of Engine-Driven Explosions
Time:         11/12 (Tuesday) 12:15 - 13:15
Place:          R1203
Abstract:
In the conventional picture of a core-collapse supernova, the iron core collapses into a neutron star or a black hole, and a shockwave unbinds the star. In rare cases, accretion onto a rapidly rotating black hole acts as an "engine" that launches a jet. If that jet tunnels through the star, breaks out, and is pointed at the Earth, we detect a long-duration gamma-ray burst (GRB). There have been thousands of GRBs discovered, almost always by high-energy satellites. However, recent discoveries by optical surveys hint at diverse outcomes that are invisible to GRB satellites, such as jets that are choked inside the star. With the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) we are conducting a systematic exploration of the broader landscape of engine-driven explosions, of which traditional GRBs are just one manifestation. I will show how unexpected arrivals to the landscape (such as AT2018cow) complicate the picture, revealing that some engine-driven explosions take place in dense circumstel!
 lar material that was likely ejected in eruptive pre-explosion mass-loss episodes.

Topic:         CMB acoustic peak statistics and the excessive shift in the Planck data
Time:         11/13 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:          R1203
Abstract:
Measurement of the acoustic peaks of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature anisotropies has been instrumental in deciding the geometry and content of the universe. Acoustic peak positions vary in different parts of the sky due to statistical fluctuation. I will present the statistics of the peak positions of small patches from ESA Planck data. I found the one containing the mysterious "Cold Spot", an area near the Eridanus constellation where the temperature is significantly lower than Gaussian theory predicts, displays large synchronous shift of peak positions towards smaller multipole numbers with significance lower than one in 10000. For the combined anomalies of large synchronous shifts in acoustic peaks and lower than usual temperature at the Cold Spot area, we propose there is some extra localized unknown energy to stretch out the space in the transverse direction around the Cold Spot area. And in the follow-up investigation, we calculated the total shifts !
 of acoustic peak positions and construct a full-sky peak-shift map, from which we found strong global dipole signal compared with simulations. We discuss the possible origin of the dipole and some other features on the map.
