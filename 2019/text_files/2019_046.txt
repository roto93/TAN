Topic:          The fundamental plane of open clusters in the Milky Way
Time:           4/2 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
The fundamental plane (FP) is a scaling relation among effective radius, central velocity dispersion and average surface brightness of spherical dynamical systems, which is expected to be originated from the virial equilibrium of their members. Observations show that two kind of old and (relatively) isolated dynamical systems (age > 10 giga-year (Gyr)) both have FP: 1) elliptical galaxies (mass of ~10^12 solar masses), and 2) globular clusters (mass of 10^6 solar masses). Open clusters are the lower-mass counterparts of globular clusters, with masses are in the range of 100â€“104  solar masses. On the contrary to globular clusters, which are isolated in the remote halo of Milky Way without much perturbation, open clusters reside in the crowded plane of the Milky Way. They are subjected to strong tidal disturbance, such as disk shock, spiral arm passage, molecular cloud encounter, which increase the internal cluster energy, and consequently lead to their expansion and disrupt!
 ion. Many studies have suggested a typical survival timescale of 200 million-year (Myr) for open clusters and only 3% of the known open clusters have ages above 1 Gyr. Besides, the velocity dispersion of open clusters is at the order of 0.5-1 km/s, which requires spectroscopy of very high resolution. Therefore, their FP is not been studied or investigated in the past, due to the complexity of their dynamical evolution and the difficulty in obtaining precise velocity dispersion. We are motivated to extend the FP study to open clusters and quantify their dynamical status.  We select a sample of old open clusters (aged older than 1 Gyr) from the Milky Way open cluster catalog,  and make use of the data from the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment-2 in the fourteenth data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. For the first time, we establish a fundamental plane among cluster parameters, the line-of-sight velocity dispersion Ïƒ1D, Ks band luminosity LKs, an!
 d the half-light radius rh. The existence of this relation, wh!
 ich deviates significantly from the virial theorem prediction, implies that the dynamical structures of the old open clusters are quite similar, when survived from complex dynamical evolution to age older than 1 Gyr. Nbody simulation will be an approach to investigate the dynamical evolution of open clusters. In the end, most recent Nbody simulations of star clusters and discoveries of the nearby disrupted open clusters in the solar neighborhood will be mentioned briefly.

Topic:          The formation of close-in super-Earths through in-situ giant impacts
Time:           4/3 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Observations have found over 3000 exoplanets so far (exoplanets.org). These planets are located in close-in region of their central stars, typically within ~ 0.3 au. Most planets, especially members of multiple planet systems, are super-Earths whose main compositions are rock or ice (e.g., Batalha et al., 2013; Thompson et al. 2017). There are some scenarios of formation of close-in super-Earths systems (e.g., Raymond et al., 2014; Izidoro & Raymond 2018; Lambrechts et al. 2019). In all of these scenarios, most of the formed close-in super-Earths experience giant impacts. The planet growth via giant impacts at ~ 1 au around G dwarfs is intensively studied (e.g., Chambers & Wetherill 1998; Kokubo et al., 2006; Hansen 2009). It is expected that planet-planet scattering in close-in region becomes less effective than that at ~ 1au due to the strong central gravity. However, the dependences of the planet growth in the giant impact stage on the semimajor axis and central star mass!
  are not well understood yet. We investigate the growth of close-in super-Earths in the giant impact stage by N-body simulations. In close-in region, planets collide soon after their orbits are crossed due to small scattering cross-section. The eccentricities and inclinations of planets are kept small, i.e., the evolution in close-in region is dynamically cold. The distributions of eccentricities and inclinations of close-in super-Earths are well reproduced when the initial inclinations are small.
