¡ª¡ª¡ª¡ª¡ª¡ª¡ª¡ª
Rationale
¡ª¡ª¡ª¡ª¡ª¡ª¡ª¡ª
The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) successfully took a picture of M87's
black hole (BH) shadow surrounded by a ringlike emission, which is one
of the strongest confirmations of Einstein¡¯s general relativity and existence
of supermassive BHs at the centers of galaxies. The picture also
accelerates our investigations on the launching mechanism of relativistic
jets in active galactic nuclei. A puzzling/surprising fact is that M87¡¯s jet is
unseen in the EHT picture, although it is overwhelmingly bright at longer
wavelengths. The missing link between the BH shadow and the jet now
draws much attention as one of the most important remaining issues.
To address this issue, along with EHT, complementary VLBI observations
at long wavelengths (3mm/7mm/10mm), offered by such as the Global
Millimeter VLBI Array (GMVA), the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) and
the East Asian VLBI Network (EAVN) will play increasingly important roles\.

The main purpose of this workshop is to get better understanding on
BH-powered outflows in the universe. The M87 jet is a prototype in such
sources and the first M87 EHT results provide us with a lot of new
perspectives on it. Hence, the lineup of invited speakers in this workshop
are mostly linked to the first EHT M87 results, and the following topics will
be covered by those talks.

Dear all (with apologies for the cross-posting),

Please find the call for proposal of three Italian radio telescopes below\.

Best regards,

2020A CALL FOR PROPOSALS INAF - RADIO TELESCOPES


-- DEADLINE 3.10.2019 12:00 CET--


The Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica (INAF) invites scientists to
participate in the call for proposals of observing time at the three
national radio telescopes:

- the 32-m Medicina antenna
- the 32-m Noto antenna
- the 64-m Sardinia Radio Telescope

Two observing semesters are scheduled every year: 1st January to 30th June,
1st July to 31st December.
Deadlines fall in early October and early April, respectively.


The three telescopes can be used as single dishes for spectroscopic and
 continuum observations as well as for VLBI, outside the standard networks
coordination (EVN, IVS, etc.) which have their own time allocations.

VLBI proposers must take care of organising the availability of
international telescopes if needed by their observations. The presence of
observers at SRT is also requested. They are also required to contact the
antenna staff prior to submission, in order to assess the availability of
software/hardware services for their specific needs.

Some SRT configurations are offered in shared risk mode, please take this
into account when preparing the proposal and contact SRT team before
submitting the proposal.
SRT staff may be able to offer support for external proposer/observer, you
can contact them for details.

Instructions on the submission procedure and characteristics of the
instruments currently available can be found at

http://www.radiotelescopes.inaf.it/proposal_main.html


A dedicated help desk for the submission only may be reached via e-mail at
radioproposal@inaf.it

The proposals will be peer-reviewed and should be submitted before
12:00 CET of October 3rd, 2019.

Below we report the time INAF plans to award for the next semester 2020A:

Medicina: 2500 hours
Noto: 2000 hours
SRT: 1500 hours

These amounts might be subject to modification, due to maintenance needs
and to the variability of the commitments resulting from international
agreements.


** NOTICE

According to the MOU between INAF and KASI up to 30hrs of observing time in
VLBI mode are allocated to approved eating VLBI projects. These projects
have to be submitted both to the Italian and Korean TACs with the standard
form selecting "Eating VLBI mode" in the project type. Approved projects
will be observed up to 30hrs/semester.
Projects exceeding 30 hours will be scheduled together with all other
projects according to their relative grades.
PIs of these proposals must be associated with INAF or KASI.

**

Please, feel free to distribute the present call to anyone interested
Best regards,


Tiziana Venturi
Emilio Molinari

*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________
Speaker:    Peter Scicluna (ASIAA)
Topic:         Dusty mass-loss from evolved stars
Time:         9/18 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:          R1203
Abstract: Evolved Stars play key roles, enriching galaxies with dust, gas that fuels star
formation and the products of nucleosynthesis through their mass loss.For low- and
intermediate-mass stars, a large part of this mass loss occurs on the Asymptotic Giant
Branch through a dusty wind, while the more massive Red Supergiants undergo similar
processes. In this talk, I will review some recent progress in understanding the mechanisms
driving this mass loss and how it enriches the ISM. I will then present some results from the
ongoing JCMT large program the Nearby Evolved Stars Survey, which is observing a
statistical sample of evolved stars in the Solar Neighbourhood. NESS aims to determine the
total mass return to the Solar Neighbourhood and obtain a statistical picture of the physics
of mass loss. Finally, I will explore some important avenues for future work in this field.
