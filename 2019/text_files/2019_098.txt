Dear Yi-Jehng,

I would appreciate it if you could circulate this announcement to TAN.

Thank you.

-----------------

Dear Colleagues,

We are pleased to announce that the workshop Science with the =
Submillimeter Array: Present and Future is now open for registration. =
Please visit the workshop website =
https://events.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/workshop/20191104 =
<https://events.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/workshop/20191104> for more =
information. This workshop, to be held in ASIAA from November 4 - 5, is =
co-organized by Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics =
(ASIAA) and the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian.=20

In coordination with the Eastern Asian Observatory, the SMA Science =
Workshop and the JCMT annual Users Meeting will be held back to back =
during the week of November 4. This presents opportunities for =
interested parties to attend both meetings. Please visit =
www.eaobservatory.org/jcmt/science/um-asiaa-2019/ =
<http://www.eaobservatory.org/jcmt/science/um-asiaa-2019/> for more =
information on the JCMT meeting.

We look forward to seeing you in Taipei.

With best regards,

Qizhou Zhang and Patrick Koch on behalf of SOC


First Announcement
Science with the Submillimeter Array: Present and Future
November 4 - 5, 2019, ASIAA, Taipei

The Submillimeter Array (SMA) pioneered submillimeter imaging =
interferometry from its excellent site near the summit of Maunkea more =
than 15 years ago and continues to offer forefront capabilities today. =
The modest scale of the SMA enables rapid adoption of new technologies =
and prompt response to new scientific opportunities. Since the =
deployment of the SWARM correlator in 2017, SMA users have had access to =
a unique combination of wide bandwidth (32 GHz) and uniform high =
spectral resolution (140 kHz) to address numerous and diverse =
astrophysical problems. The diagnostic power of millimeter/submillimeter =
continuum and spectral line emission, polarization properties, and time =
variability are applied to targets ranging from Solar System bodies to =
galaxies at cosmological distances. The phased SMA also provides a key =
station in the Event Horizon Telescope, a global effort to image black =
holes and associated strong gravity effects.

The ongoing wSMA upgrade will deliver even more bandwidth (128 GHz) to =
realize further gains in sensitivity and speed, as well as =
infrastructure to support future innovative instrumentation. Hence it is =
timely for the SMA community to get together to review the current =
status of the SMA, share recent results, discuss synergies with other =
observatories, and foster new collaborations. In particular, this =
meeting will highlight how the SMA provides a powerful and flexible =
complement to the international ALMA, the EAO-operated JCMT single dish =
telescope, and other major observatories on the ground and in space.=20
