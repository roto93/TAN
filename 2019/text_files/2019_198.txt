Topic:         Recent Advancements in Core-collapse Supernova Observation Through the Global Supernova Project
Time:         1/8 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:          R1203
Abstract:
upernovae are among the most influential events in every astrophysical scale. New wide-field and high-cadence transient surveys enable us to watch supernovae from the moment of explosion. Paired with rapid and continuous monitoring facilities, these observations reveal unprecedented features that bridge our understanding of their progenitor systems to explosion mechanisms. From the discovery to follow-up, the Global Supernova Project is a world-wide collaboration of +150 supernova observers and theorists facilitated with the Las Cumbres Observatory and various other ground and space telescopes. In this talk, I will highlight the recent advancements in core-collapse supernova observation, especially in the context of the Global Supernova Project.
