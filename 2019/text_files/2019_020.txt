Topic:          Galactic Archaeology: a unique probe of the nature of dark matter
Time:           2/25 (Monday) 11:00 - 12:00
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Dark matter is now known to be the vital ingredient for the growth of structure in the Universe, while its nature remains a mystery.
Galaxies in the Local Group are excellent laboratories to shed light on the nature of dark matter and its role in the galaxy formation.
This is because these galaxies are sufficiently close to measure photometry, spectroscopy, and astrometry for their resolved stars, and this information enables us to study their chemo-dynamical structures in detail. Such studies are so-called "Galactic Archaeology".
In particular, dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies are ideal sites for studying the basic properties of dark matter as they are largely dark-matter dominated.
Revealing dark matter distributions in dSphs is of crucial importance in testing dark matter models and constraining particle candidate of dark matter.
In this talk, I will discuss dark halo structures in the dSphs through our dynamical analysis of their current available data.
I will also discuss how dynamical studies for the dSphs can place constraints on the nature of dark matter.
I will also present the future prospects for Galactic Archaeology science with deep and wide-field photometric and spectroscopic surveys, especially Subaru-HSC and PFS.

Topic:          Axion Dark Matter Search with Optical Cavity Experiment
Time:           2/26 (Tuesday) 11:00 - 12:00
Place:           R812
Abstract:
The outline of this talk is mainly based on our recent paper 10.1103/PhysRevLett.121.161301. In this talk, I will present a novel experimental approach to search for axion dark matter which does not need a conventional strong magnetic field but use an optical cavity. This new method aims to measure the difference of phase velocity between two circular-polarized photons which is caused by the coupling to axion dark matter. The experimental sensitivity is in principle only limited by quantum noise which enables us to probe tiny axion-photon coupling  g_{aÎ³} <~ 10^{âˆ’11}GeV^{-1} with axion mass range m_a <~ 10^{-10}eV, which is competitive with other experimental proposals.  If I have time, I will also discuss the possibility to test axion dark matter with ongoing and upcoming gravitational wave detectors by using a scheme similar to our proposed method.



*** Colloquium ***

Speaker:        Takafumi Ootsubo (JAXA)
Topic:          Comets, asteroids, and interplanetary dust observed with 
infrared satellites: from AKARI to SPICA
Time:           2/27 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
AKARI, the Japanese infrared astronomical satellite, was launched 
in February 2006 and made a number of pointed observations for 
deep imaging and spectroscopy together with the all-sky survey. 
The data of the AKARI observations are essential not only for 
the studies of the Galactic and extragalactic sciences, but also 
for the Solar System sciences on comets, asteroids, TNOs, and 
interplanetary dust. AKARI has already provided many precious 
survey data sets and outcomes for the Solar System sciences, 
including the asteroid catalog and the zodiacal emission map.

AKARI has a spectroscopic capability in near- and mid-infrared 
wavelength region. We carried out spectroscopic observations 
for tens of asteroids and comets in 2.5-5 micron. AKARI detects 
clear absorption/emission features related to hydrated minerals 
in many asteroids and carbon dioxide in cometary comae. 
AKARI also made the spectroscopy of the zodiacal emission in 
the mid-infrared (5.5 to 12.5 micron) and detected the silicate 
feature around 10-micron region toward the various ecliptic 
latitude regions. These data sets provide us the information 
on the physicochemical environment in the early solar nebula. 

SPICA (Space Infrared Telescope for Cosmology and Astrophysics) 
is an ESA-JAXA joint mission for infrared astrophysics after 
AKARI, Spitzer and Herschel. SPICA covers infrared wavelength 
(12 to 230 micron) region spectroscopically with the scientific 
instruments SMI and SAFARI. In this talk, I will summarize the 
successful results of AKARI and introduce the SPICA science 
goals on the Solar System sciences.
