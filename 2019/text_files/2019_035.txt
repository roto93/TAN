Title: Combining theory and observations of trans-Neptunian objects to pin
down Neptune=E2=80=99s
                  migration history

Abstract:

The current orbital structure of the trans-Neptunian region holds the key
to understanding how the giant planets migrated to their present-day
orbits. In particular, the population of trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs)
captured into orbital resonance with Neptune during migration are capable
of recording properties of that migration. There are, however, challenges
in observationally constraining the current distribution of resonant TNOs,
determining which resonant TNOs were likely captured during migration, and
in generalizing theoretical studies and numerical simulations of resonant
capture during migration. I will discuss some of my recent and ongoing
investigations into these challenges. I will discuss recent modeling of the
transient resonant TNO populations and how this can inform the
interpretation of observationally derived resonant TNO population models. I
will also present the results of investigations into how Neptune=E2=80=99s
migration characteristics affect the distributions of primordially captured
TNOs in the 3:2 and 2:1 resonance; some of these results offer
counterpoints to recent investigations in the literature, highlighting the
difficulty of uniquely constraining Neptune=E2=80=99s migration based on nu=
merical
investigations. I will end by discussing current and future observational
investigations that will help guide further theoretical work.
