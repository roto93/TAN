Dear all,

TTTT seminar at NTHU is scheduled on 1st April given
by Chen-Fatt in NTU/ASIAA.

Title:
SCUBA-2 Ultra Deep Imaging EAO Survey (STUDIES):
Multi-wavelength properties and luminosity function of
450 Î¼m selected galaxies

Speaker: Chen-Fatt Lim (NTU/ASIAA)
Time: 12:20-13:00pm 1st April (Monday)
Venue: R501, IoA, 5th floor in the 2nd General Building

Abstract:
The majority of star formation in the Universe is obscured
by dust and produces strong infrared and sub-millimeter
radiation. Far-infrared or sub-millimeter observations are
therefore required to fully understand the formation history
of galaxies. In this talk, I will present the recent progress and
results of the SCUBA-2 Ultra Deep Imaging EAO Survey (STUDIES)
project. STUDIES is a JCMT Large Project aiming at obtaining
confusion limited 450 Î¼m images in the COSMOS and SXDS
regions, to detect the majority of the dusty galaxy population.
So far, ~ 60% of the total allocated integration of the COSMOS
field has been obtained. This leads to by far the deepest 450 Î¼m
image with an area of ~300 arcmin2 and a noise level of ~ 0.65
mJy in the map center. We conducted SED fitting on sources with
multi-wavelength counterparts to estimate their physical
properties, including photometric redshifts, infrared luminosities,
star formation rates, dust temperatures, stellar masses, and dust
attenuations. Because of the unprecedented depth of the
STUDIES image, these analyses reached ~ 30 Mâ¦¿ yr-1 galaxies
at z ~ 2. Our data provide new measurements of obscured SFR
densities at z =0-4, without any assumptions in the faint-end
slopes of the infrared luminosity function. We are also building a
450 Î¼m-based machine-learning algorithm to identify the SMG
candidates in the entire 1.77 deg2 COSMOS region. There will be
roughly 7500 such machine-learning candidates and they will be
used for clustering analyses and halo mass estimations for faint
SMGs. All the above will advance our understanding of the typical
members in the high-redshift dusty galaxy population.

Best regards,
Tetsuya Hashimoto
