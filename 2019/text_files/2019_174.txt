Dear all,

TTTT seminar at IoA/NTHU is scheduled on 5th Nov given by
Prof. Hyunjin Shim (Kyungpook National University). Anyone is
welcomed to join.

Title:
Star-forming galaxies of different cosmic epochs

Speaker: Prof. Hyunjin Shim (Kyungpook National University)
Time: 10:00am 5th Nov. 2019 (Tuesday)
Venue: R501, IoA, 5th floor in the 2nd General Building

Abstract:
Star formation is one of the main baryonic process to derive
the galaxy build-up. Observational probes of star formation in
different wavelengths provides a way to investigate star-forming
galaxies at various epoch that would lead us to understanding of
cosmic history of galaxy evolution. I will introduce two major
probes of star formation, emission line and rest-frame infrared
emission, and discuss the properties of selected galaxies at low
and high redshift.

Best regards,
