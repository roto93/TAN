Title: Can the black hole war be ended?
Abstract:
The question of whether Hawking evaporation violates unitarity, and
therefore results in the loss of information, has remained unresolved since
Hawking's seminal discovery. To date, the debates have remained mostly
theoretical since it is almost impossible to settle this paradox through
direct astrophysical black hole observations. Is there any hope to see the
end of such a =E2=80=9Cblack hole war=E2=80=9D?  In this talk we will first=
 review, in a
very pedagogical way, the origin and the history of the black hole war.  We
then point out that accelerating relativistic flying plasma mirrors can
serve as analog black holes that mimic the late stage of black hole
evaporation. Such an accelerating plasma mirror can be prepared by injectin=
g
an intense x-ray pulse into a nano thin film with a graded density.  This
can in principle be accomplished via state-of-the-art laser and
nano-fabrication technologies. A conception of such an experiment is
proposed and a self-consistent set of physical parameters is presented.
Critical issues, such as how the black hole unitarity may be preserved, can
be addressed through the entanglement between the analog Hawking radiation
photons and their partner modes.
