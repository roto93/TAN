<http://hpc.imit.chiba-u.jp/eanam9/index.html>

Aims and Scope:
Numerical simulations have become even more important as detailed =
comparisons between theories and observations are now possible at a =
deeper level in most fields of astrophysics. The aim of this series of =
meetings is to bring (but not limited to) East-Asian numerical =
astrophysicists together and provide chances to learn each other's work =
and explore possible collaborations among them. The scope of the meeting =
will encompass all major astronomical research fields that involve =
numerical simulations, including (but not limited to) cosmology, =
astronomical hydrodynamics, magnetohydrodynamics, radiative transfer, =
particle acceleration, and planetary/stellar/galactic dynamics. In =
addition, there will also be a focus on computer science applications =
directed toward astrophysics including numerical methods, simulation =
data analysis, high performance computing, and optimization for use on =
large scale computer clusters. Participants from outside of the East =
Asia are warmly welcomed as w
ell.

Topic:         Astronomy on Tap
Time:         11/11 (Monday) 12:15 - 13:15
Place:          R1203
Abstract:
Astronomy on Tap (AoT) started in 2014 in New York City by Meg Schwamb with the goal of bringing astronomy research to the general public.  The events include a mix of talks, astronomy news updates, quizzes, and a chance for the audience to ask questions of professional astronomers.  We launched our monthly English Astronomy on Tap event in March 2019, and have also had two events in Chinese. These events have been a great way of connecting informally with members of the public who are interested in Astronomy.  Astronomy on Tap Taipei is organized by Sascha Zeegers, Rosemary Pike, Jonty Marshall, and Paula Granados and é…’å§è£¡çš„å¤©æ–‡å­¸ is organized by Wen-Ping Lo, and other PhD students.  We rely on ASIAA and visiting astronomers to volunteer to give short talks at our events, and the speakers can choose anything astronomy related for their talk.  We will discuss the Astronomy on Tap idea and give a shortened version of a typical AoT event.

Speaker:    Roland Diehl (MPE)
Topic:         Gamma-ray line spectroscopy of cosmic nuclei: Supernova explosions and
ejecta flows
Time:         11/12 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:          R1203
Abstract:
Gamma ray lines from cosmic sources display the action of nuclear
reactions in cosmic sites. The gamma rays at such characteristic
energies result from nuclear transitions following radioactive decays or
high-energy collisions with excitation of nuclei. The gamma-ray line and
its associated special continuum from the annihilation of positrons at
511 keV falls into the same energy window, although of different origin.
We review the status of cosmic gamma ray spectrometry, reminding of the
corresponding instruments and missions and future perspectives. We then
present a discussion of recent results and the challenges and open
issues for the future. This includes, specifically, the diffuse
radioactive afterglow of massive-star nucleosynthesis in  26Al and  60Fe
gamma rays, which is now being exploited towards the cycle of matter
driven by massive stars and their supernovae, and towards understanding
the current Galaxy and structure and morphology of its interstellar
medium. Also the complex processes making stars explode as either
thermonuclear or core-collapse supernovae are subject to studies through
gamma-ray lines, in this case from shortlived radioactivities from 56Ni
and 44Ti decays. Herein the non-sphericities that have recently been
recognised as important are reflected, probably most-directly, through
gamma-ray line characteristics.  We will also discuss how we should
relate to the above the distribution of positron annihilation gamma ray
emission with its puzzling bulge-dominated intensity distribution, which
is measured through spatially-resolved spectra. These indicate that
annihilation conditions may differ in different parts of our Galaxy, and
helps to reveal the complex paths recycling matter from nucleosynthesis
sources to next-generation stars.

Topic:         The Landscape of Engine-Driven Explosions
Time:         11/12 (Tuesday) 12:15 - 13:15
Place:          R1203
Abstract:
In the conventional picture of a core-collapse supernova, the iron core collapses into a neutron star or a black hole, and a shockwave unbinds the star. In rare cases, accretion onto a rapidly rotating black hole acts as an "engine" that launches a jet. If that jet tunnels through the star, breaks out, and is pointed at the Earth, we detect a long-duration gamma-ray burst (GRB). There have been thousands of GRBs discovered, almost always by high-energy satellites. However, recent discoveries by optical surveys hint at diverse outcomes that are invisible to GRB satellites, such as jets that are choked inside the star. With the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) we are conducting a systematic exploration of the broader landscape of engine-driven explosions, of which traditional GRBs are just one manifestation. I will show how unexpected arrivals to the landscape (such as AT2018cow) complicate the picture, revealing that some engine-driven explosions take place in dense circumstel!
 lar material that was likely ejected in eruptive pre-explosion mass-loss episodes.

Topic:         CMB acoustic peak statistics and the excessive shift in the Planck data
Time:         11/13 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:          R1203
Abstract:
Measurement of the acoustic peaks of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature anisotropies has been instrumental in deciding the geometry and content of the universe. Acoustic peak positions vary in different parts of the sky due to statistical fluctuation. I will present the statistics of the peak positions of small patches from ESA Planck data. I found the one containing the mysterious "Cold Spot", an area near the Eridanus constellation where the temperature is significantly lower than Gaussian theory predicts, displays large synchronous shift of peak positions towards smaller multipole numbers with significance lower than one in 10000. For the combined anomalies of large synchronous shifts in acoustic peaks and lower than usual temperature at the Cold Spot area, we propose there is some extra localized unknown energy to stretch out the space in the transverse direction around the Cold Spot area. And in the follow-up investigation, we calculated the total shifts !
 of acoustic peak positions and construct a full-sky peak-shift map, from which we found strong global dipole signal compared with simulations. We discuss the possible origin of the dipole and some other features on the map.

Subject: [REMINDER] [KaVA/EAVN2020A] Call for Proposals for EAVN for the 2020A semester
Date: Fri, 8 Nov 2019 01:26:07 +0000

Dear colleagues,

This is a reminder that the proposal submission deadline for the East
Asian VLBI Network (EAVN) is approaching to November 15, 8:00 UT.

*********
Please visit the following website for EAVN proposal submission since
there is an additional notification (special condition of time allocation
for Nobeyama 45-m telescope) to EAVN proposers appeared on October 31.

https://radio.kasi.re.kr/kava/proposal_info.php
*********

Please refer also to the following EAVN website for more details about
the array.

(KASI; in place of EAVN directors)


---------------------------------------------------

***************************************************
Call for Proposals for the East Asian VLBI Network (EAVN)
for the 2020A semester
Proposal submission deadline: 15th November, 2019, 8:00 UT
***************************************************

*** Overview ***
We invite proposals for open-use observations with the East Asian VLBI
Network (EAVN), which is the international collaborative VLBI array
between China, Korea, and Japan. In the 2020A semester, 11 telescopes
(VERA 4 x 20 m, KVN 3 x 21 m, Nobeyama 45 m, Takahagi 32 m, Tianma 65 m,
and Nanshan 26 m) participate in the EAVN open-use program. From the
2020A semester, proposal submission of the KVN and VERA Array (KaVA;
7-telescope array with KVN and VERA) is integrated with that of EAVN.


*** Observing mode ***
EAVN provides an opportunity of VLBI observations with a data recording
rate of 1 Gbps (total bandwidth of 256 MHz and with single polarization
(LHCP) at 22 and 43 GHz. We also support various observing modes such
as 'astrometry mode' and 'hybrid mode' for part of EAVN telescopes.
Please refer to the EAVN status report on the EAVN website for more
details.


*** Telescope time ***
The total available observation time for EAVN is up to 500 hours in
the 2020A semester, while the available observing time for each EAVN
telescope is different. All EAVN observations will be scheduled between
11th January and 10th June 2020. Please refer to the EAVN status report
on the EAVN website for more details.

EAVN accepts a request of usage of sub-array configuration (KaVA 7
telescopes and additional telescopes from non-KaVA stations), as well
as EAVN full array configuration.

The maximum observation time for a single EAVN proposal is limited to
150 hours in case of usage of only KaVA, while one can request for the
maximum total observation time of 60 hours for Tianma and Nanshan for
a single proposal, and that of 24 hours for Nobeyama and Takahagi. If
requested, the observation time can be allocated over a year until 10th
January 2021, however the total observation time is still limited to
150 hours even in this case.


*** Target of opportunity ***
EAVN accepts target of opportunity (ToO) proposals, while Nobeyama and
Takahagi cannot be included for ToO proposals. It is strongly recommended
that ToO proposals (especially expected ToO) are submitted during the
regular CfP. Unexpected or urgent ToO can be submitted as Director's
Discretionary Time (DDT) proposals at any time. ToO proposals must
include clear triggering criteria to initiate an observation. ToOs
are valid for one year after it is approved. ToO proposals for DDT
should follow the same format of regular call and should be sent to
eavnprop(at mark)kasi.re.kr.


*** Proposal submission ***
Proposals should be submitted via EAVN website. Proposal submission
deadline is 15th November 2019, 8:00 UT. Please refer to the EAVN
status report for detailed information about the proposal format. The
designated coversheet form can be downloaded via the EAVN websites.


*** EAVN website ***
Please refer to the following EAVN website for more information about
the array capabilities and detailed conditions for proposal submission.
