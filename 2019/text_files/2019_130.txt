Dear colleagues,

There will be  JCMT Transient Survey workshop next week at NCU, in Room
1013 of the Astronomy Institute.  The program aims to detect and
characterize episodic brightening events associated with circumstellar
accretion, or chromospheric magnetic reconnection.  A total of eight nearby
star-forming regions are being monitored in submillimeter wavelengths,
about once per month for the last three years, affording first ever such
time series studies, and upon stacking, the deepest stacking images.

A few survey team members will give talks that may be of interest to you.
In addition, a few local experts on YSO variability in general will add
diversity to the discussions.

The tentative agenda follows.  Those marked with asterisks,on Tuesday
morning August 20, are likely attractive to an audience at large, whereas
some other presentations may be technical. You are cordially invited to
any, or all, of the sessions.

Cheers,
Wen Ping
