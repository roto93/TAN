Title: Five years after the ALMA Long Baseline Campaign: What we have
learned about star and planet formation in HL Tau

Abstract:
With unprecedented resolution and sensitivity of Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), tens of protoplanetary disks are
found to have fine structures, such as rings and gaps. The protoplanetary
disk around HL Tau is one of the youngest disks showing the fine
structures, and it is considered as a promising candidate site of planet
formation. Over the past five years, we had follow-up studies of HL Tau
with IRAM 30m, JCMT, SMA, and ALMA. In this presentation, I will introduce
gas kinematics from 0.1 pc to 10 au scales around HL Tau revealed by our
observations. On the large scale, we find signs of outflow feedback from a
nearby star on the ambient gas around HL Tau, which could affect the mass
accretion in HL Tau. On the small scale, we find a gas stream flowing onto
the protoplanetary disk around HL Tau as well as a gas gap in the disk. I
will discuss the gaseous disk structures and the gas stream in HL Tau in
the context of planet formation and the implication of the outflow feedback
in HL Tau on the star formation process.

Title:  The z=3D10^-14 Universe: What Can the Dark Energy Survey Teach Us
About Our Own Solar System?
Abstract: The Dark Energy Survey (DES) is an optical survey targeting
nearly 5000 square degrees of the southern sky to probe the dynamics of the
expanding Universe. The combination of the survey area and depth not only
makes DES a powerful tool for precision cosmology but also well suited to
study the very local Universe: our own solar system. Indeed, DES has
detected more than two hundreds of TNOs =E2=80=94 the distant minor planets=
 in the
trans-Neptunian solar system. In this talk, I will overview the works of
our group, including the discovery of an extreme TNO, 2015 BP519 and the
study of first ever ultra-red colored Neptune Trojan. 2015 BP519 has a
semimajor axis a ~ 450 au, eccentricity e ~ 0.92, and inclination i ~ 54
degrees, makes it one of the most extreme minor planets in our solar
system. The existence of BP519 is difficult to explain, however, a
consequence of hypothetical Planet 9. Unlike the outer planet Trojan
asteroids, the Neptune Trojan 2013 VX30 is ultra-red, and such kind of
color only exist in TNO populations. Therefore, it could be a missing link
between outer planet Trojans and TNO populations.

Dear all,

This is the 2nd announcement of the international conference,
'Future Science with Multi-Wavelength Data:
North Ecliptic Pole Meeting 2019'
during 24-26 June at National Tsing Hua University in Taiwan.
Homepage
https://seongini.wixsite.com/nepconf2

We have four announcements.

1. Conference T-shirt (by 30 April)
We prepare free conference T-shirts for participants who registered
before 30 April. Please register earlier if you want to get it free.
The T-shirt design is on the conference homepage.

2. Registration and abstract submission (by 31 May)
The conference will cover diversity of galaxy researches including
local/high-z galaxies, IR galaxies, AGN, and cosmic star-formation
history. We also welcome any sciences based on multi-wavelength data,
not limited to AKARI.
The deadline of registration and abstract submission is 31 May.
Please create your account and login to register.

3. Hotel information
Hotel information is updated on the homepage.
We selected three recommended hotels around the venue.
Please make your hotel reservation early.

4. Excursion
A short trip to beautiful Beipu is scheduled on the last date, 26 June.
Beipu is an old town famous for 'cold spring'. As you know
Taiwan is extremely hot in summer. Please prepare your-own swimming
wear to jump into the cold spring.

Best regards,
Seong Jin Kim on behalf of LOC at NTHU

Topic:          Star Formation: Column Density PDFs as an Indirect Tracer of
Magnetic fields in Molecular Clouds
Time:           4/29 (Monday) 12:15 - 13:15
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Simulations generally show that non-self-gravitating clouds have a lognormal column density
probability distribution function (PDF), while self-gravitating clouds with active star formation
develop a distinct power-law tail at high column density. The transition point in the column
density PDF between the lognormal and the power-law portion defines the boundary beyond
which the self-gravity becomes dynamically important. In this talk, I will discuss the effect of
strong magnetic fields and turbulence on the evolution of the column density PDFs. I have used
three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations with non-ideal effects to study
different initial conditions and the way they affect the shape of the PDF. Our results are
interesting, including a distinct signature on how a combination of strong magnetic fields and
turbulence influence the power-law slope and the transitional column density between the
lognormal and the power-law portion of the column density PDFs.

Title:  Multimessenger Signals from Core-Collapse Supernovae
Abstract: Core-collapse supernovae, which came from stellar explosions of
very massive stars at the end of their lifetime, are expected to be a
significant science target of gravitational wave detectors and high energy
MeV neutrino detectors. In addition to observations of its electromagnetism
emissions, combing observation data with its gravitational wave or neutrino
signals enables us to comprehensively explore the underlying physics from a
single source associated with different physical processes. In this talk, I
would like to highlight the recent theoretical developments of
core-collapse supernovae as multimessenger sources.
