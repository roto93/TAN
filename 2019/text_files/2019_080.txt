*** NCU Colloquium ***

*Speaker*:    Dr Hsi-Yu Schive (NTU)
*Date/Time*:   May 24 (F), 14:00
*Room*:   NCU, S4 Room 1013
*Title*:     Wave Dark Matter Predictions from GPU-accelerated Adaptive Mes=
h
*Abstrac*t:    The conventional particle interpretation of cold dark matter
(CDM) still lacks laboratory support and struggles to explain the basic
properties of low-mass galaxies. This tension motivates wave dark matter (=
=CF=88DM)
composed of extremely light particles (m=CF=88~10-22 eV), which suppresses
structure below the kpc scale by the uncertainty principle but retains the
large-scale structure predicted by CDM. In the first part of this talk, I
will present cosmological =CF=88DM simulations with extremely high resoluti=
on
capable of resolving dwarf galaxies, revealing that every =CF=88DM halo has=
 a
prominent soliton core surrounded by fluctuating density granules. These
predictions are consistent with the observations of galaxy formation,
Lyman-alpha forest, reionization, and gravitational lensing flux anomalies.
I will also discuss several critical challenges faced by this model. The
second part of this talk will focus on GAMER, a GPU-accelerated adaptive
mesh refinement (AMR) code developed from scratch by our group. A rich set
of physics modules have been incorporated and which outperforms other AMR
codes by one to two orders of magnitude. The code scales well to thousands
of GPUs and achieves a uniform resolution as high as 10,2403 cells. I will
present several ongoing astrophysical projects using GAMER that require
substantially higher resolution than previously feasible.
