Arizona Radio Observatory: Call for Proposals (2019A)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Astrophysicists and Astronomers of Taiwan,

The Arizona Radio Observatory (ARO) solicits observing proposals for the ALMA Prototype 12-meter Telescope (12m) located on Kitt Peak, Arizona, and for the 10-meter Submillimeter Telescope (SMT) located on Mount Graham, Arizona, for the period February 15, 2019 - June 15, 2019. Proposal candidates from members of the University Consortium of ALMA-Taiwan (UCAT) and ASIAA should submit up to THREE pages of scientific and technical justification (including figures, tables, and references) in addition to their Proposal Summary Sheet (download form here):
https://www.as.arizona.edu/sites/default/files/ARO_Proposal_Cover_Sheet.pdf

All proposal candidates are required to list on the Proposal Summary Sheet their requested observing blocks (the exact LST ranges to be scheduled and number of times to be repeated), dates on which they are NOT available to observe, and dates in which sources in those observing blocks are within the Sun-avoidance zone (45 degrees at the SMT, 10 degrees at the 12m).

The 12m ALMA Prototype antenna currently supports an ALMA Band 3 (82.5-116 GHz) dual-polarization SBS (sideband-separating) receiver.  The 12m control system supports dual-polarization in the same sideband or single-polarization in each sideband ("2 IF mode"), position-switched, beam-switched, and OTF observations.  The new AROWS spectrometer is the recommended backend for 12m observations.  The MAC is available as a backup; the Filterbanks are being decommissioned during the 2019A semester. Possible backend modes may be found on the ARO Equipment Summary and Status sheet at: https://www.as.arizona.edu/arizona-radio-observatory 

The 10m SMT currently supports a dual-polarization ALMA Band 6 (211-280 GHz) receiver with SBS mixers.  Higher frequency receivers will not be available this semester.  The SMT control system supports both dual-polarization ("2 IF mode") and dual-polarization+dual-sideband observations ("4 IF mode") with tunable IF from 4.5-7.5 GHz, for position-switched, beam-switched, and OTF observations.  Proposal candidates should consult the ARO Equipment Summary and Status sheet for additional technical specifications at https://www.as.arizona.edu/arizona-radio-observatory . 

Remote observing is available. Observers who plan to observe remotely must supply fixed IP address(es) of the computer(s) that will be used during observing on their Proposal Summary Sheet. For further information about remote observing and other operational questions, please contact Tom Folkers, ARO Software Engineer: tfolkers@email.arizona.edu .

Scheduling of successful proposals will be done according to availability of the receivers requested.  Graduate student participation is especially encouraged. Proposals should be emailed in PDF format to kuan[at]asiaa.sinica.edu.tw by midnight (23:59 CST) January 21, 2019 (Monday).

Announcement of 3mm VLBI in Cycle 7
Jan 07, 2019

It is expected that phased ALMA will participate in some GMVA observations during ALMA Cycle 7 (Oct 2019 - Sept 2020;  see the ALMA Cycle 7 Pre-announcement).   There are likely to be ~43 ALMA antennas available to the ALMA observation; but the phased sum used for VLBI may be constructed only from those that lie within a circle of radius 0.5 km.   GMVA session dates for 2020 are not yet fixed but Session I in 2020, which is traditionally in the period March - May, would provide an opportunity for  GMVA + ALMA observing. 

Any GMVA proposal requesting phased ALMA during Cycle 7 must be submitted via the NRAO PST at the February 1, 2019 deadline.

Proposers should:

        â€¢ specify "ALMA" in the Other Stations text field in the PST
        â€¢ select the default GMVA 3mm observing mode of 2 Gbps, dual polarization
        â€¢ specify the amount of time and GST range(s) needed for ALMA separately, either in Session Constraints or Comments, or in the Technical Justification.

Topic:          Planetesimal Formation through the Streaming Instability
Time:           1/15 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
The formation of kilometer-scale planetesimals is one of the most difficult stages in the course of planet formation around young stars.  It is faced with several major barriers.  Direct dust growth by coagulation is limited, up to mm to cm in size, due to inefficient sticking, bouncing, and fragmentation at collision.  Even if the dust grains manage to grow past cm in size, they continually lose angular momentum to their surrounding gas due to constant head wind, leading to rapid orbital decay to the star.  One promising mechanism for circumventing these barriers is the streaming instability, in which the solids actively participate in the dust-gas dynamics to concentrate themselves to high density, leading to direct gravitational collapse and the formation of planetesimals.
>
I will review our current understanding of the streaming instability and planetesimal formation.  Specifically, how the instability operates, under what conditions it drives strong concentration of solid materials, the initial mass function of the resulting planetesimals, and its interaction with turbulent gas will be examined.

Topic:          Probing grain growth in protoplanetary disks via millimeter-wave polarization
Time:           1/16 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Dust coagulation in protoplanetary disks is the first step of planetesimal formation. However, a pathway from dust aggregates to planetesimals remains unclear. Both laboratory and numerical studies have so far shown that the structure of a dust aggregate plays important roles in planetesimal formation. However, the aggregate structure has been poorly constrained by disk observations. Recently, ALMA opens a new window to observe (sub-)millimeter-wave polarization of disks, which is expected to provide additional constraints on dust aggregate properties. In this study, we perform 3D radiative transfer simulations in order to study how the structure of dust aggregates affect millimeter-wave polarization from disks. As a result, it is found that relatively compact particles are favorable to explain observed millimeter-wave scattering polarization of disks, whereas highly porous and fractal particles fail to explain the observations. Furthermore, it is also shown that observed mi!
 llimeter-wave scattering polarization is consistent with grain radii of a few hundreds of microns, which are an order of magnitude smaller than that previously estimated. We discuss a possibility that these relatively small grains are due to efficient fragmentation of CO2-ice coated grains in disks.

Topic:          Faraday Rotation in the Jet of M87 Inside the Bondi Radius: Indication of Winds from Hot Accretion Flows Confining the Relativistic Jet
Time:           1/17 (Thursday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) often produce highly collimated relativistic jets, one of the most energetic phenomena in the Universe. Theoretical models predict that AGN jets can be accelerated to nearly speed-of-light by magnetic fields if they are confined by an external medium. Winds, nonrelativistic un-collimated gas outflows launched from accretion flows onto the supermassive black holes in AGNs, are primary candidates for this medium. Recent observations have indeed revealed gradual collimation and acceleration of the jet in M87, a nearby AGN that possesses a black hole with a mass of three to six billion Suns which provides a unique opportunity to investigate the region under the influence of the black hole's gravity. However, it has not been possible to either probe the external medium by observations or verify the general picture of jet collimation and acceleration. Here we report radio observations of Faraday rotation (the rotation of the plane of polarization by i!
 ntervening magnetic fields) in the M87 jet, where information on the external medium (which is not directly observable) is imprinted. The Faraday rotation systematically decreases with increasing distance from the black hole from 5,000 to 200,000 Schwarzschild radii, in good agreement with the gas density being inversely proportional to the distance. This behavior matches the theoretically expected signature of moderately magnetized winds, which can naturally serve as the external confining medium. The sign of the Faraday rotation is predominantly negative, suggesting that jet and accretion axis are misaligned and the jet emission exposes only one side of the toroidal magnetic fields in the winds. Our results demonstrate that winds are indeed a key element of the black hole inflow-outflow system.
