Topic:         Velocity correlation function: discrepancy between simulation and theory prediction
Time:         12/23 (Monday) 12:15 - 13:15
Place:          R1203
Abstract:
In future galaxy surveys such as the PFS survey using the Subaru Telescope, we will be able to measure not only the density fluctuation but also the velocity field up to very large scales. In order to see if the velocity information can be used to extract cosmological information, we measure the velocity correlation function of halos from N-body simulations compare it to the theoretical prediction. We find non-negligible discrepancies between them even on baryon acoustic oscillation scales due to the finite observational volume effect. We are now in the process to fit this discrepancy to understand the observational result and explain its physical meaning.

Topic:         Probing Cosmic Acceleration with Galaxy Clusters
Time:         12/26 (Thursday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:          R1203
Abstract:
The acceleration of the Universe is one of the biggest puzzles in
physics: is it due to a cosmological constant, dynamical dark energy,
or modification of gravity?  Galaxy clusters provide a unique
opportunity to answer this question.  In this talk, I will first
discuss how we use cluster abundances to constrain cosmic
acceleration, and how weak gravitational lensing effects play a key
role in cluster surveys.  I will then present my research on using
simulations to understand cluster weak lensing signals and to
accurately model covariance matrices.  These results not only mitigate
the systematic errors in current cluster surveys but also help the
optimization of future ground- and space-based missions.
