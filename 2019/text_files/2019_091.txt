***************************************************
Call for Proposals for KaVA (KVN and VERA Array) and EAVN (East Asian VLBI Network)
for the 2019B semester
Proposal submission deadline: 3rd June, 2019, 08:00 UT
***************************************************

*** Overview ***
  We invite proposals for open-use observations on KaVA (KVN and VERA Array)
and EAVN (East Asian VLBI Network), which is the international collaborative
VLBI array between China, Korea, and Japan. In the 2019B semester, 10 telescopes
(KaVA 7 telescopes (KVN 3 x 21 m and VERA 4 x 20 m), Nobeyama 45 m, Tianma
65 m, and Nanshan 26 m) will participate in the KaVA/EAVN open-use program.


*** Observing mode ***
  This open use call provides the opportunity of VLBI observations at 22 and
43 GHz. Basic VLBI observations with single polarization (LHCP) and a data
recording rate of 1 Gbps (total bandwidth of 256 MHz) is available for both
KaVA and EAVN, while additional observing modes are available for KaVA.
Especially, KaVA has a new observing mode, "astrometry mode", available
for the 2019B semester. Please refer to the KaVA/EAVN status report on KaVA/
EAVN websites for more details.


*** Telescope time ***
  The total available observation time for KaVA is up to 250 hours. Up to
100 hours out of KaVA's observation time of 250 hours is allocated to EAVN
observations. KaVA/EAVN observations will be scheduled between 1st September
2019 and 15th January 2020. Note that the total allocatable time and available
observing frequencies are different between each telescope. Please refer to
the KaVA/EAVN status report for more details.


*** Target of opportunity ***
  KaVA/EAVN accepts target of opportunity (ToO) proposals. Although proposers
can request the participation of Tianma and Nanshan as well as KaVA for ToO
observations, both Tianma and Nanshan will join only on a best effort basis.
Note that Nobeyama cannot be included for ToO proposals. It is strongly
recommended that ToO proposals (especially expected ToO) are submitted during
the regular Call for Proposals. Unexpected or urgent ToO can be submitted as
Director's Discretionary Time (DDT) proposals at any time. ToO proposals must
include clear triggering criteria to initiate an observation. ToOs are valid
for one year after it is approved. ToO proposals for DDT should follow the same
format of regular call and should be sent to eavnprop(at mark)kasi.re.kr.


*** Proposal submission ***
  The maximum observation time for a KaVA proposal is limited to 100 hours.
If requested, the observation time can be allocated over a year until 15th
June 2020, however the total observation time is still limited to 100 hours
even in this case. Note that the above-mentioned conditions are applicable
only to the KaVA's observing time, i.e., the maximum observing time for an
EAVN proposal is limited to 24 hours and the observation will be allocated
within a period in the 2019B semester. 
  Please refer to the KaVA/EAVN status report for detailed information about
the proposal format. The designated coversheet form can be downloaded via
KaVA/EAVN websites. Proposals should be submitted via EAVN website. Proposal
submission deadline is 3rd June 2019, 08:00 UT.


*** Special condition for selecting proposals ***
  All submitted proposals for KaVA/EAVN are reviewed by referees and the combined
KaVA/EAVN Time Allocation Committee (TAC) allocates the observing time based
on the referee's ratings. A proposal submitted for EAVN observations could be
allocated as KaVA observations depending on its rating and decisions made by
TAC. Proposers thus should specify the necessity of including Tianma, Nanshan,
and Nobeyama in your
observations.


*** KaVA/EAVN websites ***
  Please refer to the following KaVA and EAVN websites for more information
about the array capabilities and detailed conditions for proposal submission.

 *** NCU Colloquium ***

Speaker:    Dr Devendra Ojha (TIFR)
Date/Tim*e*:   June 12 (F), 16:00 (special date/time)
Room:   NCU, S4 Room 1013
Title:     Near Earth and Space Science Research using Balloon Platforms
Abstract:    The Balloon Facility of Tata Institute of Fundamental Research
(TIFR-BF) was established in December 1970 at Hyderabad. This is the only
major balloon facility in the world close to the geomagnetic equator. Since
its inception, the TIFR-BF has been launching zero pressure scientific
balloons every year for the study of various scientific applications
especially in the field of X-ray &amp; Infrared Astronomy, Astrobiology,
High Energy Physics and Atmospheric Science. The large variety of science
disciplines studied using scientific balloons include the study of the Sun,
the near Earth space environment - ionosphere, magnetosphere, aerosol
research, space plasma and its physics &amp; chemistry, interstellar dust
and cosmic ray particles. A unique feature of the TIFR-BF is that it has
all aspects of Scientific Ballooning, i.e., Balloon Design, Fabrication,
Payload Integration with Telemetry, Telecommand and other instrumentation,
and finally Balloon Launch, Tracking, Data Collection, Balloon Flight
Control, as also Payload Recovery, under one roof. The balloon production
at the facility is completely indigenous, i.e. balloon material, load
tapes, end fittings, bonding tape have been developed in-house. In recent
times, the TIFR-BF also designed and fabricated a balloon with carrying
capacity of 3 tons with 4 layers of 25 microns, and also oblate spheroids
of volume ranging from 10 m 3 to 100 m 3 for testing of newly developed
satellite payloads in laboratory at different conditions. The balloon
flight support instrumentation at the TIFR-BF has been regularly updated
with several innovations and advanced instrumentation for safe and highly
reliable flights. A continuous improvement in balloon flight support
instrumentation by the Control Instrumentation Group to keep in pace with
the growing complexities of the scientific payloads have contributed to the
total success of balloon flights conducted recently. In this talk, I will
present the details of the above mentioned developments and the future upgr=
ade
plans.



*** NCU-Delta Colloquium ***

Speaker:    Dr Chao-Lin Kuo  (Stanford U.)
Date/Tim*e*:   June 14 (F), 14:00
Room:   NCU, S4 Room 1013
Title:     Gravitational Waves from Big Bang
Abstract:    Inflation is a compelling theory that describes the process of
Big Bang. Many predictions of the inflation theory have been confirmed by
observations of cosmic microwave background (CMB) over the last decade. A
most exciting, yet unobserved prediction of inflation is the production of
a scale-invariant gravitational wave background, which would leave a
distinct imprint of =E2=80=9CB-mode=E2=80=9D polarization in the CMB. I wil=
l describe the
physics behind this prediction, the ongoing effort to search for this
signal, and the outlook for the next decade.



*** NCU Colloquium ***

Speaker:    Dr Devendra Ojha (TIFR)
Date/Tim*e*:   June 21 (F), 14:00
Room:   NCU, S4 Room 1013
Title:     Observational Signatures of Cloud-Cloud Collision in Galactic
Star-Forming Regions
Abstract:   The formation processes of massive OB stars and young stellar
clusters are still poorly understood. In recent years, the study of the
triggered star formation through the cloud-cloud collision (CCC) process
has become an interesting and important topic in the star formation
research. It has been suggested that the CCC process can form massive OB
stars and young stellar clusters at the junction of molecular clouds. The
onset of the CCC process in a given star-forming region could be
observationally inferred through the detection of a bridge feature
connecting the two clouds in velocity space, the broad CO line wing in the
intersection of the two clouds, and the complementary distribution of the
two colliding clouds. However, the investigation of observational
signatures of star formation (including massive stars) via the CCC
mechanism is still rare and very challenging. A multi-wavelength approach
has been effectively used as a promising observational tool for
understanding the ongoing physical processes in Galactic star-forming
regions. In this talk, new observational results of an analysis of some
promising Galactic star-forming regions will be presented, where the star
formation activities (including massive stars) appear to be influenced by
the CCC mechanism at the junction of molecular clouds.

*** Seminar ***
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:        Ue-Li Pen (CITA)
Topic:          Probing cosmic initial conditions with galaxy spin vectors
Time:           6/3 (Monday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Disk galaxies exhibit prominent rotation axis. We present recent results to predict the spin vector of galaxies.  Previously, the sign of the spin vector was thought random, with the direction correlated along the primordial tidal field.  New numerical studies show how the initial inertia tensor can be predicted, enabling the use of the signed galaxy spin vector field to probe the early universe, including effects of neutrinos, and testing cosmic parity violation. We discuss observables and future prospects.


*** Seminar ***
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:        Bo Reipurth (University of Hawaii)
Topic:          The Dynamical Evolution of Newborn Triple Systems
Time:           6/6 (Thursday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Observational evidence increasingly supports that most, if not all, stars are formed in small multiple systems, which through internal instabilities and external perturbations decay to produce the separation distribution function and multiplicity statistics of the field. I will summarize observations of newborn stars that document their enhanced multiplicity fraction and discuss them in terms of dynamical evolution during the earliest evolutionary stages based on extensive numerical simulations.  Various poorly understood phenomena in early stellar evolution find an explanation as a result of the dynamical evolution of multiple systems, including Herbig-Haro jets and FU Orionis eruptions, as well as the formation of spectroscopic binaries and the widest binaries.
