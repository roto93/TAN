Speaker:        Mei-Yin Chou / Locutus Huang / Kevin Koay (ASIAA)
Topic:          EHT and black hole shadows in the news and popular culture
Time:           4/22 (Monday) 12:15 - 13:15
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Since the Event Horizon Telescope press release on April 10, the image of the black hole shadow has received a lot of public attention, thanks to the various broadcast, written, online and social media. We will share some of the interesting and light-hearted articles, memes and anecdotes that have appeared, demonstrating how this iconic image has impacted popular culture in just a little more than a week. We also delve into some of the darker and more unfortunate effects this public attention has had on people and science in general.

Topic:          Imaging Black Holes with the Event Horizon Telescope
Time:           4/23 (Tuesday) 11:00 - 12:00
Place:           R1203

Topic:          WISDOM: Probing Supermassive Black Holes and their Immediate Environments with ALMA
Time:           4/24 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
I will present key results from the mm-Wave Interferometric Survey of
Dark Object Masses (WISDOM), a high resolution survey of molecular gas
in galaxy nuclei. First, I will show that CO can be used to easily and
accurately measure the mass of the supermassive black holes lurking at
galaxy centres. I will discuss substantial ongoing efforts to do this,
and present many spectacular new ALMA measurements, the latest of
which rival the best black hole measurements to date. This opens the
way to literally hundreds of measurements across the Hubble sequence
(in both active and non-active galaxies) with a unique method. Second,
I will briefly show how the same data allow to study the
spatially-resolved properties of the giant molecular clouds in all the
galaxies studied. This will yield cloud censuses in non-local galaxies
(including early-type galaxies) for the first time, providing a new
tool to understand and contrast the star formation efficiency across
galaxies. Already, it appears that basic cloud properties are not
universal and vary systematically along the Hubble sequence, contrary
to long-held assumptions.

Topic:          High resolution? Wide science field? AO projects at TMT and Subaru
Time:           4/25 (Thursday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
As telescopes become larger, the improvement and development of adaptive optics (AO) techniques become crucial to fully utilize their large aperture size. In this talk, I will briefly review the basics of AO, and then focus on two AO projects, NAFIRAOS at TMT and ULTIMATE at Subaru, as two opposite extreme spectrum of AO techniques. They both use multiple laser beams, but one is optimized to achieve highest spatial resolution in a narrow field whereas the other is optimized to achieve the largest science field with a moderate resolution.
