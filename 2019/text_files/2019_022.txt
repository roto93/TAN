*by* Yen-Chen Pan
*on* Understanding Type Ia Supernova with UV Spectroscopy
*at*  Feb/15 (F) 14:00 - 15:00 NCU S4-1013
*Abstract* Ultraviolet (UV) observations of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are
useful tools for understanding progenitor systems and explosion physics. In
particular, UV spectra of SNe Ia, which probe the outermost layers, are
strongly affected by the progenitor metallicity. Theory suggests that SN Ia
progenitor metallicity is correlated with its peak luminosity, but not its
light-curve shape. This effect should lead to an increased Hubble scatter,
reducing the precision with which we measure distances. If the mean
progenitor metallicity changes with redshift, cosmological measurements
could be biased. Models also indicate that changing progenitor metallicity
will have little effect on the appearance of optical SN data, but
significantly alter UV spectra. To address this problem, we reduced and
published the largest UV spectroscopic sample of SNe Ia to date. With this
sample, we confirm theoretical predictions that SN Ia UV spectra are strong
metallicity indicators. Our findings show that UV spectra are promising
tools to further our understanding of SN Ia while directly improving the
utility of SN Ia for cosmology.

*on* Faint Submillimeter Galaxies
*at* Feb 22 (F) 14:00 to 15:00
*Abstract* Submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) are high-redshift dust obscured
star-forming galaxies with extremely high star formation rate (10^2 to
>10^3 Msun/yr). They are widely regarded as progenitors of present-day
massive elliptical galaxies. They were first discovered in the late 90=E2=
=80=99s.
Since then, we have slowly accumulated knowledge about this special
population of galaxies. In the first decade since their discovery, most
observations focused on the brightest members in this population, because
of the limited sensitivities of submillimeter instruments. Such bright SMGs
are extremely luminous, but are not representative in the dusty galaxy
population. Thanks to the advent of sensitive interferometers and
wide-field cameras, we are now pushing our studies to much fainter SMGs,
i.e., more typical members in the dusty galaxy population. In this talk, I
will introduce our recent works on understanding the faint SMGs and their
relationship to normal galaxies.

*on* The Microphysics of AGN Feedback
*at* Feb 25 (M) 4:00 pm (*special date/time*) NCU S4 Room 1013
*Abstract* Feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) is one of the most
important processes governing the formation and evolution of galaxies and
galaxy clusters. It is believed to be responsible for inhibiting the
formation of massive galaxies and for solving the long-standing
"cooling-flow problem" in galaxy clusters. A lot of understanding of AGN
feedback has been gained using hydrodynamic simulations; however, some of
the relevant physical processes are unresolvable or not captured by pure
hydrodynamics, such as plasma effects and cosmic-ray (CR) physics. In this
talk, I will present how we use simulations that incorporate this
"microphysics" to understand how AGN jets feedback on galactic and cluster
scales. Specifically, I will discuss our recent progress on the
understanding of AGN heating in clusters, and how the heating processes
depends on the AGN jet composition. I will also talk about how we could use
multi-messenger observations of the Fermi bubbles as a nearby laboratory
for studying AGN feedback. Finally, I will conclude with open questions and
future prospects of applying simulations beyond hydrodynamics to various
interesting astrophysical systems.

The ALMA Configuration Schedule for Cycles 7, 8, and 9
Feb 15, 2019

A preview of the Cycles 7, 8, and 9 ALMA Configuration Schedule is now =
available. This schedule is being released to allow ALMA users to plan =
their proposal strategy for the next three Cycles. Note that the overall =
schedule may be modified depending on the outcomes of the proposal =
review process and the proposal pressure in the different =
configurations. While configurations C-1 through C-8 (with maximum =
baselines between 0.16 and 8.5 km) will be offered every cycle, users =
should note that configurations with baselines longer than 13 km (C-9 =
and C-10) are scheduled for Cycle 7 and 9 but not Cycle 8.

The Schedule is provided at the following link

Speaker:        Po-Sheng Ou (NTU/ASIAA)
Topic:          Modeling the Mass loss of Massive Stars with MESA
Time:           2/25 (Monday) 12:15 - 13:15
Place:           R1203


*** Special Seminar ***
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:        Kohei Hayashi (University of Tokyo)
Topic:          Galactic Archaeology: a unique probe of the nature of dark matter
Time:           2/25 (Monday) 11:00 - 12:00
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Dark matter is now known to be the vital ingredient for the growth of structure in the Universe, while its nature remains a mystery.
Galaxies in the Local Group are excellent laboratories to shed light on the nature of dark matter and its role in the galaxy formation.
This is because these galaxies are sufficiently close to measure photometry, spectroscopy, and astrometry for their resolved stars, and this information enables us to study their chemo-dynamical structures in detail. Such studies are so-called "Galactic Archaeology".
In particular, dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies are ideal sites for studying the basic properties of dark matter as they are largely dark-matter dominated.
Revealing dark matter distributions in dSphs is of crucial importance in testing dark matter models and constraining particle candidate of dark matter.
In this talk, I will discuss dark halo structures in the dSphs through our dynamical analysis of their current available data.
I will also discuss how dynamical studies for the dSphs can place constraints on the nature of dark matter.
I will also present the future prospects for Galactic Archaeology science with deep and wide-field photometric and spectroscopic surveys, especially Subaru-HSC and PFS.

Speaker:        Ippei Obata (The University of Tokyo)
Topic:          Axion Dark Matter Search with Optical Cavity Experiment
Time:           2/26 (Tuesday) 11:00 - 12:00
Place:           R812
Abstract:
The outline of this talk is mainly based on our recent paper 10.1103/PhysRevLett.121.161301. In this talk, I will present a novel experimental approach to search for axion dark matter which does not need a conventional strong magnetic field but use an optical cavity. This new method aims to measure the difference of phase velocity between two circular-polarized photons which is caused by the coupling to axion dark matter. The experimental sensitivity is in principle only limited by quantum noise which enables us to probe tiny axion-photon coupling  g_{aÎ³} <~ 10^{âˆ’11}GeV^{-1} with axion mass range m_a <~ 10^{-10}eV, which is competitive with other experimental proposals.  If I have time, I will also discuss the possibility to test axion dark matter with ongoing and upcoming gravitational wave detectors by using a scheme similar to our proposed method.



*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:        Takafumi Ootsubo (JAXA)
Topic:          Comets, asteroids, and interplanetary dust observed with 
infrared satellites: from AKARI to SPICA
Time:           2/27 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
AKARI, the Japanese infrared astronomical satellite, was launched 
in February 2006 and made a number of pointed observations for 
deep imaging and spectroscopy together with the all-sky survey. 
The data of the AKARI observations are essential not only for 
the studies of the Galactic and extragalactic sciences, but also 
for the Solar System sciences on comets, asteroids, TNOs, and 
interplanetary dust. AKARI has already provided many precious 
survey data sets and outcomes for the Solar System sciences, 
including the asteroid catalog and the zodiacal emission map.

AKARI has a spectroscopic capability in near- and mid-infrared 
wavelength region. We carried out spectroscopic observations 
for tens of asteroids and comets in 2.5-5 micron. AKARI detects 
clear absorption/emission features related to hydrated minerals 
in many asteroids and carbon dioxide in cometary comae. 
AKARI also made the spectroscopy of the zodiacal emission in 
the mid-infrared (5.5 to 12.5 micron) and detected the silicate 
feature around 10-micron region toward the various ecliptic 
latitude regions. These data sets provide us the information 
on the physicochemical environment in the early solar nebula. 

SPICA (Space Infrared Telescope for Cosmology and Astrophysics) 
is an ESA-JAXA joint mission for infrared astrophysics after 
AKARI, Spitzer and Herschel. SPICA covers infrared wavelength 
(12 to 230 micron) region spectroscopically with the scientific 
instruments SMI and SAFARI. In this talk, I will summarize the 
successful results of AKARI and introduce the SPICA science 
goals on the Solar System sciences.
