Speaker: Prof. Kuo-Chuan Pan (NTHU)
Date/Time: May 3, 14:00
Room: NCU, S4 Room 1013
Title:  Multimessenger Signals from Core-Collapse Supernovae
Abstract: Core-collapse supernovae, which came from stellar explosions of
very massive stars at the end of their lifetime, are expected to be a
significant science target of gravitational wave detectors and high energy
MeV neutrino detectors. In addition to observations of its electromagnetism
emissions, combing observation data with its gravitational wave or neutrino
signals enables us to comprehensively explore the underlying physics from a
single source associated with different physical processes. In this talk, I
would like to highlight the recent theoretical developments of
core-collapse supernovae as multimessenger sources.
