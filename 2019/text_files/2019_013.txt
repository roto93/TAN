Dear Yi-Jehng,

The SMA call for standard proposals (2019A semester) is announced.
The submission deadline is Mar. 8 (Fri.) 5 a.m. in Taiwan time.
I would appreciate it if you could circulate it to TAN.

Regards,
Naomi

> Dear Colleagues,
>=20
> The SMA is a reconfigurable interferometric array of eight 6-meter =
antennas on Maunakea jointly built and operated by the Smithsonian =
Astrophysical Observatory and the Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy =
and Astrophysics. The array operates in the 230, 345, and 400 GHz bands.
>=20
> We are happy to announce that we are now accepting Standard Proposals =
for use of the Submillimeter Array (SMA).  The deadline for Standard =
Proposals is 07 March 2019 at 21:00 GMT.
>=20
> The SMA has recently completed significant upgrades in observational =
capability, with more under way. Currently, the SMA observes =
simultaneously with two orthogonally polarized receivers, one in the 230 =
GHz or 345 GHz band and the other in the 240 GHz or 400 GHz band (with =
full polarimetric observations available using the 230+240 GHz or =
345+400 GHz combinations).
>=20
> The SWARM correlator processes 8 GHz bandwidth for each receiver in =
each sideband, for a total of 32 GHz, at a uniform 140 kHz resolution. =
This 32 GHz frequency coverage can be continuous where the tuning ranges =
overlap for the two orthogonally polarized receivers. In short, the SMA =
now provides flexible, wide band frequency coverage that delivers high =
continuum sensitivity and excellent spectral line capabilities (at 140 =
kHz spectral resolution).
>=20
> A full track offers continuum sensitivity of 200 or 600 micro-Jy (1 =
sigma) at 230 or 345 GHz in good weather conditions (precipitable water =
vapor 2.5 mm and 1.0 mm, respectively). The corresponding line =
sensitivities at 1 km/s resolution are 35 and 80 mJy. The small antennas =
allow access to low spatial frequencies in the subcompact configuration, =
and at the other extreme, the finest angular resolution with the very =
extended configuration at 345 GHz is ~0.25". The compact and extended =
configurations complete the range.
>=20
> Thus, in some ways, the characteristics and performance of the SMA are =
both similar and complementary to those of the standalone Atacama =
Compact Array component of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter =
Array. For more information about SMA capabilities, visit the SMA =
Observer Center website <http://sma1.sma.hawaii.edu/status.html> and =
explore the set of SMA proposing tools =
<http://sma1.sma.hawaii.edu/tools.html>. Current and archived SMA =
Newsletters <https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/sma/Newsletters/> available =
online provide a sampling of the wide variety of science possible with =
the SMA.

the Large Scale program, with a proposal deadline of 13 Feb 2019, =
required an NOI to be submitted in January. =20
