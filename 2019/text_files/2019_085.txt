Speaker:        Howard Yee (University of Toronto)
Topic:          H-alpha Imaging Spectroscopy of Cluster Galaxies Using SITELLE
Time:           5/30 (Thursday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
SITELLE is an 11'x11' field-of-view imaging Fourier transform spectrograph
(iFTS) on CFHT. I will briefly describe the history of iFTS and the
capability of this new, unique, IFU-like instrument.  We have started
a program to use SITELLE to study the H-alpha emission in star-forming
galaxies in a sample of z~0.25 galaxy clusters. I will describe the
current data on two clusters, Abell 2390 and Abell 2465, and the
pipeline we developed to generate complete samples of cluster emission-line
galaxies (ELGs). I will present some initial results from the data, in
particular, the alignment of the difference vectors between emission-line 
and continuum light with the cluster center, a signature of ram pressure
in operation; and the strong emission region in the core of the Brightest
Cluster Galaxy in Abell 2390.   I will end with a discussion of the 
prospect of using SITELLE for large surveys of emission-line galaxies, 
such as the survey for Lyman-alpha galaxies at z ~ 3 to 6.
