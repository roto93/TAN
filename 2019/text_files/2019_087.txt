Dear colleagues,

This is a reminder that the proposal submission deadline for KaVA (KVN and VERA
Array) and EAVN (East Asian VLBI Network) is approaching to June 3, 8:00 UT.
Please visit the following website for KaVA/EAVN proposal submission since there
is an additional notification to EAVN proposers appeared on May 8.

https://radio.kasi.re.kr/kava/proposal_info.php

Please refer also to the following KaVA and EAVN websites for more details about
each array.

** EAVN: http://eavn.kasi.re.kr/


Best regards,

Kiyoaki Wajima
(KASI; in place of KaVA/EAVN directors)

***************************************************
Call for Proposals for KaVA (KVN and VERA Array) and EAVN (East Asian VLBI Network)
for the 2019B semester
Proposal submission deadline: 3rd June, 2019, 08:00 UT
***************************************************

*** Overview ***
  We invite proposals for open-use observations on KaVA (KVN and VERA Array)
and EAVN (East Asian VLBI Network), which is the international collaborative
VLBI array between China, Korea, and Japan. In the 2019B semester, 10 telescopes
(KaVA 7 telescopes (KVN 3 x 21 m and VERA 4 x 20 m), Nobeyama 45 m, Tianma
65 m, and Nanshan 26 m) will participate in the KaVA/EAVN open-use program.


*** Observing mode ***
  This open use call provides the opportunity of VLBI observations at 22 and
43 GHz. Basic VLBI observations with single polarization (LHCP) and a data
recording rate of 1 Gbps (total bandwidth of 256 MHz) is available for both
KaVA and EAVN, while additional observing modes are available for KaVA.
Especially, KaVA has a new observing mode, "astrometry mode", available
for the 2019B semester. Please refer to the KaVA/EAVN status report on KaVA/
EAVN websites for more details.


*** Telescope time ***
  The total available observation time for KaVA is up to 250 hours. Up to
100 hours out of KaVA's observation time of 250 hours is allocated to EAVN
observations. KaVA/EAVN observations will be scheduled between 1st September
2019 and 15th January 2020. Note that the total allocatable time and available
observing frequencies are different between each telescope. Please refer to
the KaVA/EAVN status report for more details.


*** Target of opportunity ***
  KaVA/EAVN accepts target of opportunity (ToO) proposals. Although proposers
can request the participation of Tianma and Nanshan as well as KaVA for ToO
observations, both Tianma and Nanshan will join only on a best effort basis.
Note that Nobeyama cannot be included for ToO proposals. It is strongly
recommended that ToO proposals (especially expected ToO) are submitted during
the regular Call for Proposals. Unexpected or urgent ToO can be submitted as
Director's Discretionary Time (DDT) proposals at any time. ToO proposals must
include clear triggering criteria to initiate an observation. ToOs are valid
for one year after it is approved. ToO proposals for DDT should follow the same
format of regular call and should be sent to eavnprop(at mark)kasi.re.kr.


*** Proposal submission ***
  The maximum observation time for a KaVA proposal is limited to 100 hours.
If requested, the observation time can be allocated over a year until 15th
June 2020, however the total observation time is still limited to 100 hours
even in this case. Note that the above-mentioned conditions are applicable
only to the KaVA's observing time, i.e., the maximum observing time for an
EAVN proposal is limited to 24 hours and the observation will be allocated
within a period in the 2019B semester. 
  Please refer to the KaVA/EAVN status report for detailed information about
the proposal format. The designated coversheet form can be downloaded via
KaVA/EAVN websites. Proposals should be submitted via EAVN website. Proposal
submission deadline is 3rd June 2019, 08:00 UT.


*** Special condition for selecting proposals ***
  All submitted proposals for KaVA/EAVN are reviewed by referees and the combined
KaVA/EAVN Time Allocation Committee (TAC) allocates the observing time based
on the referee's ratings. A proposal submitted for EAVN observations could be
allocated as KaVA observations depending on its rating and decisions made by
TAC. Proposers thus should specify the necessity of including Tianma, Nanshan,
and Nobeyama in your
observations.


*** KaVA/EAVN websites ***
  Please refer to the following KaVA and EAVN websites for more information
about the array capabilities and detailed conditions for proposal submission.
