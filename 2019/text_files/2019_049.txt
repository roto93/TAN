TDLI Summer School on Computational Astrophysics

May 15-24, 2019

The Tsung-Dao Lee Institute (TDLI) in Shanghai, China, is organising a 
series of Summer Schools in the field of Computational Astrophysics. 
This 3rd School in the series will be on Radiative Transfer, one of the 
most challenging yet ubiquitous pieces of physics. In particular as 
multi-messenger astrophysics gains popularity, being able to actually 
decipher the message is indispensable.

The 2019 TDLI Summer School on Computational Astrophysics will take 
place from May 15 to 24, 2019 in the Tsung-Dao Lee Institute (TDLI) on 
the Minhang Campus of Shanghai Jiao Tong University in Shanghai, China. 
Prof. D. John Hillier from University of Pittsburgh, USA will be the 
lecturer. The main goal of this School is to teach students how to 
understand, use, and write radiative transfer codes. Prof. Hillier's 
expertise is in stellar atmospheres and stellar outflows. He is 
developer of the publicly available radiative transfer code CMFGEN, for 
which he will also provide a brief "boot camp" as part of these lectures.

The School is designed for graduate students with significant research 
experience in astrophysics and beginning postdoctoral researchers. 
Interested applicant should ask his/her research advisor to send a 
recommendation letter to Professors Alexander Heger 
(alexander.heger@monash.edu) and Yong-Zhong Qian (qian@physics.umn.edu).

Applications received prior to April 14, 2019 will be given full 
consideration. Please pre-register at 
http://tdli.sjtu.edu.cn/Web/yjxy/5130083-5130000000518.htm

Approximately 30 participants will be accepted. Attendance for the 
entire duration of the School is required. The TDLI will arrange lodging 
(two students per room) for the nights of May 14-24, 2019 and lunches on 
lecture days of the School for all participants. There is a registration 
fee of RMB 4,000 or US $600, which covers lodging, lunches, reception, 
banquet, and coffee breaks.
