Dear all,

    The ALMA Cycle 8 Pre-announcement has been released.

    The Joint ALMA Observatory (JAO) will start the next cycle of observations (Cycle 8) in October 2020. A Call for Proposals (CfP) with detailed information on Cycle 8 will be issued in March 2020 and the deadline for proposal submission will be in April 2020. This pre-announcement highlights aspects of the Cycle 8 CfP to assist with early planning.

    The key dates (anticipated) for Cycle 8 are:
        19 December 2019        Cycle 8 pre-announcement
        17 March 2020            Release of the ALMA Cycle 8 Call for Proposals and Observing Tool, and opening of archive for proposal submission
        15 April 2020            Proposal submission deadline
        End of July 2020        Results of the proposal review sent to proposers
        9 September 2020        Deadline for phase 2 submission by PIs or designees
        15 September 2020        Release of ACA Supplemental Call for Proposals
        1 October 2020            Start of Cycle 8 observations
        8 October 2020               Supplemental Call deadline

    New in Cycle 8    â€”    In Cycle 8, the following technical capabilities will be available for the first time:
        â€¢ Solar observations in Band 5
        â€¢ VLBI observations of faint science targets (correlated flux density <500 mJy within an unresolved core on ALMA baselines up to 1 km). These observations will be done in passive phasing mode, where it is recommended to have a bright calibrator within 5 deg of the science target.
        â€¢ High-frequency observations (Bands 9 and 10) with the stand-alone 7-m Array
        â€¢ Mosaicking of continuum linear polarization observations (Bands 3 to 7)
        â€¢ Spectral scans with the 7-m Array

    Dual-Anonymous Proposal Review
         Proposals in Cycle 8 will implement a dual-anonymous process for proposal reviews. While proposers will still enter their names and affiliations in the Observing Tool, their identities will be concealed from the reviewers. It will be the responsibility of the investigators to write their proposals such that anonymity is preserved. Guidelines on how to prepare such proposals will be presented in a forthcoming ALMA news item and, later, in the CfP.

NTHU 1-Day Workshop on Bayesian analysis and machine learning
January 8, NTHU

The Institute of Astronomy and the Center for Informatics and Computation
in Astronomy (CICA) at National Tsing Hua University will organise a 1-day
workshop on Bayesian analysis and machine learning on January 8 (Wed).
Everyone is welcome and the details are as follows:

Date: January 8, 2020 (Wed)
Venue: R521 of Institute of Astronomy (General Building II, 5/F), NTHU

Programme:

9:30am - 12:30pm: Bayesian analysis in astronomy (David Yu, University of
Hong Kong)
2pm - 5pm: Machine learning in astronomy (David Hui, Chungnam National
University, Korea)

We will also arrange some hands-on activities. If you are interested in the
hands-on activities, please contact Prof. Albert Kong (akong _AT_

*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________
Speaker:    Daichi Hiramatsu (UCSB)
Topic:         Recent Advancements in Core-collapse Supernova Observation Through the Global Supernova Project
Time:         1/8 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:          R1203
Abstract:
upernovae are among the most influential events in every astrophysical scale. New wide-field and high-cadence transient surveys enable us to watch supernovae from the moment of explosion. Paired with rapid and continuous monitoring facilities, these observations reveal unprecedented features that bridge our understanding of their progenitor systems to explosion mechanisms. From the discovery to follow-up, the Global Supernova Project is a world-wide collaboration of +150 supernova observers and theorists facilitated with the Las Cumbres Observatory and various other ground and space telescopes. In this talk, I will highlight the recent advancements in core-collapse supernova observation, especially in the context of the Global Supernova Project.
