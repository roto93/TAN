Dear Professor Kuan,

I should appreciate it if you could advertise the following information to TAN.

--------------
In ASIAA/TIARA (theoretical astrophysics group), we will offer introductory 
lectures on hydrodynamics (HD) and magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), as 
a preparation of the Science Discussion Meetings in TIARA, which will start 
after the introductory lectures.  Since HD courses are not offered in Taiwan 
for undergraduates, graduate students (or junior/senior undergraduate 
students) in any institute/University are encouraged to participate.

Dates: April 19 (Fr), 26 (Fr), May 3 (Fr)
Time: 14:00-17:00
Place: Room R1108, AS/NTU Astronomy-Mathematics Building, 
            National Taiwan University, No.1, Sec. 4, Roosevelt Rd, Taipei 

Lecturer: Kouichi Hirotani (ASIAA/TIARA)

Syllabus:
Chapter 1  Hydrodynamics
    Section 1  The continuity equation
    Section 2  The Lagrangian derivative
    Section 3  The Euler equation
    Section 4  Hydrostatics
    Section 5  The Bernouilli's theorem
    Section 6  Energy conservation
    Section 7  Sound waves and gravity waves

Chapter 2  Newtonian Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)
    Section 1  Electromagnetic equations
    Section 2  Plasma equations 
    Section 3  Dimensionless parameters

Lecture note will be provided as a copy of power point files.
