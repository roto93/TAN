Dear Yi-Jehng

  Could you help to circulate the following message about EA ALMA Development Workshop? Thanks.


***********************************************
EA ALMA Development Workshop 2019
Large Seminar Room, NAOJ, Mitaka
December 10-11, 2019

https://alma-intweb.mtk.nao.ac.jp/~diono/meetings/EA_ALMA_WS_2019/

***********************************************

The Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) is now routinely producing groundbreaking scientific results in almost all fields of astronomy and astrophysics.  In order to maintain ALMA as the most advanced (sub)mm-wave array in the coming decades, all ALMA partners are now striving to realize the goals presented in the ALMA Development Roadmap. The East Asian ALMA has been holding the EA ALMA Development Workshop every year, with the main aim to present the latest technological advancement and exchange ideas which are relevant to the upgrade of ALMA. This annual workshop is intended to become an effective forum for interaction and discussion between the technical and scientific communities, and the input from the community is key in the establishment of the EA ALMA Development Program. Last year, the main focus of the workshop was "wide IF", which is recognized as the highest priority in the ALMA Development Roadmap. This year, we would like to invite talks and di!
 scussion related to high frequency (bands 8, 9 and 10) observations of ALMA and related hardware and software development.  Apart from this major focus, we will welcome contributions in the fields of antennas, front-ends, back-ends, and software development and related talks in science, science operations and/or commissioning of new capabilities.

Timeline:
July 5, 2019 First announcement
September 10, 2019 Start registration
November 8, 2019 Deadline for registration and abstracts
December 10-11, 2019 Workshop

The workshop is open for contributed presentation or poster. Please visit the website for details.

Speaker:    You-Hua Chu (ASIAA)
Topic:         Writing recommendation and evaluation letters
Time:         9/23 (Monday) 12:15 - 13:15
Place:          R1203


*** ASIAA/NTU Joint Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________
Speaker:    Richard Ellis (UCL)
Topic:         Cosmic Dawn: The Observational Quest for the First Galaxies
Time:         9/24 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:          CCMS R104
Abstract:
The birth of galaxies represents the last unexplored frontier of cosmic history and it is commonly believed such early systems led to the transformation of neutral gas in the intergalactic medium into its present fully-ionised state. Some progress has been made in charting the demographics of early galaxies into the era when reionisation is thought to occur, but little is known about the nature of their stellar populations, the possible role of active nuclei and whether galaxies are capable of generating sufficient ionising radiation. Spectroscopy holds the key to addressing these questions, targeting both individual sources at high redshift as well as carefully-chosen analogues at intermediate redshift. I will describe the recent progress and challenges as we anticipate the launch of the James Webb Space Telescope and the arrival of next-generation large telescopes.


*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________
Speaker:    Richard Ellis (UCL)
Topic:         The Remarkable Assembly History of Elliptical Galaxies
Time:         9/25 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:          R1203
Abstract:
Once considered the simplest morphological class with smooth surface brightness profiles and homogenous old stellar populations, elliptical galaxies continue to reveal surprises.
I will present the results of several comprehensive spectroscopic campaigns of what are
considered to be the precursors of present-day ellipticals seen at redshifts up to and beyond 2. Good signal to noise absorption line spectra are capable of probing the stellar kinematics and stellar populations in early examples providing valuable insight into the assembly history of passive galaxies. I will discuss several puzzles that have emerged from such data including how the compact precursors (or `red nuggetsâ€™) grew in physical size but hardly in stellar mass, and why early massive examples display rapidly rotating stellar disks in contrast with local examples.
