Abstract:
Photometric observations of galaxies over the last decades have revealed many important clues in the understanding of galaxy evolution. Despite the current improvement in spatial resolution of the imaging surveys (by HST in particular), most of the photometric studies of galaxies have only been done by treating galaxy as a single point object. On the other hand, the advent of IFU surveys has revolutionized the way we study galaxies. Despite its powerful capabilities, wide area IFU surveys have only limited to local galaxies. In this presentation, I will introduce a spatially resolved SED fitting method that uses broad bands imaging to derive spatially resolved stellar population properties of galaxies. I will present results of our studies on the spatially resolved analysis of stellar mass buildup and quenching in massive disk galaxies from z~2 to present time. We studied the evolution of the radial profiles of SFR, stellar mass, and sSFR and construct an evolutionary empiri!
cal model. We also confirmed the existence of sub-galactic star formation main sequence which holds in local as well as high redshift. Our studies found that massive disk galaxies built their stellar masses and quenched their star formations in 'inside-out' manner. I will also talk about my efforts on upgrading the method using MCMC technique to get a better inference of stellar population parameters (Z, age, E(B-V), and SFH). Currently, we have applied our spatially resolved SED fitting method to imaging data from HST and GALEX+SDSS. Future photometric surveys (using JWST, WFIRST, LSST, and Euclid) will provide large dataset from which we can conduct spatially resolved SED fitting to a large number of galaxies across wide redshift range to study the evolution of their internal structures.
