Second announcement:
----------------------

ALMA2019: Science Results and Cross-Facility Synergies
--------------------------------------------------------

Dear colleagues,

Registration has now opened for the next ALMA-wide science
conference, to be held from 14-18 October 2019 in Cagliari, Sardinia,
Italy.

The Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) is the world's
most sensitive facility for millimeter/submillimeter astronomical
observations, and will soon be fully operational in all of the
originally planned bands.  Since its first observations, ALMA has
routinely delivered groundbreaking scientific results that span nearly
all areas of astrophysics.

Following conferencences in Puerto Varas (Chile, 2012), Tokyo (Japan,
2014), and Indian Wells (USA, 2016), the ALMA partnership is
organizing the next ALMA Science Conference in Cagliari (Sardinia,
Italy) on October 14-18, 2019.

At the conference we expect to discuss the full breadth of ALMA
science, with special emphasis on results from the first rounds of
ALMA Large Programmes, the long baselines and high frequency
capabilities, the new Solar and VLBI modes, as well as the synergy
between ALMA and other observatories. Science topics will include all
fields of astronomy, from cosmology and galaxies in the distant
Universe, nearby galaxies and the Galactic Center, interstellar medium
and star formation in our Galaxy, astrochemistry, circumstellar disks,
exoplanets, solar system, stellar evolution, and the Sun.

As in previous editions of the conference series, we expect to discuss
the scientific priorities for the implementation of the ALMA
Development Roadmap.
