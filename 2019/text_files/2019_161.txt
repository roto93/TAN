Announcement:
The East-Asian ALMA Science Workshop is an annual workshop to promote
regional collaborations in ALMA science in East Asia. We are pleased to
announce that the next EA ALMA Science Workshop will be hosted by Academia
Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics on Feb 19 to 21 in Taipei,
Taiwan. In this three-day workshop, we invite all scientists in East Asia
to present their ALMA-related studies, to propose new scientific questions,
and to seek new collaborations. We also welcome astronomers who do not use
to work in the millimeter/submillimeter to present ideas that may involve
ALMA in multi-wavelength and multi-messenger studies. We will feature
invited talks to review the latest progress in various fields, and
discussion sessions for brainstorming future directions.

Registration deadline:
