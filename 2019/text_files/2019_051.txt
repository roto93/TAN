 ** NCU Colloquium ***

Speaker: Shih-Ping Lai (NTHU)
Date/Time: April 12, 14:00
Room: NCU, S4 Room 1013
Title: Baby Stars' Magnetized Cradles
Abstract:
Whether the magnetic field plays a critical role in star formation" is a
hotly debated topic persisting for
several decades.  The problem remains unsolved mostly due to lack of data
with sufficient signal-to-noise ratios.  In the past few years, thanks to
the new telescope (ALMA) and the new instrument (Pol-2 on JCMT), the
quality and quantity of magnetic field data improved drastically.   With
these
impressive data, can we finally settle the debate?

TDLI Summer School in Computational Astrophysics (May 15-24, 2019)

TDLI Summer School on Computational Astrophysics

May 15-24, 2019

The Tsung-Dao Lee Institute (TDLI) in Shanghai, China, is organising a 
series of Summer Schools in the field of Computational Astrophysics. 
This 3rd School in the series will be on Radiative Transfer, one of the 
most challenging yet ubiquitous pieces of physics. In particular as 
multi-messenger astrophysics gains popularity, being able to actually 
decipher the message is indispensable.

The 2019 TDLI Summer School on Computational Astrophysics will take 
place from May 15 to 24, 2019 in the Tsung-Dao Lee Institute (TDLI) on 
the Minhang Campus of Shanghai Jiao Tong University in Shanghai, China. 
Prof. D. John Hillier from University of Pittsburgh, USA will be the 
lecturer. The main goal of this School is to teach students how to 
understand, use, and write radiative transfer codes. Prof. Hillier's 
expertise is in stellar atmospheres and stellar outflows. He is 
developer of the publicly available radiative transfer code CMFGEN, for 
which he will also provide a brief "boot camp" as part of these lectures.

The School is designed for graduate students with significant research 
experience in astrophysics and beginning postdoctoral researchers. 
Interested applicant should ask his/her research advisor to send a 
recommendation letter to Professors Alexander Heger 
(alexander.heger@monash.edu) and Yong-Zhong Qian (qian@physics.umn.edu).

Applications received prior to April 14, 2019 will be given full 
consideration. Please pre-register at 
http://tdli.sjtu.edu.cn/Web/yjxy/5130083-5130000000518.htm

Approximately 30 participants will be accepted. Attendance for the 
entire duration of the School is required. The TDLI will arrange lodging 
(two students per room) for the nights of May 14-24, 2019 and lunches on 
lecture days of the School for all participants. There is a registration 
fee of RMB 4,000 or US $600, which covers lodging, lunches, reception, 
banquet, and coffee breaks.

Dear colleague,

We would be most grateful if you could distribute the message below among your national community, on behalf of the Office for Young Astronomers (OYA) and its program of International Schools for Young Astronomers (ISYA). We are aiming to reach the young astronomers in your country. There will be full-support grants by the OYA and the Chinese host institutions for the selected students to attend the next ISYA, that will happen in Kunming, China, in October-November 2019.  

King regards,

Itziar Aretxaga and David Mota

ISYA Program Director and Deputy Director



The 42nd International School for Young Astronomers, ISYA2019, will take place in Kunming, China, from the 14th of October to the 3th of November 2019. The International School for Young Astronomers (ISYA) is a long-tradition project of the International Astronomical Union (IAU), nowadays also co-sponsored by the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters (NASL) through the Office for Young Astronomers (OYA). The 42nd school is co-organized by the OYA, and the Yunnan Observatories (YNOs) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).

ISYAs are three-week international postgraduate schools for regions where students have less opportunity to be directly exposed to the full extent of up-to-date astrophysics. They have the purpose of broadening the young students' perspective from international lecturers with up-to-date astrophysics, both on theory and observations. This three-week school will be also beneficial for the academic exchanges within countries, in particular in Asia. Young students of Astronomy, Astrophysics and related sciences will be brought together, and the mutual understanding and friendship between them will be promoted for future collaboration.

Students and young professionals within a broad range of education and experience, from senior undergraduate to postdoctoral level, are welcome to the ISYA2019 held in China. Preference will be given to students in their early career, MSc/PhDs. Priority will be given to applicants from East and Southeast Asia, but other nationalities will also be considered.

Acceptance to the school includes a studentship that covers transportation to Kunming and back to the students¡¦ home location, and full boarding at the ISYA. All selected students are expected to commit 100% of their time to the three-week long program and participate in all scheduled activities.

Registration is now open at http://isya2019.csp.escience.cn/
