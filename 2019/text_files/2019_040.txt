Speaker:        Miikka VÃ¤isÃ¤lÃ¤ (ASIAA)
Topic:          Basics of GPU programming with CUDA
Time:           3/25 (Monday) 12:15 - 13:15
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
GPUs have been rising in popularity in scientific computing, but what programming them actually involves? I will introduce you to the basic practical methods of GPU programming using Nvidia CUDA API - with some reflections on the lessons learned during the continuing development of the Astaroth code for computing MHD problems with high-order finite differences.



*** Colloquium ***

Speaker:        Miho Ishigaki (Tohoku)
Topic:          Element production by supernovae across the cosmic time probed by metal-poor stars
Time:           3/27 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Supernova explosions have been a dominant contributor of metals in the Universe. Thanks to recent large spectroscopic surveys of metal-poor stars 
in our Milky Way Galaxy, unprecedentedly large data sets of
elemental abundances in the atmosphere of metal-poor, and thus likely very old, stars  are now available. Statistical properties of the measured elemental abundances have put useful constraints on nucleosynthetic yields of supernovae of different generations of stars. I would like to review what we can learn from comparison between observed elemental abundances in metal-poor stars and   
theoretical supernova yield models, including core-collapse supernovae
of the very first generation of stars and Type Ia supernovae of various progenitor metalicities. Prospects for future large spectroscopic surveys in the
outskirt of the Milky Way will also be discussed.
