Title: The Contribution of Dwarf Planets to the Origin of Jupiter Family
Comets
Abstract:
In this work we explore the long-term dynamical evolution of a bias-free
orbital representation of the Kuiper belt, the so-called L7 synthetic model
from CFEPS, under the gravitational influence of the Sun and the four giant
planets, as well as of the 34 largest known TNOs, those with
visual absolute magnitude H_V < 4, among which are the four objects
currently classified as dwarf planets by the IAU (Pluto, Eris, Haumea, and
Makemake); however, in this work we indistinctively call Dwarf Planets
(DPs) to all the objects in our 34 members set. Over 1 Gyr  time-scales, we
 analyzed the secular influence of the DPs over Kuiper belt particles and
their contribution to the injection rate of new visible Jupiter Family
Comets (JFCs), as they make their way from the Scattering, Resonant, and
Classical populations to the inner Solar System. We found that  DPs
effectively increase the number of new visible JFCs originating from the
Classical and Resonant populations in almost 20%, when compared with the
number of comets produced by the giant planets alone. For the
Scattering population the increment is marginal but noticeable. Given the
rate of escapes from the Kuiper belt enhanced by DPs, 20% less objects in
the Classical and Resonant populations are required to supply the number of
JFCs currently observed. Considering recent estimates of the injection rate
of  new comets  required to maintain the population  of JFCs in steady
state, the maximum numbers of 1 to 10 km sized objects required to supply
the 100% of new JFCs are: =E2=88=BC5.9=C3=9710^7, =E2=88=BC1.0=C3=9710^8, a=
nd =E2=88=BC2.9=C3=9710^8 for the
Scattering, Resonant, and Classical populations, respectively. By comparing
with the  number of objects in the same size range expected to be present
on each of these populations from recent cratering records predictions on
the surface of 2014 MU69, we provide some estimates of the fractional
contribution of each population to new visible JFCs. Additionally, we found
that the Plutinos are the most important source of comets originally coming
from a resonant configuration, where the presence of Pluto and the large
plutinos Orcus, 2003 AZ84, and Ixion, are important to increase the number
of unstable 3:2 resonators. On the other hand, the twotinos and
the populations in the 5:3 and 5:2 mean motion resonances with Neptune all
supply a comparable amount of new visible JFCs. <wchen@astro.ncu.edu.tw>
