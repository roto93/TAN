 ** NCU Colloquium ***

Speaker: Shih-Ping Lai (NTHU)
Date/Time: April 12, 14:00
Room: NCU, S4 Room 1013
Title: Baby Stars' Magnetized Cradles
Abstract:
Whether the magnetic field plays a critical role in star formation" is a
hotly debated topic persisting for
several decades.  The problem remains unsolved mostly due to lack of data
with sufficient signal-to-noise ratios.  In the past few years, thanks to
the new telescope (ALMA) and the new instrument (Pol-2 on JCMT), the
quality and quantity of magnetic field data improved drastically.   With
these
impressive data, can we finally settle the debate?
