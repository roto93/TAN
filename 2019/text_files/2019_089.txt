 *** NCU Colloquium ***

Speaker:    Dr Devendra Ojha (TIFR)
Date/Tim*e*:   June 12 (F), 16:00 (special date/time)
Room:   NCU, S4 Room 1013
Title:     Near Earth and Space Science Research using Balloon Platforms
Abstract:    The Balloon Facility of Tata Institute of Fundamental Research
(TIFR-BF) was established in December 1970 at Hyderabad. This is the only
major balloon facility in the world close to the geomagnetic equator. Since
its inception, the TIFR-BF has been launching zero pressure scientific
balloons every year for the study of various scientific applications
especially in the field of X-ray &amp; Infrared Astronomy, Astrobiology,
High Energy Physics and Atmospheric Science. The large variety of science
disciplines studied using scientific balloons include the study of the Sun,
the near Earth space environment - ionosphere, magnetosphere, aerosol
research, space plasma and its physics &amp; chemistry, interstellar dust
and cosmic ray particles. A unique feature of the TIFR-BF is that it has
all aspects of Scientific Ballooning, i.e., Balloon Design, Fabrication,
Payload Integration with Telemetry, Telecommand and other instrumentation,
and finally Balloon Launch, Tracking, Data Collection, Balloon Flight
Control, as also Payload Recovery, under one roof. The balloon production
at the facility is completely indigenous, i.e. balloon material, load
tapes, end fittings, bonding tape have been developed in-house. In recent
times, the TIFR-BF also designed and fabricated a balloon with carrying
capacity of 3 tons with 4 layers of 25 microns, and also oblate spheroids
of volume ranging from 10 m 3 to 100 m 3 for testing of newly developed
satellite payloads in laboratory at different conditions. The balloon
flight support instrumentation at the TIFR-BF has been regularly updated
with several innovations and advanced instrumentation for safe and highly
reliable flights. A continuous improvement in balloon flight support
instrumentation by the Control Instrumentation Group to keep in pace with
the growing complexities of the scientific payloads have contributed to the
total success of balloon flights conducted recently. In this talk, I will
present the details of the above mentioned developments and the future upgr=
ade
plans.



*** NCU-Delta Colloquium ***

Speaker:    Dr Chao-Lin Kuo  (Stanford U.)
Date/Tim*e*:   June 14 (F), 14:00
Room:   NCU, S4 Room 1013
Title:     Gravitational Waves from Big Bang
Abstract:    Inflation is a compelling theory that describes the process of
Big Bang. Many predictions of the inflation theory have been confirmed by
observations of cosmic microwave background (CMB) over the last decade. A
most exciting, yet unobserved prediction of inflation is the production of
a scale-invariant gravitational wave background, which would leave a
distinct imprint of =E2=80=9CB-mode=E2=80=9D polarization in the CMB. I wil=
l describe the
physics behind this prediction, the ongoing effort to search for this
signal, and the outlook for the next decade.

Title:     Observational Signatures of Cloud-Cloud Collision in Galactic
Star-Forming Regions
Abstract:   The formation processes of massive OB stars and young stellar
clusters are still poorly understood. In recent years, the study of the
triggered star formation through the cloud-cloud collision (CCC) process
has become an interesting and important topic in the star formation
research. It has been suggested that the CCC process can form massive OB
stars and young stellar clusters at the junction of molecular clouds. The
onset of the CCC process in a given star-forming region could be
observationally inferred through the detection of a bridge feature
connecting the two clouds in velocity space, the broad CO line wing in the
intersection of the two clouds, and the complementary distribution of the
two colliding clouds. However, the investigation of observational
signatures of star formation (including massive stars) via the CCC
mechanism is still rare and very challenging. A multi-wavelength approach
has been effectively used as a promising observational tool for
understanding the ongoing physical processes in Galactic star-forming
regions. In this talk, new observational results of an analysis of some
promising Galactic star-forming regions will be presented, where the star
formation activities (including massive stars) appear to be influenced by
the CCC mechanism at the junction of molecular clouds.
