Speaker:        Miikka VÃ¤isÃ¤lÃ¤ (ASIAA)
Topic:          Basics of GPU programming with CUDA
Time:           3/25 (Monday) 12:15 - 13:15
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
GPUs have been rising in popularity in scientific computing, but what programming them actually involves? I will introduce you to the basic practical methods of GPU programming using Nvidia CUDA API - with some reflections on the lessons learned during the continuing development of the Astaroth code for computing MHD problems with high-order finite differences.



*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:        Miho Ishigaki (Tohoku)
Topic:          Element production by supernovae across the cosmic time probed by metal-poor stars
Time:           3/27 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Supernova explosions have been a dominant contributor of metals in the Universe. Thanks to recent large spectroscopic surveys of metal-poor stars 
in our Milky Way Galaxy, unprecedentedly large data sets of
elemental abundances in the atmosphere of metal-poor, and thus likely very old, stars  are now available. Statistical properties of the measured elemental abundances have put useful constraints on nucleosynthetic yields of supernovae of different generations of stars. I would like to review what we can learn from comparison between observed elemental abundances in metal-poor stars and   
theoretical supernova yield models, including core-collapse supernovae
of the very first generation of stars and Type Ia supernovae of various progenitor metalicities. Prospects for future large spectroscopic surveys in the
outskirt of the Milky Way will also be discussed.

Second announcement:
----------------------

ALMA2019: Science Results and Cross-Facility Synergies
--------------------------------------------------------

Dear colleagues,

Registration has now opened for the next ALMA-wide science
conference, to be held from 14-18 October 2019 in Cagliari, Sardinia,
Italy.

The Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) is the world's
most sensitive facility for millimeter/submillimeter astronomical
observations, and will soon be fully operational in all of the
originally planned bands.  Since its first observations, ALMA has
routinely delivered groundbreaking scientific results that span nearly
all areas of astrophysics.

Following conferencences in Puerto Varas (Chile, 2012), Tokyo (Japan,
2014), and Indian Wells (USA, 2016), the ALMA partnership is
organizing the next ALMA Science Conference in Cagliari (Sardinia,
Italy) on October 14-18, 2019.

At the conference we expect to discuss the full breadth of ALMA
science, with special emphasis on results from the first rounds of
ALMA Large Programmes, the long baselines and high frequency
capabilities, the new Solar and VLBI modes, as well as the synergy
between ALMA and other observatories. Science topics will include all
fields of astronomy, from cosmology and galaxies in the distant
Universe, nearby galaxies and the Galactic Center, interstellar medium
and star formation in our Galaxy, astrochemistry, circumstellar disks,
exoplanets, solar system, stellar evolution, and the Sun.

As in previous editions of the conference series, we expect to discuss
the scientific priorities for the implementation of the ALMA
Development Roadmap.
