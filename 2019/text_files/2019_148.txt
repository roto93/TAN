Topic:         Dusty mass-loss from evolved stars
Time:         9/18 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:          R1203
Abstract: Evolved Stars play key roles, enriching galaxies with dust, gas that fuels star
formation and the products of nucleosynthesis through their mass loss.For low- and
intermediate-mass stars, a large part of this mass loss occurs on the Asymptotic Giant
Branch through a dusty wind, while the more massive Red Supergiants undergo similar
processes. In this talk, I will review some recent progress in understanding the mechanisms
driving this mass loss and how it enriches the ISM. I will then present some results from the
ongoing JCMT large program the Nearby Evolved Stars Survey, which is observing a
statistical sample of evolved stars in the Solar Neighbourhood. NESS aims to determine the
total mass return to the Solar Neighbourhood and obtain a statistical picture of the physics
of mass loss. Finally, I will explore some important avenues for future work in this field.
