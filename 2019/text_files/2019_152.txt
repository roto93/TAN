*** ASIAA/NTU Joint Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________
Speaker:    Richard Ellis (UCL)
Topic:         Cosmic Dawn: The Observational Quest for the First Galaxies
Time:         9/24 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:          CCMS R104
Abstract:
The birth of galaxies represents the last unexplored frontier of cosmic history and it is commonly believed such early systems led to the transformation of neutral gas in the intergalactic medium into its present fully-ionised state. Some progress has been made in charting the demographics of early galaxies into the era when reionisation is thought to occur, but little is known about the nature of their stellar populations, the possible role of active nuclei and whether galaxies are capable of generating sufficient ionising radiation. Spectroscopy holds the key to addressing these questions, targeting both individual sources at high redshift as well as carefully-chosen analogues at intermediate redshift. I will describe the recent progress and challenges as we anticipate the launch of the James Webb Space Telescope and the arrival of next-generation large telescopes.


*** Colloquium ***

Speaker:    Richard Ellis (UCL)
Topic:         The Remarkable Assembly History of Elliptical Galaxies
Time:         9/25 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:          R1203
Abstract:
Once considered the simplest morphological class with smooth surface brightness profiles and homogenous old stellar populations, elliptical galaxies continue to reveal surprises.
I will present the results of several comprehensive spectroscopic campaigns of what are
considered to be the precursors of present-day ellipticals seen at redshifts up to and beyond 2. Good signal to noise absorption line spectra are capable of probing the stellar kinematics and stellar populations in early examples providing valuable insight into the assembly history of passive galaxies. I will discuss several puzzles that have emerged from such data including how the compact precursors (or `red nuggetsâ€™) grew in physical size but hardly in stellar mass, and why early massive examples display rapidly rotating stellar disks in contrast with local examples.
