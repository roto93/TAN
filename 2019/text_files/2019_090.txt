Speaker:        Ue-Li Pen (CITA)
Topic:          Probing cosmic initial conditions with galaxy spin vectors
Time:           6/3 (Monday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Disk galaxies exhibit prominent rotation axis. We present recent results to predict the spin vector of galaxies.  Previously, the sign of the spin vector was thought random, with the direction correlated along the primordial tidal field.  New numerical studies show how the initial inertia tensor can be predicted, enabling the use of the signed galaxy spin vector field to probe the early universe, including effects of neutrinos, and testing cosmic parity violation. We discuss observables and future prospects.

Topic:          The Dynamical Evolution of Newborn Triple Systems
Time:           6/6 (Thursday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Observational evidence increasingly supports that most, if not all, stars are formed in small multiple systems, which through internal instabilities and external perturbations decay to produce the separation distribution function and multiplicity statistics of the field. I will summarize observations of newborn stars that document their enhanced multiplicity fraction and discuss them in terms of dynamical evolution during the earliest evolutionary stages based on extensive numerical simulations.  Various poorly understood phenomena in early stellar evolution find an explanation as a result of the dynamical evolution of multiple systems, including Herbig-Haro jets and FU Orionis eruptions, as well as the formation of spectroscopic binaries and the widest binaries.
