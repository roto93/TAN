First announcement:
===================

ALMA2019: Science Results and Cross-Facility Synergies
======================================================

Dear colleagues,

It is our pleasure to announce the next ALMA-wide science conference, to be held from 14-18 October 2019 in Cagliari, Sardinia, Italy.

The Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) is the world's most sensitive facility for millimeter/submillimeter astronomical observations, and will soon be fully operational in all of the originally planned bands.  Since its first observations, ALMA has routinely delivered groundbreaking scientific results that span nearly all areas of astrophysics.

Following conferencences in Puerto Varas (Chile, 2012), Tokyo (Japan, 2014), and Indian Wells (USA, 2016), the ALMA partnership is organizing the next ALMA Science Conference in Cagliari (Sardinia, Italy) on October 14-18, 2019.

At the conference we expect to discuss the full breadth of ALMA science, with special emphasis on results from the first rounds of ALMA Large Programmes, the long baselines and high frequency capabilities, the new Solar and VLBI modes,  as well as the synergy between ALMA and other observatories.

As in previous editions of the conference series, we expect to discuss the scientific priorities for the implementation of the ALMA Development Roadmap.
