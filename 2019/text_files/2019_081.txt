ALMA2019: Science Results and Cross-Facility Synergies
-----------------------------------------------------------

Dear colleagues,

Registration has now opened for the next ALMA-wide science conference, 
to be held from 14-18 October 2019 in Cagliari, Sardinia, Italy. 
The abstract submission deadline is 15 May 2019.

At the conference we will discuss the full breadth of ALMA science, with 
special emphasis on results from the first rounds of ALMA Large Programmes, 
the long baselines and high frequency capabilities, the new Solar and 
VLBI modes, as well as the synergy between ALMA and other observatories. 
As in previous editions of the conference series, we expect to discuss 
the scientific priorities for the implementation of the ALMA Development 
Roadmap.

Information on the registration procedure, invited speakers, child care 
and financial support can be found on the conference website 
(https://indico.ict.inaf.it/event/789/overview).

Important dates:
++++++++++++++++
Registration opened: 13 March 2019
Abstract submission deadline: 15 May 2019
Deadline to request financial support: 15 May 2019
Notification of talk selection: 1 July 2019
Regular registration deadline: 31 July 2019
Late registration deadline: 13 September 2019

*** NCU Colloquium ***

*Speaker*:    Dr Peter Scicluna (ASIAA)
*Date/Time*:   May 10 (F), 14:00
*Room*:   NCU, S4 Room 1013
*Title*:    Hayabusa2 and JAXA small body exploration program
*Abstrac*t:    Outflows of evolved stars drive the chemical evolution of
galaxies in the local Universe. Population models dictate that low- to
intermediate-mass asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars dominate this process
today, while in the early universe, massive stars and supernovae were
likely the main contributors. However, many key issues regarding AGB mass
loss remain unresolved. Thanks to Spitzer, a number of Local Group galaxies
have been observed in detail, revealing the dust-production rates of all
evolved stars, and hence the total dust injection rate for the galaxies.
However, measuring the gas mass-loss rates outside our galaxy is
prohibitive, making it unlikely that a large sample will be available in
the foreseeable future, and systematic studies in the Milky Way remain
conspicuously absent. The Nearby Evolved Stars Survey (NESS) aims to fill
this gap, by targeting a volume-limited sample of roughly 400 sources
within 2 kpc, enabling robust statistical studies of local evolved stars.
We will derive the dust and gas return rates in the Solar Neighbourhood,
and constrain the physics underlying these processes. I will present a
detailed description of the project, including the motivation and strategy,
and highlight some of our early results. I will also briefly introduce the
tools we are developing that will, along with a catalogue containing all
raw and reduced NESS data and a compilation of literature data, be released
to the community to aid reproducibility.

> To: astro@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw, asall <asall@astro.ncu.edu.tw>

There will be a conference on astronomical telescopes
and instruments, to be held September 2 to 5 in
Kaohsiung.  The eighth in the series, held once every two years and
alternating between Taiwan and China, this meeting aims to bring together
scientists and engineers to keep breast of the ongoing developments of
observing facilities and latest technological advancements.  Over the years
the meeting serves as an effective vehicle to foster
collaboration with Chinese astronomers.

The meeting will be run in Mandarin Chinese, but speakers could choose to
present in English.

*** NCU Colloquium ***

*Speaker*:    Dr Hsi-Yu Schive (NTU)
*Date/Time*:   May 24 (F), 14:00
*Room*:   NCU, S4 Room 1013
*Title*:     Wave Dark Matter Predictions from GPU-accelerated Adaptive Mes=
h
*Abstrac*t:    The conventional particle interpretation of cold dark matter
(CDM) still lacks laboratory support and struggles to explain the basic
properties of low-mass galaxies. This tension motivates wave dark matter (=
=CF=88DM)
composed of extremely light particles (m=CF=88~10-22 eV), which suppresses
structure below the kpc scale by the uncertainty principle but retains the
large-scale structure predicted by CDM. In the first part of this talk, I
will present cosmological =CF=88DM simulations with extremely high resoluti=
on
capable of resolving dwarf galaxies, revealing that every =CF=88DM halo has=
 a
prominent soliton core surrounded by fluctuating density granules. These
predictions are consistent with the observations of galaxy formation,
Lyman-alpha forest, reionization, and gravitational lensing flux anomalies.
I will also discuss several critical challenges faced by this model. The
second part of this talk will focus on GAMER, a GPU-accelerated adaptive
mesh refinement (AMR) code developed from scratch by our group. A rich set
of physics modules have been incorporated and which outperforms other AMR
codes by one to two orders of magnitude. The code scales well to thousands
of GPUs and achieves a uniform resolution as high as 10,2403 cells. I will
present several ongoing astrophysical projects using GAMER that require
substantially higher resolution than previously feasible.
