Speaker:        Meng-Ru Wu (ASIOP)
Topic:          Finding the remnants of the Milky Way's last neutron star mergers
Time:           7/22 (Monday) 12:15 - 13:15
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
The discovery of a binary neutron star merger (NSM) through both its gravitational wave and electromagnetic emission has revealed these events to be key sites of r-process nucleosynthesis. However, whether NSMs are truly the dominant sites producing r-process elements to account for the measured abundances in the solar system and in metal-poor stars, and what isotopes do NSMs exactly produce are still undergoing debates. In this talk, I will discuss our recent work which demonstrates that it can be possible to detect the nuclear decay gamma-ray lines from the last ~O(10) NSM remnants in the Milky Way, if the next-generation gamma-ray telescopes can reach a line-sensitivity down to ~ 10^-8 to 10^-6 photons per centimeter square per second. I will also discuss possible implications from such detection to the above debating issues.


*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________
Speaker:        Cheng Li (Tsinghua University, Beijing)
Topic:          Mapping the stars, gas and dust in nearby galaxies
Time:           7/24 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
The cosmic star formation rate density has been declining since z~2-3, suggesting that the cessation of star formation has been the dominating process in galaxy evolution since then. However, it is unclear how the star formation gets quenched inside the galaxies and what physical mechanisms have been driving this process. Current  integral field unit (IFU) surveys such as CALIFA and MaNGA are providing  resolved spectroscopy for large samples of galaxies in the local Universe, allowing the star formation histories across the whole galaxy area to be  studied with high accuracy. In addition, maps of molecular gas are also being obtained by arrays of radio antenna, thus providing additional data for linking the star formation and gas accretion processes in the IFU era. I'll talk about our recent work based on the CALIFA, MaNGA and CARMA-EDGE surveys, particularly focusing on the roles of environmental effect and internal structure in driving galaxy evolution.
