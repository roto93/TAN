Call for Proposals 2019B (KVN VLBI)

--------------------------------------

The Korean VLBI Network (KVN) invites proposals for open-use VLBI
observations during the 2019B season. Observations of successful proposals
will be scheduled between 16th August 2019 and 15th January 2020. Proposals
should be submitted to the KVN website (https://kvn.kasi.re.kr) before the
deadline of 3 June 2019, UT 08:00 (KST 17:00).


 Korean VLBI Network (KVN)

The Korean VLBI Network (KVN) is a dedicated mm-VLBI network, operated by
the Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute (KASI, http://www.kasi.re.kr).
Its three 21m radio telescopes are located around South Korea in Seoul,
Ulsan, and Jeju Island. The baseline length ranges from 305 km to 476 km
and its 4-channel receiving system allows simultaneous observation at 22,
43, 86, and 129 GHz. Higher than 1 Gbps recording rates (e.g., 2, 4 and 8
Gbps) using Mark6 recorder are also available. Total time of 300 hours is
allocated for the 2019B season. The maximum observation time for a proposal
is limited to 100 hours. If requested, the observation time can allocated
over a year until 15th June 2020, however, the total observation time is
still limited to 100 hours even in this case. Details of information and
current status of the KVN can be found in the KVN VLBI Status Report (
https://radio.kasi.re.kr/kvn/status_report_2019/array.html).


Proposers should use the KVN VLBI observing application form which is
available at the KVN website. Please carefully follow the instructions of
the proposal form. A separate scientific and technical justification is
mandatory. This Justification should be submitted together with the
proposal form and not exceed 3 pages.
