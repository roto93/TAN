Dear colleagues,

This e-mail is to announce 'Call for Proposals (CfP) for the East
Asian VLBI Network (EAVN)' for the 2020A semester. From the 2020A
semester, CfP for the KVN and VERA Array (KaVA) is merged into the
EAVN CfP. Please refer to the following EAVN website for more details
about the array's specification, available observation modes, and
how to submit proposals.

Best regards,

Kiyoaki Wajima
(KASI; in place of EAVN directors)

***************************************************
Call for Proposals for the East Asian VLBI Network (EAVN)
for the 2020A semester
Proposal submission deadline: 15th November, 2019, 8:00 UT
***************************************************

*** Overview ***
We invite proposals for open-use observations with the East Asian VLBI
Network (EAVN), which is the international collaborative VLBI array
between China, Korea, and Japan. In the 2020A semester, 11 telescopes
(VERA 4 x 20 m, KVN 3 x 21 m, Nobeyama 45 m, Takahagi 32 m, Tianma 65 m,
and Nanshan 26 m) participate in the EAVN open-use program. From the
2020A semester, proposal submission of the KVN and VERA Array (KaVA;
7-telescope array with KVN and VERA) is integrated with that of EAVN.


*** Observing mode ***
EAVN provides an opportunity of VLBI observations with a data recording
rate of 1 Gbps (total bandwidth of 256 MHz and with single polarization
(LHCP) at 22 and 43 GHz. We also support various observing modes such
as 'astrometry mode' and 'hybrid mode' for part of EAVN telescopes.
Please refer to the EAVN status report on the EAVN website for more
details.


*** Telescope time ***
The total available observation time for EAVN is up to 500 hours in
the 2020A semester, while the available observing time for each EAVN
telescope is different. All EAVN observations will be scheduled between
11th January and 10th June 2020. Please refer to the EAVN status report
on the EAVN website for more details.

EAVN accepts a request of usage of sub-array configuration (KaVA 7
telescopes and additional telescopes from non-KaVA stations), as well
as EAVN full array configuration.

The maximum observation time for a single EAVN proposal is limited to
150 hours in case of usage of only KaVA, while one can request for the
maximum total observation time of 60 hours for Tianma and Nanshan for
a single proposal, and that of 24 hours for Nobeyama and Takahagi. If
requested, the observation time can be allocated over a year until 10th
January 2021, however the total observation time is still limited to
150 hours even in this case.


*** Target of opportunity ***
EAVN accepts target of opportunity (ToO) proposals, while Nobeyama and
Takahagi cannot be included for ToO proposals. It is strongly recommended
that ToO proposals (especially expected ToO) are submitted during the
regular CfP. Unexpected or urgent ToO can be submitted as Director's
Discretionary Time (DDT) proposals at any time. ToO proposals must
include clear triggering criteria to initiate an observation. ToOs
are valid for one year after it is approved. ToO proposals for DDT
should follow the same format of regular call and should be sent to
eavnprop(at mark)kasi.re.kr.


*** Proposal submission ***
Proposals should be submitted via EAVN website. Proposal submission
deadline is 15th November 2019, 8:00 UT. Please refer to the EAVN
status report for detailed information about the proposal format. The
designated coversheet form can be downloaded via the EAVN websites.


*** EAVN website ***
Please refer to the following EAVN website for more information about
the array capabilities and detailed conditions for proposal submission.

Call for Proposals 2020A (KVN VLBI)

    Proposal submission deadline:

   15th November, 2019, 08:00 UT

--------------------------------------


The Korean VLBI Network (KVN) invites scientific proposals for VLBI
observations during the 2020A season from astronomers around the world.
Observations of successful proposals will be scheduled between 15th January
2020 and 15th June 2020. Proposals should be submitted via the KVN website (
http://kvn.kasi.re.kr) before the deadline of UT 08:00 on 15th November
2019.


** Korean VLBI Network (KVN) **

The Korean VLBI Network (KVN) is a dedicated mm-VLBI network, operated by
the Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute (KASI, http://www.kasi.re.kr).
Its three 21m radio telescopes are located around South Korea in Seoul,
Ulsan, and Jeju Island. The baseline length ranges from 305km to 476 km.
Its 4-channel receiving system allows simultaneous observation at 22, 43,
86, and 129 GHz. Higher than 1 Gbps recording rates (2, 4 and 8 Gbps) using
Mark6 recorder are available. Total time of 300 hours are planned for this
call. The maximum observation time of a proposal is limited to 100 hours.
If requested in the proposals, the observation time can be allocated over a
year, until January 15, 2021, but the observation time will not be
increased. Details of the information and current status of the KVN can be
found in the KVN VLBI Status Report (
https://radio.kasi.re.kr/kvn/status_report_2019/array.html).


Proposers should use the KVN VLBI observing application form available at
the KVN website. Please carefully follow the instructions of the proposal
form. A separate scientific and technical justification is mandatory. This
Justification should be submitted together with the proposal form and not
exceed 3 pages.

Subject: First announcement of EAYAM 2020
To: Taiwan Astronomy Network <astro@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw>

The East Asian Young Astronomers Meeting (EAYAM) was first organized in
2003 to promote interaction and collaboration between young astronomers in
East Asia. The success of the initial meeting in Taiwan was followed by
EAYAM 2006 in Japan, EAYAM 2008 in China, EAYAM 2011 in Korea, EAYAM 2015
in Taiwan, and EAYAM 2017 in Japan. We are pleased to announce that EAYAM
2020 will once again be held in China, between May. 17-21, 2020, at the
National Astronomy Observatory of China (NAOC), Chinese Academy of Sciences
(CAS) in Beijing.

The main goal of the meeting is to bring young astronomers together,
encouraging them to present recent research, form new collaborations, and
exchange their experiences of an early-stage science career. Graduate
students and postdocs are encouraged to participate -- especially those who
are either originally from, or currently work in the East Asia region. All
participants are expected to give either an oral or a poster presentation
to stimulate discussion and interaction. Following the abstract submission
deadline (Feb. 15, 2020), the SOC will select the oral presentations for
the final program. All of those who are not granted their preferred oral
presentation will be allowed a poster contribution.

There is no conference registration fee. To register and submit an
abstract, please visit following website
