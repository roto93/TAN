It is our great pleasure and honor to invite you to participate in the
APCTP School/Workshop on Gravitational-Wave Cosmology which will be held
on November 30 to December 4, 2019 in Taipei, Taiwan.

The School/Workshop website:
https://www.phys.sinica.edu.tw/~gwc19/index.php

The school/workshop is an event of the APCTP cooperative external
activity program. The school/workshop will concentrate on gravitational
waves generated from inflation and other cosmological processes, as well
as from compact binary mergers, and on their potential detections in
cosmic microwave background B-polarization experiments and
ground-based/space-borne gravity-wave detectors, as well as using
gravitational-wave sources to do cosmological measurements.

The main purpose of the school/workshop is to provide a good opportunity
for young scientists, master and PhD students coming from universities
and institutes in the Asia-Pacific region to develop regional exchange
activities, mutual understanding and cooperation, as well as stimulate
scientific training and education.

The School/Workshop will support students' travel expenses.

        * Cosmological perturbations in inflation and expanding universe
        * Astrophysical and cosmological gravity-wave sources
        * Black-hole and neutron-star mergers
        * Primordial black holes
        * Detection of gravitational waves and data pipeline
        * Standard sirens and the latest results from LIGO-Virgo
        * Tests of gravity and constraints on modified theories of gravity
        * Cosmic microwave background B-mode polarization
