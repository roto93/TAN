Arizona Radio Observatory: Call for Proposals (2019A)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Astrophysicists and Astronomers of Taiwan,

The Arizona Radio Observatory (ARO) solicits observing proposals for the ALMA Prototype 12-meter Telescope (12m) located on Kitt Peak, Arizona, and for the 10-meter Submillimeter Telescope (SMT) located on Mount Graham, Arizona, for the period February 15, 2019 - June 15, 2019. Proposal candidates from members of the University Consortium of ALMA-Taiwan (UCAT) and ASIAA should submit up to THREE pages of scientific and technical justification (including figures, tables, and references) in addition to their Proposal Summary Sheet (download form here):
https://www.as.arizona.edu/sites/default/files/ARO_Proposal_Cover_Sheet.pdf

All proposal candidates are required to list on the Proposal Summary Sheet their requested observing blocks (the exact LST ranges to be scheduled and number of times to be repeated), dates on which they are NOT available to observe, and dates in which sources in those observing blocks are within the Sun-avoidance zone (45 degrees at the SMT, 10 degrees at the 12m).

The 12m ALMA Prototype antenna currently supports an ALMA Band 3 (82.5-116 GHz) dual-polarization SBS (sideband-separating) receiver.  The 12m control system supports dual-polarization in the same sideband or single-polarization in each sideband ("2 IF mode"), position-switched, beam-switched, and OTF observations.  The new AROWS spectrometer is the recommended backend for 12m observations.  The MAC is available as a backup; the Filterbanks are being decommissioned during the 2019A semester. Possible backend modes may be found on the ARO Equipment Summary and Status sheet at: https://www.as.arizona.edu/arizona-radio-observatory 

The 10m SMT currently supports a dual-polarization ALMA Band 6 (211-280 GHz) receiver with SBS mixers.  Higher frequency receivers will not be available this semester.  The SMT control system supports both dual-polarization ("2 IF mode") and dual-polarization+dual-sideband observations ("4 IF mode") with tunable IF from 4.5-7.5 GHz, for position-switched, beam-switched, and OTF observations.  Proposal candidates should consult the ARO Equipment Summary and Status sheet for additional technical specifications at https://www.as.arizona.edu/arizona-radio-observatory . 

Remote observing is available. Observers who plan to observe remotely must supply fixed IP address(es) of the computer(s) that will be used during observing on their Proposal Summary Sheet. For further information about remote observing and other operational questions, please contact Tom Folkers, ARO Software Engineer: tfolkers@email.arizona.edu .

Scheduling of successful proposals will be done according to availability of the receivers requested.  Graduate student participation is especially encouraged. Proposals should be emailed in PDF format to kuan[at]asiaa.sinica.edu.tw by midnight (23:59 CST) January 21, 2019 (Monday).

Topic:          Searching for Tidal Disruption Events in the Optical Time Domain (Hung) / Searching the OSSOS dataset for unusual objects: slow movers and interlopers (Ashton)
Time:           1/7 (Monday) 12:15 - 13:15
Place:           R1203
Abstract:

Ashton:
This talk combines two projects that uses the Outer Solar System Origins Survey (OSSOS) dataset to search for unusual small bodies. The first search looked for objects beyond 300 au using an uncommon search technique, we use an algorithm to identify objects that appear stationary on the timescale of hours but not present days/weeks/months before and after. After visually scanning all the candidates no slow moving objects were discovered. From the null detection and using a survey simulator, we obtain a model-dependent 95% upper limit of 1000 on the number of `planetary objects', with absolute magnitudes in the range -3 < H < 2, in the distant Solar System. In the second search we looked for interstellar objects (IS0s) using a slightly altered version of the TNO detection software used by OSSOS. No ISOs were discovered. However, we have found bound objects traveling at motions (when observed only over short arcs) that an ISO in the outer Solar System could have, and we show h!
 ow previous moving-object surveys may have detected ISOs but incorrectly assigned them to bound orbits.



*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:        Kenji Kurosaki (Nagoya University)
Topic:          Thermal Evolution and Obliquity of Solar System Ice giants
Time:           1/9 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Our solar system has two ice giants, Uranus and Neptune. The
intrinsic luminosity and the obliquity are different between Uranus and Neptune, though they have similar mass and radius. In particular, Uranus has a tilted rotation axis, which is supposed to be caused by a giant impact. In general, an impact event also changes the internal compositional distribution and drives mass ejection from the planet. The present luminosity of a planet infers not only the present atmospheric composition but also the origin of the accretion energy that the planet gained during its formation and impact event. I will talk thethermal evolution history and the impact event that reproduces the present Uranusâ€™s intrinsic luminosity and obliquity.
We demonstrate that the latent heat of those species keeps the
atmosphere hot and thus the emission flux high for billions of years, resulting in
acceleration of the cooling of ice giants. Also, we find that young ice giants with
highly enriched atmospheres are much brighter in mid-infrared than those with
unenriched atmospheres. This provides important implication for future direct
imaging of extrasolar ice giants. We also perform hydrodynamics simulations for the impact events of Uranus-size ice giants composed of a water core surrounded by a hydrogen envelope using two variant methods of the smoothed particle hydrodynamics. We suggest the range of possible initial conditions for the giant impact on proto-Uranus that reproduces the present rotation tilt of Uranus and sufficiently provides the total angular momentum of the satellite system that can be created from the fragments from the giant impact.
