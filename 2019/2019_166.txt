--------------------------------------


The Korean VLBI Network (KVN) invites scientific proposals for VLBI
observations during the 2020A season from astronomers around the world.
Observations of successful proposals will be scheduled between 15th January
2020 and 15th June 2020. Proposals should be submitted via the KVN website (

** Korean VLBI Network (KVN) **

The Korean VLBI Network (KVN) is a dedicated mm-VLBI network, operated by
the Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute (KASI, http://www.kasi.re.kr).
Its three 21m radio telescopes are located around South Korea in Seoul,
Ulsan, and Jeju Island. The baseline length ranges from 305km to 476 km.
Its 4-channel receiving system allows simultaneous observation at 22, 43,
86, and 129 GHz. Higher than 1 Gbps recording rates (2, 4 and 8 Gbps) using
Mark6 recorder are available. Total time of 300 hours are planned for this
call. The maximum observation time of a proposal is limited to 100 hours.
If requested in the proposals, the observation time can be allocated over a
year, until January 15, 2021, but the observation time will not be
increased. Details of the information and current status of the KVN can be
found in the KVN VLBI Status Report (
https://radio.kasi.re.kr/kvn/status_report_2019/array.html).


Proposers should use the KVN VLBI observing application form available at
the KVN website. Please carefully follow the instructions of the proposal
form. A separate scientific and technical justification is mandatory. This
Justification should be submitted together with the proposal form and not
exceed 3 pages.
