Topic:          First direct observational evidence for sub-sonic nature of gas sloshing in a cool core of galaxy cluster
Time:           3/4 (Monday) 12:15 - 13:15
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Galaxy clusters are the largest gravitaionally bound and virialized objects in the Universe. They are continuously growing through mergers between smaller galaxy clusters. RXJ 1347.5 - 1145 (z = 0.451) is one of the most luminous X-ray galaxy clusters, which means that this cluster is one of the most massive galaxy clusters. Our team carried out the ALMA observation of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZE) on this cluster. This observation enable us to look into the SZE image of the core of galaxy clusters owing to the angular resolution of ALMA. Combining the high-resolution data of Chandra X-ray, we find that the residual X-ray image after removing the global emission shows a clear dipolar pattern characteristic of gas sloshing,
whereas we find no significant residual in the SZE image. We then estimate the equation of state of perturbations in the gas from the X-ray and SZE residual images. The inferred velocity is 420 +310/-420  km/s, which is much lower than the adiabatic sound speed of the intracluster medium in the core. We thus conclude that the perturbation is nearly isobaric, and the gas sloshing motion is consistent with being in pressure equilibrium. I will present this result and mention about the other feature in the X-ray and the SZE images of RXJ 1347.5 - 1145.

Topic:          Simulating Protoplanetary Disks Using GPU
Time:           3/4 (Monday) 11:00 - 12:00
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Protoplanetary disks are gas-rich disks around young stars, and cradles
of planets. Observations of these disks have revealed that they are all
rich in features, containing gaps and spiral arms that are potentially
the results of gravitational disk-planet interaction. Using
hydrodynamics simulations, we can study them and probe the early stages
of planet formation. However, these simulations have stringent
requirements on both resolution and duration, and their significant
computational cost has been a bottleneck in research. In this talk, I
will discuss how we are able to lower this cost by an order of
magnitude by adapting to GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) computing. I
will describe my GPU-based hydrodynamics code PEnGUIn, and explain the
optimization that helps it reach a speed of about 100 million cells per
second per GPU. I will present results from PEnGUIn simulations, where
we not only model specific disks in detail, but also perform parameter
space studies to provide quantitative links between disk features and
the properties of potential planets. I will discuss how these results
have informed us about planet formation, tying back to the known
population of exoplanets. In the end, I will also give a few examples
of other board applications of GPU computing in astronomical research.

Topic:          Multi-wavelength Astronomy and the Origin of Planetary Systems
Time:           3/5 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
One of the most exciting developments in astronomy is the
discovery of planets around stars other than our Sun.  More than two
thousand exo-planets have now been detected.  But how do these planets form,
and why are they so different from those in our own solar system?  Which
ingredients are available to build them?  Thanks to powerful ground-based
telescopes such as the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) and soon the
James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), we are now in a position to address these age-old questions scientifically.  The formation of stars and planetary
systems takes place in "molecular clouds".  These dense, cold, dust
enshrouded regions of the interstellar medium exhibit a high degree of
molecular complexity.  I will discuss how this complexity develops in
protostellar envelopes, and how far it progresses before the molecules are
incorporated as ices into planetesimals in protoplanetary disks and
delivered to planets in the habitable zone.

Topic:          A journey to the Earth and icy bodiesâ€™ interiors
Time:           3/6 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Physical properties of constituent materials in the Earth and planetary interiors are key to determine their formation history and thermo-chemical structures, etc. In particular, knowledge of the thermal conductivity of these constituent materials under relevant pressure-temperature conditions plays critical roles in understanding many geophysical phenomena within the Earth and planetary bodies, such as the temperature profile and dynamics of the mantle and core, as well as the heat flux across the core-mantle boundary. Recently we have successfully combined ultrafast optics with high pressure diamond cells to precisely measure lattice thermal conductivity of Earthâ€™s mantle and core materials and water-volatile mixtures under extreme conditions. Modeling of our new data show significant influences of hydration, iron, aluminum, and volatiles on the thermal states and dynamics of the Earth and icy bodies. I will also discuss some future directions that are important to furth!
 er understand the thermal history of the Earth and icy bodies.

Topic:          Optical Developments for WIFIS and Subaru PFS Projects
Time:           3/6 (Wednesday) 11:00 - 12:00
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
My expertise is in optical design as well as follow up developments such as performance simulation, optics fabrication details, instrument integration and testing, etc. My instrumentation experience includes the development of a Wide Integral Field Infrared Spectrograph (WIFIS), the development for the Subaru Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS), and the development of a star tracker camera system. WIFIS is the largest Etendue (AÎ©) near-infrared integral field spectrograph recently commissioned on Bok telescope at Kitt Peak in 2017. I was in charge of the optical design of WIFIS and optics fabrication details. For PFS project, my main contribution is on the fiber probes and one of the sub-system called Metrology Camera System (MCS). The fiber probe is designed to measure the fiber status (tilt, shift and focus). The fiber probe is built by myself and characterized to satisfy all system requirements. Currently the fiber probe has been installed on the instrument calibration stand !
 and taking data. On the other hand, MCS is designed to provide accurate fiber position information by taking images of back illuminated fibers. The MCS optical design, optics fabrications and performance simulations were completed by myself. Currently MCS has been integrated and shipped to Subaru observatory in 2018. In the engineering runs in late Oct. 2018, MCS demonstrated its capability to successfully take images of objects located at the telescope prime focal plane. Besides that, I will present my work in the optical design and performance tests of a star tracker camera system that will be used on a micro-satellite. For future developments, in the near future I will coordinate with group engineers to accomplish the installation and status verification of PFS fiber modules. For MCS project, I will keep improving the MCS image quality and the goal is to deliver MCS to Subaru observatory in 2019. For longer time scale developments, I will describe my work in ULTIMATE-Sub!
 aru and present potential optical developments for Subaru tele!
 scope and TMT first light instrument MOBIE.
