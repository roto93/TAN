> Dear all,

> Observing proposals for the 45-m telescope of Nobeyama Radio =
Observatory=20
> (38th observing period) are invited.

> Ken'ichi Tatematsu
> Director
> Nobeyama Radio Observatory, NAOJ
> -----------

> 1. Open use Period
> -  December 2, 2019 to April 24, 2020

> https://www.nro.nao.ac.jp/~nro45mrt/html/index-e.html

> - One deadline will be offered.
> - We accept only proposals for Regular, Large and GTO Programs.
> - The continuum mode for science target observation will not be =
offered.
> - The observation support remotely from Nobeyama only during =
9:00-17:00 JST, Monday through Friday (including national holidays).
> - All observers are basically carried out through remote observations =
from NAOJ Mitaka, ASIAA in Taiwan and KASI in Korea, and =

spreadsheets.

> 5. Evaluation:
> - Proposals in the category of Regular, Large and GTO are evaluated by =
anonymous referees, and the acceptance is judged by the millimeter and =
submillimeter time allocation committee.

> 6. Time allocation:
> 45-m observational time will be allocated by the Nobeyama Radio =
observatory for proposals accepted by the millimeter and submillimeter =
time allocation committee.

> 7. Questions?
> Any questions about observations and preparations of proposals should =
be submitted through the helpdesk:
