Dear all,

We will have a conference titled
'Future Science with Multi-Wavelength Data: NEP meeting 2019'
on 24-26 June at NTHU.

We would like to announce that the conference website is now open
(https://seongini.wixsite.com/nepconf2). Please visit the registration
page and make sure to register first!

The science on the NEP field with the AKARI space telescope is turning
into a new era.Â  Currently, our deep HSC imaging data covering the entire
NEP-Wide field has become available. The SCUBA2 survey program to
cover the same area is still going on.Â  A collaboration to carry out a 
massive
spectroscopic survey using the new Subaru/PFS is also on-going. From the
space,Â  Euclid, SPHEREx, and eROSTA will cover the field in near-IR and
X-ray.

The AKARI's NEP legacy will remain the only survey having continuous
mid-IR bands data over 5 sq. deg.Â  This legacy will continue to grow with
a lot more multi-wavelength data.Â  Time is ripe for top scientists to meet
again to pave the bright future of the NEP field science. We are looking
forward to seeing you here, in Hsinchu!

Best Regards,
Seong-Jin,Â  on behalf of LOC.
