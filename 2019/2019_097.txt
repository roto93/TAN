Topic:         Velocity-aligned stacked spectra of 13CO, C18O and CN to determine stellar masses in Lupus
Time:         6/17 (Monday) 12:15 - 13:15
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
The spectroscopic measurement of stellar mass using stellar evolutionary models is considered reliable for main-sequence stars, but shows significant deviations for pre-main-sequence stars when using different models, due to different underlying assumptions in the models. The aim of our work is to obtain stellar mass measurements of young stellar objects, independent from evolutionary models, with a method based on the Keplerian rotation in circumstellar disks, and compare these against the spectroscopically determined stellar masses. Our method uses the Keplerian velocity pattern in a protoplanetary disk to align its molecular line spectra at different positions in the disk and stack them. The enhanced S/N ratio in the resulting stacked spectrum allows measurements of the rotational velocity to derive the stellar mass even for faint sources with short integration time. We analysed the 13CO, C18O (2-1) and (3-2) and CN data of 32 young stars in the Lupus Clouds obtained with!
  ALMA with integration time of approximately one minute per source using this method. We obtained the mass of 31 stars and found that for a star in the mass range of 0.6 â‰¤ M* â‰¤ 1.2 Msun, the stellar mass tends to be underestimated by 20-50% using evolutionary models.
