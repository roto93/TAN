*** NCU Colloquium Talk ***

*by* Yen-Chen Pan
*on* Understanding Type Ia Supernova with UV Spectroscopy
*at*  Feb/15 (F) 14:00 - 15:00 NCU S4-1013
*Abstract* Ultraviolet (UV) observations of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are
useful tools for understanding progenitor systems and explosion physics. In
particular, UV spectra of SNe Ia, which probe the outermost layers, are
strongly affected by the progenitor metallicity. Theory suggests that SN Ia
progenitor metallicity is correlated with its peak luminosity, but not its
light-curve shape. This effect should lead to an increased Hubble scatter,
reducing the precision with which we measure distances. If the mean
progenitor metallicity changes with redshift, cosmological measurements
could be biased. Models also indicate that changing progenitor metallicity
will have little effect on the appearance of optical SN data, but
significantly alter UV spectra. To address this problem, we reduced and
published the largest UV spectroscopic sample of SNe Ia to date. With this
sample, we confirm theoretical predictions that SN Ia UV spectra are strong
metallicity indicators. Our findings show that UV spectra are promising
tools to further our understanding of SN Ia while directly improving the
utility of SN Ia for cosmology.

*on* Faint Submillimeter Galaxies
*at* Feb 22 (F) 14:00 to 15:00
*Abstract* Submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) are high-redshift dust obscured
star-forming galaxies with extremely high star formation rate (10^2 to
>10^3 Msun/yr). They are widely regarded as progenitors of present-day
massive elliptical galaxies. They were first discovered in the late 90=E2=
=80=99s.
Since then, we have slowly accumulated knowledge about this special
population of galaxies. In the first decade since their discovery, most
observations focused on the brightest members in this population, because
of the limited sensitivities of submillimeter instruments. Such bright SMGs
are extremely luminous, but are not representative in the dusty galaxy
population. Thanks to the advent of sensitive interferometers and
wide-field cameras, we are now pushing our studies to much fainter SMGs,
i.e., more typical members in the dusty galaxy population. In this talk, I
will introduce our recent works on understanding the faint SMGs and their
relationship to normal galaxies.

*on* The Microphysics of AGN Feedback
*at* Feb 25 (M) 4:00 pm (*special date/time*) NCU S4 Room 1013
*Abstract* Feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) is one of the most
important processes governing the formation and evolution of galaxies and
galaxy clusters. It is believed to be responsible for inhibiting the
formation of massive galaxies and for solving the long-standing
"cooling-flow problem" in galaxy clusters. A lot of understanding of AGN
feedback has been gained using hydrodynamic simulations; however, some of
the relevant physical processes are unresolvable or not captured by pure
hydrodynamics, such as plasma effects and cosmic-ray (CR) physics. In this
talk, I will present how we use simulations that incorporate this
"microphysics" to understand how AGN jets feedback on galactic and cluster
scales. Specifically, I will discuss our recent progress on the
understanding of AGN heating in clusters, and how the heating processes
depends on the AGN jet composition. I will also talk about how we could use
multi-messenger observations of the Fermi bubbles as a nearby laboratory
for studying AGN feedback. Finally, I will conclude with open questions and
future prospects of applying simulations beyond hydrodynamics to various
interesting astrophysical systems.
