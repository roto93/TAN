*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:        Fang-Chun Liu (NTNU)
Topic:          The physical and chemical structure of continuum sources in Orion KL
Time:           2/13 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Orion Kleinmannâ€“Low (Orion KL) hot molecular core, the nearest massive star-forming region to Earth, is one of the richest molecular reservoirs in Milky Way. With the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) high-angular resolution observations, we investigate the millimeter/submillimeter continuum emission of Orion KL. In this study, twenty-four separate continuum sources are identified. Moreover, the physical and chemical properties of each individual continuum, such as the velocity, temperature and mass, and chemical abundances of nitrogen-/oxygen-bearing molecules, are also inferred based on the continuum and spectral emission observed. Marked correlations between certain physical and chemical parameters thus derived are evident and may be attributed to different evolutionary stages in these continuum sources.


*** Special Seminar ***
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:        Yuan-Sen Ting (Carnegie / Princeton / IAS)
Topic:          Milky Way, machine learning, big data
Time:           2/14 (Thursday) 11:00 - 12:00
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Understanding physical processes responsible for the formation and
evolution of galaxies like the Milky Way is a fundamental but unsolved
problem in astrophysics. Fortunately, most stars are long-lived. As such,
using the stars as "fossil records" (what is known as Galactic archaeology)
can offer unparalleled insight into the assembly of galaxies.  In recent
years, the landscape of Galactic archaeology is rapidly changing thanks to
on-going large-scale surveys (astrometry, photometry, spectroscopy,
asteroseismology) which provide a few orders of magnitude more stars than
before. In this talk, I will discuss new "phenomenological" opportunities
enabled by large surveys.  I will also discuss how machine-learning tools
could leverage the big data about the Milky Way by maximally harnessing
information from low-resolution stellar spectra as well as the time-series
photometric fluxes of stars. I will also present the new opportunities in
Galactic archaeology in the era of deep photometry and spectroscopy, such
as LSST, HSC, and PFS.
