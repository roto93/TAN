Dear Yi-Jehng,

I would appreciate it if you could circulate the first announcement of =
the SMA=20
interferometry school to TAN.

Regards,
Naomi

-----------------

Dear Colleagues,


We are delighted to be releasing this First Announcement for the first =
Submillimeter Array Interferometry School.

The school will be held on January 12-17th 2020 in Hilo, on the Big =
Island of Hawai'i (conveniently following the Winter AAS Meeting in =
Honolulu), and is organized by the Center for Astrophysics, in =
conjunction with the Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and =
Astrophysics and the University of Hawaii. The goals of the school are =
to provide graduate students, postdocs and scientists outside the field =
with a broad knowledge of interferometry and data reduction techniques =
at (sub)millimeter wavelengths.

The workshop will provide a series of lectures on the fundamentals of =
radio interferometry with a special emphasis on observations at =
(sub)millimeter wavelengths. The school will extensively utilize the =
Submillimeter Array (SMA) on Mauna Kea, Hawaii and its new capabilities.=20=

We particularly stress the hands-on nature of this School, where =
participants will be able to experience actively performing observations =
and data reduction for their own proposed projects.

Further details and updates on the program and the logistics will be =
provided on the School=E2=80=99s website (www.cfa.harvard.edu/sma-school =
<http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/sma-school>, or email at =
sma-school@cfa.harvard.edu <mailto:sma-school@cfa.harvard.edu>) through =
a Second Announcement coinciding with the opening of registration in =
July. Stay tuned and, for now, save the date!
