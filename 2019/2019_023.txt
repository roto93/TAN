Abstract
In this talk I will present our new study on the interplay between magnetic
field, gravity, and turbulence in the fragmentation process of cores within
the filamentary infrared dark cloud G34.43.  We observe the magnetic field
(B) morphology across G34.43, traced with thermal dust polarization at 350
micron with an angular resolution of 10" (0.18 pc), and compare with the
kinematics obtained from N2H+ across the filament. We derive local velocity
gradients from N2H+, tracing motion in the plane of sky, and compare with
the observed local B field orientations in the plane of sky. The B field
orientations are found to be perpendicular to the long axis of the filament
toward the MM1 and MM2 ridge, suggesting that the B field can guide
material toward the filament.  Toward MM3, the B field orientations appear
more parallel to the filament and aligned with the elongated MM3 core,
hinting a different B field role. Besides a large-scale east-west velocity
gradient, we find a close alignment between local B field orientations and
local velocity gradients toward the MM1/MM2 ridge. This local correlation
in alignment supports a scenario where gas motions and B field lines are
intertwined. Additionally, this alignment appears to be anti-correlated
with total thermal dust emission, showing a tightening alignment with
growing emission.  We analyze and quantify B field, gravity, turbulence,
and their relative importance toward the three cores with various
techniques.  We extract all quantities over two scales, a larger clump area
at 0.6 pc scale and the smaller core area at 2 pc scale. While we find that
gravitational energy, B field, and turbulent pressure all grow
systematically from large to small scale for the three cores, we reveal
that the ratios among the three constituents develop clearly differently
over scale. We propose that this varying relative importance between B
field, gravity, and turbulence over scale drives and explains the different
fragmentation types seen at sub-pc scale (no fragmentation in MM1; aligned
fragmentation in MM2; clustered fragmentation in MM3). We discuss
uncertainties, subtleties, and robustness of our conclusion, and we stress
the need of a multi-scale joint analysis to understand the dynamics in
these systems.
