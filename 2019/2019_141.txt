*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________
Speaker:        Freeke van de Voort (MPA)
Topic:          Cosmic gas flows and their effect on galaxy formation
Time:           9/4 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Galaxies are intimately connected to the environments they live in. The
haloes around them contain the gas reservoir from which the galaxies
grow, while galactic outflows heat and enrich this circumgalactic medium
(CGM). In this talk, I will use ALMA observations and cosmological,
hydrodynamical simulations to show how the gas dynamics affects the
growth of galaxies on all scales, from the interstellar medium (ISM) to
the intergalactic medium. Our observations reveal that the star
formation efficiency of early-type galaxies can be suppressed if their
molecular gas disc is morphologically and kinematically disturbed. Our
high-resolution simulations show that the CGM has higher overdensities
than previously thought, which strongly affects predicted observables in
the CGM. For example, the neutral hydrogen (HI) column density and
H-alpha emission from ionised gas are dramatically enhanced, more in
line with observations. I will end by showing how, at high redshift,
sheets in the cosmic web can fragment and lead to high HI column density
systems with no associated metals, explaining observations of metal-free
Lyman Limit Systems.

Speaker:        Yin Li (Kavli IPMU / UC Berkeley)
Topic:          Model the Nonlinear Universe with Machine Learning
Time:           9/5 (Thursday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Cosmological structure formation is a highly nonlinear process that forms the
tiny fluctuations of the early universe into the cosmic web at the late time.
Its accurate and efficient modeling is necessary to recover the physical
information contained in the early-universe fluctuations from the late-time
observables.
The two conventional approaches are the numerical simulation and the
perturbation theory, with the former being accurate but computationally costly,
while the latter being fast but invalid below the nonlinear scale.
Machine learning offers a promising third route, given its many huge successes
at building nonlinear mappings.
Trained with N-body simulations, our deep learning models can predict structure
formation with a comparable accuracy, much higher than that of the perturbation
theories, at only a moderate cost.
I will also discuss other applications and ongoing works towards building a
complete forward model of the observable Universe.

Speaker:        Tetsuya Hashimoto (NTHU)
Topic:          Recent three discoveries from NTHU cosmology group
Time:           9/6 (Friday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
I will present my recent papers on (i) a blue cluster in the local Universe,
(ii) the luminosity-duration relation of fast radio bursts (FRBs), and
(iii) ALMA observations of Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) host galaxies.
Brief summaries of each paper are as follows.
>
(i) A young galaxy cluster in the old Universe:
We discovered a 'blue cluster', that is a local galaxy cluster with an
unprecedentedly high fraction of blue star-forming galaxies yet hosted
by a massive dark matter halo. The blue cluster challenges the current
standard understanding of galaxy formation under the Lambda CDM
Universe.
>
(ii) Luminosity-duration relation of fast radio bursts:
We discovered an empirical correlation between luminosity and duration
of FRBs. We propose a new distance measure using the relation of FRBs,
which can reach more distant Universe than type Ia supernovae in quantity\.
This method can potentially reveal the time variability of the dark energy,
which is one of the central foci of observational cosmology.
>
(iii) SFRs of two GRB host galaxies at z~2 and a [CII] deficit observed with
ALMA:
We discovered a new parameter to characterize GRB host galaxies, [CII] deficit,
by overcoming a serious dust-extinction problem of GRB host galaxies.
Possible parameters controlling the deficit include the metallicity,
initial mass function, and gas density.
