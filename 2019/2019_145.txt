Taiwan

The Graduate Institute of Astronomy at National Central University (NCU) in
Taiwan invites applications for a new faculty position beginning from
August 2020. A Ph.D. in astronomy or a closely related field is required
prior to the start of the appointment. Duties include research, teaching,

*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________
Speaker:        Freeke van de Voort (MPA)
Topic:          Cosmic gas flows and their effect on galaxy formation
Time:           9/4 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Galaxies are intimately connected to the environments they live in. The
haloes around them contain the gas reservoir from which the galaxies
grow, while galactic outflows heat and enrich this circumgalactic medium
(CGM). In this talk, I will use ALMA observations and cosmological,
hydrodynamical simulations to show how the gas dynamics affects the
growth of galaxies on all scales, from the interstellar medium (ISM) to
the intergalactic medium. Our observations reveal that the star
formation efficiency of early-type galaxies can be suppressed if their
molecular gas disc is morphologically and kinematically disturbed. Our
high-resolution simulations show that the CGM has higher overdensities
than previously thought, which strongly affects predicted observables in
the CGM. For example, the neutral hydrogen (HI) column density and
H-alpha emission from ionised gas are dramatically enhanced, more in
line with observations. I will end by showing how, at high redshift,
sheets in the cosmic web can fragment and lead to high HI column density
systems with no associated metals, explaining observations of metal-free
Lyman Limit Systems.

Speaker:        Yin Li (Kavli IPMU / UC Berkeley)
Topic:          Model the Nonlinear Universe with Machine Learning
Time:           9/5 (Thursday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Cosmological structure formation is a highly nonlinear process that forms the
tiny fluctuations of the early universe into the cosmic web at the late time.
Its accurate and efficient modeling is necessary to recover the physical
information contained in the early-universe fluctuations from the late-time
observables.
The two conventional approaches are the numerical simulation and the
perturbation theory, with the former being accurate but computationally costly,
while the latter being fast but invalid below the nonlinear scale.
Machine learning offers a promising third route, given its many huge successes
at building nonlinear mappings.
Trained with N-body simulations, our deep learning models can predict structure
formation with a comparable accuracy, much higher than that of the perturbation
theories, at only a moderate cost.
I will also discuss other applications and ongoing works towards building a
complete forward model of the observable Universe.

____________________________________________________
Speaker:        Tetsuya Hashimoto (NTHU)
Topic:          Recent three discoveries from NTHU cosmology group
Time:           9/6 (Friday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
I will present my recent papers on (i) a blue cluster in the local Universe,
(ii) the luminosity-duration relation of fast radio bursts (FRBs), and
(iii) ALMA observations of Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) host galaxies.
Brief summaries of each paper are as follows.
>
(i) A young galaxy cluster in the old Universe:
We discovered a 'blue cluster', that is a local galaxy cluster with an
unprecedentedly high fraction of blue star-forming galaxies yet hosted
by a massive dark matter halo. The blue cluster challenges the current
standard understanding of galaxy formation under the Lambda CDM
Universe.
>
(ii) Luminosity-duration relation of fast radio bursts:
We discovered an empirical correlation between luminosity and duration
of FRBs. We propose a new distance measure using the relation of FRBs,
which can reach more distant Universe than type Ia supernovae in quantity\.
This method can potentially reveal the time variability of the dark energy,
which is one of the central foci of observational cosmology.
>
(iii) SFRs of two GRB host galaxies at z~2 and a [CII] deficit observed with
ALMA:
We discovered a new parameter to characterize GRB host galaxies, [CII] deficit,
by overcoming a serious dust-extinction problem of GRB host galaxies.
Possible parameters controlling the deficit include the metallicity,
initial mass function, and gas density.

---------------------------------------------------------
The ASIAA theory group will hold a workshop on broad topics of galaxy formation and evolution during Dec. 9-11 2019. We invite active researchers in this filed to discuss its latest development and hope to provide a platform for collaborations. We strongly encourage students and postdocs who are working in the field of galaxy formation and evolution to present their work in this workshop.  Please have a look at the workshop website for detailed information;

Dear all,

The Cycle 7 ACA Supplemental Call for Proposals is now open:

The Joint ALMA Observatory (JAO) is now accepting observing proposals for Cycle 7 that request to use the Atacama Compact Array (ACA) in stand-alone mode. Instructions on how to submit proposals can be found on the Cycle 7 Supplemental Call web page (https://almascience.org/proposing/7m-array-supplemental-call).

Users of any nationality or affiliation are invited to submit proposals before the deadline of 15:00 UT on Tuesday 1 October 2019.

Proposals submitted in the Supplemental Call will be peer reviewed using a distributed system in which each proposal team selects a designated reviewer to participate in the review process. The review process is described in detail in the Supplemental Call documentation.

Users should note that the Supplemental Call proposal submission server will not be available for a few hours on September 10 and September 25 because of scheduled maintenance. The precise downtimes will be noted on the Science Portal. Users will need to update the Observing Tool (OT) after the September 10 maintenance period. For most users, this will happen automatically using the automated webstart tool. Information on updating the OT is available at the Observing Tool webpage.


best,
Yu-Nung

Speaker:        Haifeng Yang (Tsinghua University)
Topic:          Origins of (sub)millimeter disk polarization
Time:           9/11 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Polarized (sub)millimeter dust thermal emission has been established as an
important tool to probe magnetic fields. Its application to the protoplanetary
disk, however, hasn't been successful. The first resolved polarization map in
a classical T Tauri system, HL Tau, yields a uniform magnetic fields,
which is a rather unphysical configuration. We were then motivated to search for
alternatives and find that the scattering of dust thermal emission by dust
grains themselves can naturally produce the observed uniform pattern.
I will first review how scattering-induced polarization works and why it has the
potential to study the grain growth, as well as to probe dust settling, which is
hard to do otherwise. I will then focus on the best studied system, the HL Tau
system. This shows a transition from scattering to a complete different picture
as we move from ALMA Band 7 (0.87 mm) to ALMA Band 3 (3 mm). The azimuthal
pattern at Band 3 was initially proposed to come from a third mechanism,
radiative alignment, which is different from either scattering or magnetic
alignment. I will argue that this explanation fails to explain some of the
important features and cannot be the whole story. At the end, I will discuss
the growing tension between scattering-induced polarization and beta-index
method in probing grain sizes.
