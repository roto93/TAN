Title:  The z=3D10^-14 Universe: What Can the Dark Energy Survey Teach Us
About Our Own Solar System?
Abstract: The Dark Energy Survey (DES) is an optical survey targeting
nearly 5000 square degrees of the southern sky to probe the dynamics of the
expanding Universe. The combination of the survey area and depth not only
makes DES a powerful tool for precision cosmology but also well suited to
study the very local Universe: our own solar system. Indeed, DES has
detected more than two hundreds of TNOs =E2=80=94 the distant minor planets=
 in the
trans-Neptunian solar system. In this talk, I will overview the works of
our group, including the discovery of an extreme TNO, 2015 BP519 and the
study of first ever ultra-red colored Neptune Trojan. 2015 BP519 has a
semimajor axis a ~ 450 au, eccentricity e ~ 0.92, and inclination i ~ 54
degrees, makes it one of the most extreme minor planets in our solar
system. The existence of BP519 is difficult to explain, however, a
consequence of hypothetical Planet 9. Unlike the outer planet Trojan
asteroids, the Neptune Trojan 2013 VX30 is ultra-red, and such kind of
color only exist in TNO populations. Therefore, it could be a missing link
between outer planet Trojans and TNO populations.
