Announcement of 3mm VLBI in Cycle 7
Jan 07, 2019

It is expected that phased ALMA will participate in some GMVA observations during ALMA Cycle 7 (Oct 2019 - Sept 2020;  see the ALMA Cycle 7 Pre-announcement).   There are likely to be ~43 ALMA antennas available to the ALMA observation; but the phased sum used for VLBI may be constructed only from those that lie within a circle of radius 0.5 km.   GMVA session dates for 2020 are not yet fixed but Session I in 2020, which is traditionally in the period March - May, would provide an opportunity for  GMVA + ALMA observing. 

Any GMVA proposal requesting phased ALMA during Cycle 7 must be submitted via the NRAO PST at the February 1, 2019 deadline.

Proposers should:

        â€¢ specify "ALMA" in the Other Stations text field in the PST
        â€¢ select the default GMVA 3mm observing mode of 2 Gbps, dual polarization
        â€¢ specify the amount of time and GST range(s) needed for ALMA separately, either in Session Constraints or Comments, or in the Technical Justification.
