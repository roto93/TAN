Speaker:        Marco A. MuÃ±oz-Gutierrez (ASIAA)
Topic:          The Long-term Dynamical Evolution of the 34 Largest Trans-Neptunian Objects in the Solar System
Time:           8/5 (Monday) 12:15 - 13:15
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Through a large set of numerical N-body simulations of the Solar System, we have explored the long term dynamical evolution (up to 1 Gyr) of the 34 largest objects in the Kuiper belt, those with absolute magnitude, H, less than 4, as listed in the Minor Planet Center as of late 2018. Included in our set are the four trans-Neptunian objects currently classified as â€œdwarf planetsâ€  by the International Astronomical Union (namely Pluto, Eris, Haumea, and Makemake), however, throughout our work, we call all the 34 massive trans-Neptunian objects in our set dwarf planets (DPs). All of our simulations included the Sun (with the added mass of all the interior planets, the Moon and Ceres), the four giant planets, from Jupiter to Neptune, as well as the 34 DPs as massive objects. We explored the regular and chaotic behavior of the DPs. We found that most DPs are regular and well behaved (i.e. non-chaotic). Nevertheless, some interesting cases arise, the most notable one being Haum!
 ea, which evolves in a strongly chaotic manner. Some irregular behaviors can be attributed to poorly constrained orbits, as is the case for the recently discovered dwarf planet candidate 2015 RR245, while others seem to be located in highly unstable regions, as is the case of Haumea and 2007 OR10, and to a lesser extent Orcus and 2007 UK126.

Topic:          Star forming galaxies at high redshift: the feedback impact of energetic cosmic rays
Time:           8/8 (Thursday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
High redshift star forming galaxies are complex multi-phase systems where hot interstellar gas, cold dense molecular clouds and energetic particles (i.e. cosmic rays) all coexist. These starburst galaxies are especially likely to be environments abundant in energetic cosmic rays due to the presence of massive stars and their remnants. Stellar remnants can supply seed particles and generate the shocks (via supernova explosions and other violent events) needed to accelerate the seeds to very high energies.  This talk considers the interplay and interactions between the ambient partially ionized gases, dense clouds, and the energetic cosmic ray particles in these environments. I will present the energy deposition rates by cosmic rays as they propagate though their host galaxy and beyond, accounting for their high-energy hadronic interactions with interstellar matter and the influence of developing galactic magnetic fields. I will discuss the astrophysical implications on the ho!
 st galaxy and its circum-galactic environment and outline possible mechanisms by which cosmic ray feedback may operate, with particular reference to the recently observed young high redshift system, MACS1149-JD1.

Dear Yi-Jehng,

Would you please circulate this announce via TAN?

Thank you,

Masa

---------------------------
1st circular, East-Asia AGN Workshop 2020
27-29 April 2020, Chongqing, China
---------------------------

This is the 1st announcement of "East-Asia AGN Workshop 2020
(EAAGN20)", which will be held on 27-29 April 2020 in Chongqing
University, China. Since the first kick-off workshop in 2012,
this is the 7th meeting of a series of workshops focusing on
AGN/SMBH studies carried out in East Asia. The East-Asia AGN
Workshop aims at fostering close collaborations among scientists
(in both observational and theoretical fields) in East Asia. It
is becoming more important to expand and strengthen various
collaborations in East Asia, given a great variety of accessible
facilities currently (e.g., ALMA, JCMT, SMA, GLT, international
VLBIs, Subaru, Gemini, etc.) and also in near future (e.g., GMT,
TMT, XRISM, SPICA, etc.) for East-Asia astronomers. This workshop
will provide an interesting opportunity to learn the exciting
scientific results on AGN/SMBH achieved by East-Asia astronomers,
and to build up new collaborations among East-Asia astronomers.

Chongqing is a major city, and municipality, in southwest China.
Central Chongqing is in the eastern edge of Sichuan Basin.
Yangtze River meets its major tributary stream, Jialing River, in
Central Chongqing. Being one of China's National Central Cities,
it serves as the economic centre of the upstream Yangtze basin.
It is a major manufacturing centre and transportation hub.
Chongqing is known for its spicy food, as part of Sichuan cuisine.
Chongqing hot pot is known as Chongqing's local culinary specialty.
