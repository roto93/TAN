Title:     Detecting and Characterising Giant Planets with Direct Imaging
Abstract:    Direct detection, and direct spectroscopy in particular, have
great potential for advancing our understanding of extrasolar planets. In
combinations with other methods of planet detection, direct imaging and
spectroscopy will allow us to eventually: 1) fully map out the architecture
of typical planetary systems and 2) study the atmospheric properties of
exoplanets in depth. I will discuss in particular the constraints on the
distributions of wide giant exoplanets placed by the current generation of
direct imaging surveys. Variability attributed to cloud structure already
appears to be a persistent feature for L and T type field brown dwarfs,
potentially due to the breakup of thick silicate and iron condensate clouds
during the L to T spectral type transition. Directly imaged planets occupy
the same temperature regime as L and T type brown dwarfs and are likely to
be equally variable. I will also discuss the prospects for detecting and
characterising exoplanet weather patterns through monitoring the intrinsic
photometric variability of these objects.

Title:      Catching the Next Burst: The JCMT Transient Survey
Abstract:    Most protostars have luminosities that are fainter than
expected from steady-state accretion. One solution to this problem may lie
in episodic mass accretion wherein protostars undergo prolonged periods of
very low accretion punctuated by short bursts of rapid accretion. The
timescales and amplitudes of these bursts and subsequent relaxations are
almost entirely unconstrained at the protostellar phase. The James Clerk
Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) Transient Survey is the first dedicated
submillimetre-wavelength program focused on detecting variability events at
the earliest stages of star formation. The Transient Survey performs
monthly continuum observations of 8 nearby (<500 pc) star-forming regions
at 450 and 850 microns. The survey area contains ~1,000 young stellar
objects ranging from Class 0 (deeply embedded) protostars to more evolved
Class II (disk-type) objects. By employing relative flux calibration
techniques, light curves are produced with an unprecedented precision of
2%-3% rms at 850 microns and 4-6% rms at 450 microns. To date, more than a
dozen sources have shown signs of accretion variability. Additionally, the
data uncovered the first coronal flare discovered at submillimeter
wavelengths; an event interpreted as a magnetic reconnection that energized
charged particles to emit gyrosynchrotron/synchrotron radiation. The light
curve of this most luminous stellar flare on record displayed a decrease in
brightness by a factor of two in less than 30 minutes. The JCMT Transient
Survey began in December, 2015 and will continue through at least January,
2020.
