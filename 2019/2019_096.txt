Dear Colleagues,

I am forwarding the information of contributed abstract submissions to the
two conferences "APPC-2019" and "AAPPS-DPP 2019". The deadline is around
the corner and my apologies for the short notice.

APPC-2019 is the 14th Asia-Pacific Physics Conference organized by AAPPS
(Association of Asia Pacific Physical Societies). It will be held on
November 17-22 2019, at Borneo Convention Centre, Kuching, Sarawak,
Malaysia http://appc2019.ifm.org.my/. In addition to APPC, the Division of
Plasma Physics of AAPPS (AAPPS-DPP) is having an annual Asia-Pacific
Conference on Plasma Physics to be held in Hefei, Anhui, China during Nov.
4-8, 2019. The Solar/Astro panel of the program committee is encouraging
abstract submissions related to astrophysical plasmas.

Best regards,
Pin-Gao Gu
ASIAA
