Topic:          The Long-term Dynamical Evolution of the 34 Largest Trans-Neptunian Objects in the Solar System
Time:           8/5 (Monday) 12:15 - 13:15
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Through a large set of numerical N-body simulations of the Solar System, we have explored the long term dynamical evolution (up to 1 Gyr) of the 34 largest objects in the Kuiper belt, those with absolute magnitude, H, less than 4, as listed in the Minor Planet Center as of late 2018. Included in our set are the four trans-Neptunian objects currently classified as â€œdwarf planetsâ€  by the International Astronomical Union (namely Pluto, Eris, Haumea, and Makemake), however, throughout our work, we call all the 34 massive trans-Neptunian objects in our set dwarf planets (DPs). All of our simulations included the Sun (with the added mass of all the interior planets, the Moon and Ceres), the four giant planets, from Jupiter to Neptune, as well as the 34 DPs as massive objects. We explored the regular and chaotic behavior of the DPs. We found that most DPs are regular and well behaved (i.e. non-chaotic). Nevertheless, some interesting cases arise, the most notable one being Haum!
 ea, which evolves in a strongly chaotic manner. Some irregular behaviors can be attributed to poorly constrained orbits, as is the case for the recently discovered dwarf planet candidate 2015 RR245, while others seem to be located in highly unstable regions, as is the case of Haumea and 2007 OR10, and to a lesser extent Orcus and 2007 UK126.

Topic:          Star forming galaxies at high redshift: the feedback impact of energetic cosmic rays
Time:           8/8 (Thursday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
High redshift star forming galaxies are complex multi-phase systems where hot interstellar gas, cold dense molecular clouds and energetic particles (i.e. cosmic rays) all coexist. These starburst galaxies are especially likely to be environments abundant in energetic cosmic rays due to the presence of massive stars and their remnants. Stellar remnants can supply seed particles and generate the shocks (via supernova explosions and other violent events) needed to accelerate the seeds to very high energies.  This talk considers the interplay and interactions between the ambient partially ionized gases, dense clouds, and the energetic cosmic ray particles in these environments. I will present the energy deposition rates by cosmic rays as they propagate though their host galaxy and beyond, accounting for their high-energy hadronic interactions with interstellar matter and the influence of developing galactic magnetic fields. I will discuss the astrophysical implications on the ho!
 st galaxy and its circum-galactic environment and outline possible mechanisms by which cosmic ray feedback may operate, with particular reference to the recently observed young high redshift system, MACS1149-JD1.
