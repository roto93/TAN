There will be a conference on astronomical telescopes
and instruments, to be held September 2 to 5 in
Kaohsiung.  The eighth in the series, held once every two years and
alternating between Taiwan and China, this meeting aims to bring together
scientists and engineers to keep breast of the ongoing developments of
observing facilities and latest technological advancements.  Over the years
the meeting serves as an effective vehicle to foster
collaboration with Chinese astronomers.

The meeting will be run in Mandarin Chinese, but speakers could choose to
present in English.
