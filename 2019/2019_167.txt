Subject: First announcement of EAYAM 2020
To: Taiwan Astronomy Network <astro@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw>

The East Asian Young Astronomers Meeting (EAYAM) was first organized in
2003 to promote interaction and collaboration between young astronomers in
East Asia. The success of the initial meeting in Taiwan was followed by
EAYAM 2006 in Japan, EAYAM 2008 in China, EAYAM 2011 in Korea, EAYAM 2015
in Taiwan, and EAYAM 2017 in Japan. We are pleased to announce that EAYAM
2020 will once again be held in China, between May. 17-21, 2020, at the
National Astronomy Observatory of China (NAOC), Chinese Academy of Sciences
(CAS) in Beijing.

The main goal of the meeting is to bring young astronomers together,
encouraging them to present recent research, form new collaborations, and
exchange their experiences of an early-stage science career. Graduate
students and postdocs are encouraged to participate -- especially those who
are either originally from, or currently work in the East Asia region. All
participants are expected to give either an oral or a poster presentation
to stimulate discussion and interaction. Following the abstract submission
deadline (Feb. 15, 2020), the SOC will select the oral presentations for
the final program. All of those who are not granted their preferred oral
presentation will be allowed a poster contribution.

There is no conference registration fee. To register and submit an
abstract, please visit following website
