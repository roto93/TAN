Abstract:
In this talk, I will talk about recent progress of  theoretical studies about circumstellar disk formation. In particular, I will focus on the impact of non-ideal MHD effect. Recent theoretical studies have shown that non-ideal MHD effects (Ohmic diffusion, Hall effect, ambipolar diffusion) play crucial roles for protostar and circumstellar disk formation and evolution. Ohmic and ambipolar diffusion decouple the gas and the magnetic field, and significantly reduces the magnetic torque in the first core and disk, which enables the formation of the circumstellar disk at the formation epoch of protostar. Ambipolar diffusion set an upper limit to the magnetic field strength of ~ 0.1 G  in and around the newly born disk (Masson+16, Tsukamoto+17). Hall effect notably changes the magnetic torques in the envelope around the disk, and strengthens or weakens the magnetic braking depending on the relative orientation of magnetic field and angular momentum (Krasnopolsky+11, Tsukamoto+15!
 b, Tsukamoto+17). This suggests that the bimodal evolution of the disk size may realize in the early disk evolutionary phase. Hall effect and ambipolar diffusion imprint the characteristic velocity structures in the envelope of Class 0/I YSOs. Hall effect makes a counter-rotating envelope around the disk. Our simulations show that counter rotating envelope has the size of 100-1000 AU.  Ambipolar diffusion causes the significant ion-neutral drift in the envelope. Our estimate show that the drift velocity of ion could become significant  (~km/s ) in the Class 0/I YSOs.
