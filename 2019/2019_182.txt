Topic:         Unexpected multiple bursts of star formation in young star clusters: The case of the Orion Nebula Cluster and Orion relic filament
Time:         11/18 (Monday) 12:15 - 13:15
Place:          R1203
Abstract:
Young star clusters (YSCs) with resolved stellar populations are well suited objects for studying and constraining star and star-cluster formation\.
In most cases, the (pre-main-sequence) stellar populations found in the YSCs are largely coeval with an intrinsic age spread of up to 1 Myr.
Such observations can be understood as the YSCs having formed in one burst and star formation having been truncated by stellar feedback.
The observed presence of an age spread of up to several Myr, reported for some YSCs, may be explainable as arising from older stars being captured in the forming YSC.
The recent discovery by Beccari et al. (2017) that the colour-magnitude diagram of the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) contains three well defined populations appears to
shatter this model.
The only currently viable explanation is that the three sequences are stars with an age difference of about 1Myr. The implication is that the ONC formed in three bursts,
with star formation still on-going in the last burst.
I will present new observational results focusing on the three populations in the ONC  and the binary content of the ONC using OmegaCAM photometry in combination with Gaia DR2 position and proper motion data.
Then I will introduce a theoretical model which may explain these observations by an interplay between stellar feedback and cluster dynamics. I will conclude with putting the multiple populations
in the ONC  into the general observational context of YSCs. The final part of my talk will emphasise the role of gas filaments in star-formation and present the new discovery of stellar relic filaments that are promising probes of later stages of filamentary star-formation.

Topic:         Cosmology with the Domain-dependent Expansion Rate as a Possible
Solution to the Hubble Constant Problem
Time:         11/18 (Monday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:          R1203
Abstract:
There appears to be a discrepancy in the measured values of the Hubble
constant in different scales. In fact, the Hubble constant inferred
from the Planck satellite mission differs from that obtained by the
magnitude-redshift relation of Type Ia supernovae by more than 3
sigma. In this talk, we show that the discrepancy can be resolved by
introducing a local expansion rate generated by the domain-dependent
averaged density within the framework of general relativity. It is
shown that the locally averaged density which differs from the
globally averaged density generates locally averaged Hubble constant,
as well as the locally averaged spatial curvature irrespective of the
global background curvature and the existence of the cosmological
constant.

Topic:         The Mass and Ages of Young Stars
Time:         11/19 (Tuesday) 15:30 - 16:30
Place:          R1203
Abstract:
Understanding when and how planet forms requires an appropriate clock to time the events.
Age not being a direct observable, our best current clock is based on a comparison of
star    properties with theoretical evolutionary models. However, to provide reliable ages, these
models must be validated against measurements of the star's properties, namely Luminosity,
Color (effective temperature or spectral type) and Mass.
    I will present the result of a long term study which allowed us to determine the absolute
masses of about 40 young stars in the Taurus region. The comparison between these masses
and those predicted by evolutionary tracks on an HR diagram rules out many models, leaving
only the most recent magnetic models as compatible with the data.
    Such models result in predicted ages that are typically 3 times larger than currently
believed, which has significant impact on our understanding of star and planet formation.

Topic:         Detecting dark matter
Time:         11/19 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:          CCMS R104
Abstract:
Neither the standard model of particle physics nor direct detection experiments have yielded any need nor any evidence for the existence of cold or warm dark matter particles. These are only hypothesised to exist if general relativity is extrapolated from the Solar-system scale to galaxies and beyond. Cases in point are the observed non-Keplerian, flat rotation curves of disk galaxies which are the by far dominant population of galaxies and the missing mass phenomenon in galaxy clusters. I will discuss the possibility of confirming the existence of such dark matter particles using Chandrasekhar dynamical friction. Explicit test cases are the satellite galaxies of the Milky Way, the M81 group of galaxies and Hickson compact groups. The observed positions and motion of the galaxies in these systems show that the action of dynamical friction on the speculative dark matter halos is not evident in the data. The systems behave dynamically as if the extended dark matter halos do no!
 t exist. Thus, the orbits of the Milky Way satellite galaxies do not seem to be decaying sufficiently with time, nor are the compact galaxy groups merging.  Corroborative evidence comes from the highly symmetric distribution of all non-satellite galaxies in two 1.5Mpc extended, 50kpc-thick planes in the Local Group around the axis joining the Milky-Way and Andromeda galaxies. This symmetric arrangement of matter on Mpc scales remains entirely unexplained by current cosmological and dynamical theory, and is largely ignored by the community, despite being based on the very best extragalactic data at hand (because the involved galaxies are the nearest galaxies to the Milky Way). Further corroborative evidence comes from the five nearest major galaxies having three highly pronounced disk-of-satellite systems, which together falsify the standard dark-matter-based cosmological model with more than five sigma confidence.  The evidence thus gathered consistently and unanimously sho!
 ws that dark matter particles cannot be present. The observed !
 dynamics therefore cannot be Newtonian, but must, in the classical limit, essentially be Milgromian, and cosmological theory needs a major repositioning. As a consequence, our ability to deduce the physics of galaxy evolution from observation is probably wrong as it is at present based on assuming the standard cosmological model is valid.

Topic:         The systematically varying stellar IMF and some implications thereof
Time:         11/20 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:          R1203
Abstract:
Some ultra-compact dwarf galaxies have large dynamical mass to light (M/L) ratios and also appear to contain an overabundance of LMXB sources, and some Milky Way globular clusters have a low concentration and appear to have a deficit of low-mass stars. These observations can be explained if the stellar IMF becomes increasingly top-heavy with decreasing metallicity and increasing gas density of the forming object. The thus constrained stellar IMF then accounts for the observed trend of metallicity and M/L ratio found amongst M31 globular star clusters. Since the galaxy-wide IMF (gwIMF) is made up of the IMFs of all embedded cluster forming in a galaxy, it becomes possible to calculate the gwIMF. This calculation shows that the systematically varying IMF accounts for the overall shift of the observationally deduced gwIMF from top-light to top-heavy with increasing star formation rate amongst galaxies. This is an important self-consistency check between star formation on pc sca!
 les and galaxy-wide stellar populations. The implications of this for observations of extremely young very massive star-burst clusters observed at a high redshift which may appear quasar-like will be discussed based on our recent work (Jerabkova et al. 2017).

Topic:         Consistency relations in the large scale structure of the universe
Time:         11/21 (Thursday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:          R1203
Abstract:
There are some consistency relations between multi-point correlation functions of the cosmological fluctuations known to be valid exactly or asymptotically exactly under any nonlinear effects at the non-perturbative level. These are derived based only on Gaussian initial condition and equivalence principle, and/or, the approximate universality in the equation of motion, making them a powerful avenue for the test of fundamental assumptions in cosmology. I explain how these relations can be used to provide robust theoretical predictions and to break the degeneracy between the level of cosmological perturbations and the unknown bias factor of luminous tracers.
