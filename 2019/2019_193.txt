Dear Yi-Jehng,

can you please help circulating this announcement through TAN?
Thanks.

"The ALMA 2030 Vision: Design considerations for Digitizers, Backend and
Data Transmission System"
March 11-13, NAOJ, Mitaka, Japan

https://alma-intweb.mtk.nao.ac.jp/~diono/meetings/ALMA2030_Mitaka/

The ALMA Development Roadmap has identified the multiplication of the IF
bandwidth of ALMA (at least by a factor 2) as one of the main priorities
for ALMA upgrades in the 2020s. This increase of the instantaneous
bandwidth will be realized with the coordinated upgrade of receivers in the
Front End, the correlators, and last but not least, all electronics between
them: digitizers, backend and Data Transmission System (DTS). This meeting
aims to bring together experts on the ALMA system and digitizer, backend
and data transmission system technologies, from within ALMA and from the
community, in order to:

(1) discuss the status of technology and performance prospects for the next
decade for digitizers, backend and DTS,

(2) identify the impact on these subsystems due to the increase of the
instantaneous bandwidth by a factor >2,

(3) discuss the most suitable location of the 2nd generation ALMA
correlators in relation with the status of DTS technologies,

(4) identify the possibility to use off-the-shelf technologies for the
implementation of the 2nd generation of ALMA digitizers, backend and DTS,

(5) discuss on possible system architectures to implement the
multiplication of the IF bandwidth of ALMA by a factor >2.

We particularly encourage participation by young scientists, and we have a
modest amount of travel support.
