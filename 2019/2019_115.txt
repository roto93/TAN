Dear Yi-Jehng,

Would you please circulate the following lecture series at NTHU via TAN?
Thanks.

Albert

**************************************
The Institute of Astronomy of National Tsing Hua University will organise a
distinguished lecture series on compact objects and astrophysical transport
phenomena in this summer. All the lectures will be given by Prof. Kinwah Wu
from the Mullard Space Science Laboratory of the University College London.
Everyone is welcome. For further information, please contact Prof. Albert
Kong (akong@gapp.nthu.edu.tw).

Distinguished Lecture Series
Compact Objects and Astrophysical Transport Phenomena

Lecturer: Prof. Kinwah Wu (MSSL/UCL)

Date and Time: July 31, August 2, 5, 12, and 14 from 14:00 to 17:00

Venue: Room 521 (Room 501 for August 2), General Building II (Institute of
Astronomy), National Tsing Hua University

##########################################################

Content:

(1) White dwarfs, neutron stars and black holes (3 x 180 min)
Jul 31, Aug 02, Aug 05
The course will give astronomy and astrophysics students a more
comprehensive understanding of the physics of white dwarfs, neutron stars
and neutron stars. Although advanced mathematical tools will be used, the
lectures will put an emphasis on the astronomical perspective instead of on
a mathematical perspective.

(2) Transport equation -  an astrophysics perspective (2 x 180 min)
Aug 12, Aug 14
Transport phenomena are present in all kind of astronomical systems and it
is essential for astronomy and astrophysics students to be familiar the
basic physics of transport and how to construct an appropriate formulation
for practical applications. The lectures will focus on two specific
aspects: the transport of light and transport of particles. In particular,
radiative transfer processes will be covered in detail. If time allows,
advanced topics such as general relativistic radiative transfer and
cosmic-ray transport will be discussed.

Requirement:
A good understanding of classical mechanics and electromagnetism is
essential. A good working knowledge of algebra and calculus is essential.
Knowledge in quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics, thermodynamics and
optics/waves will be helpful. Some knowledge in differential equations is
desirable but not essential. Advanced knowledge in astronomy is not
required.
