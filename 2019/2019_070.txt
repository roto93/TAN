Title:  Hayabusa2 and JAXA small body exploration program
Abstract: In the JAXA small body exploration program, we target at those
small bodies born in the outer part of the solar system, outside the
snowline. While these bodies are considered to play substantial roles in
making our planet habitable, there are variety of them, and multiple
missions are necessary to obtain matured understanding of the nature of
these bodies. Indeed, systematic exploration is what the JAXA small body
exploration program is aiming at. Hayabusa2 is the first in the program and
is a sample return mission to a primitive asteroid. After its arrival at
the asteroid Ryugu in June 2018, many steps have been taken to overcome the
challenges posed by the unfriendly nature of Ryugu and to acquire a sample
of high scientific value. Engineers and scientists have been working
together to make a series of successful events including the touch-and-go
sampling from the surface on February 22, 2019. What does it take to visit
a new asteroid and to grab a sample back from it? This talk will answer the
question from a Hayabusa2 perspective.
