Title: The first image of the shadow of super massive black hole in M87
Abstract: On 10th April 2019, we, the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration
(EHTC), are pleased to present the image of the shadow of the supermassive
black hole (SMBH) for the first time in human history.  M87 was observed
with the EHT on
April 5, 6, 10 and 11, 2017 with 7 stations (ALMA, APEX, IRAM 30m, JCMT,
LMT, SMA, SMT) located at 5 different sites on Earth. After a long process
of careful data validation, calibration and many cross-checks by the EHTC,
the final 1.3 mm VLBI image of M 87 reveals an asymmetric ring morphology
of the central compact radio source with a diameter of 42=C2=B13 uas. The r=
ing
is almost circular and encompasses a central brightness depression of >
10:1.  The robustness of this feature over multiple days strongly suggests
that we see gravitationally
lensed emission originating from near the black hole event horizon. The
asymmetry is from Doppler beaming due to relativistic rotation in the
emitting plasma. From the measured ring size, we derived a black hole mass
of MBH=3D(6.5=C2=B10.7)=C3=9710^9 Msun. The image provides solid evidence f=
or the
presence of the SMBH at the center of M87 and supports the longstanding
hypothesis that supermassive black holes power active galactic nuclei.
Moreover, it demonstrates that millimeter VLBI offers a powerful method to
explore gravity in its most extreme limit and at a previously inaccessible
mass scale.
I will summarize our discovery and state contribution of Taiwan.
