Topic:          Why we saw the Black Hole in M87, but not in the Milky Way?
Time:           7/15 (Monday) 12:15 - 13:15
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
This is a public talk I gave at Helsinki last month. I will briefly explain a few basic information about black hole, and then explain why we saw the black hole in M87, but not in the Milky Way.  Since this talk was for the general public, I did not use any equations, so everyone is welcome to join, if
you are interested in.


*** Colloquium ***

Speaker:        Satoshi Ohashi (RIKEN)
Topic:          ALMA polarization observations toward protoplanetary disks
Time:           7/17 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Protoplanetary disks (PPDs) are beleived to be birth places of planets. Recent ALMA high resolution observations have shown prominent structures such as multiple rings and crscent. In order to understand the physical and chemical properties of PPDs,  dust continuum and molecular line observations have been carried out with ALMA. Here, we introduce another observing mode, which is the polarization of dust continuum emission. The mechanisms of the polarization have been discussed with great attention  since ALMA succeeded in detecting the polarized emission from the protoplanetary disk of HD 142527 (Kataoka et al. 2016). Taking into account the grain growth in PPDs to form planets,  dust polarization is possibly produced by magnetic fields, radiation, gas flow, and scattering. Identifying the polarization mechanisms allow us to understand the physical conditions of PPDs such as dust grain size, dust scale height, or magnetic field structure. In this talk, I will show recent re!
 sults of ALMA polarization observations.  In particular, I focus on the two different morphology disks (a lopsided disk and multiple rings). For a lopsided disk, we found different polarization mechanisms of self-scattering and magnetic fields between north and south regions.  These different polarizations can be understood by different grain size distributions (Ohashi et al. 2018). The magnetic fields are toroidal. For multiple rings, we found that the polarization is produced by self-scattering. The dust grains are 140 micrion in the gaps, while those are much larger (or smaller) in the rings. Furthermore, the dust scale height needs to be less than one-third of the gas scale height inside the 70 au ring,  while it reaches two-thirds of the gas scale height outside of the 70 au ring. Then, we can constrain the gas turbulence to be $\alpha\lesssim1.5\times10^{-3}$ at the 50 au gap and $\alpha\sim 0.015-0.3$ at the 90 au gap, respectively. The transition of the turbulent st!
 rength at the boundary of the 70 au ring indicates the existen!
 ce of the dead zone (Ohashi & Kataoka submitted to ApJ).

This workshop is open for everyone.
Please feel free to attend it.
(You can find the program in the above link.)

Dear Yi-Jehng,

I would appreciate it if you could circulate the â€œCall for SMA-Taiwan
Key Science Proposalsâ€  to TAN.

Thank you,
Naomi

================================================

Dear colleague,

The SMA-Taiwan (SMA-T) invites key science programs requiring substantial amount of time spreading over the multiple semesters.  The SMA-T key science project is aimed at achieving significant scientific impact using the capabilities of the SMA such as wide bandwidth and large field-of-view efficiently. The project will be conducted using the ASIAA time of the SMA, which is 13 % of the total SMA observing time. Each semester, approximately half of the ASIAA time will be allocated to the approved key science project.

Prospective PIs of the SMA-T key science projects need to submit a Notice of Intent (NoI) in advance of the submission of a full proposal. The full proposal must be submitted by the deadline of the regular science proposals.

The deadlines for consideration in the 2019B cycle are"
Notice of Intent: 2019 Aug. 8 (Thu.) 24:00 CST
Full submission:: 2019 Sep. 6 (Fri.) 4:00 CST

For detail of the SMA-T Key Science Projects, please refer to 
        http://sma.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/proposal_key.php

Note that this opportunity is open to the researchers in Taiwanese institutions including ASIAA Hawaii. 

Questions may be addressed to
        hirano [at] asiaa [dot] sinica [dot] edu [dot] tw.


Regards,
Naomi Hirano (on behalf of the SMA-Taiwan)
