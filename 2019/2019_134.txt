Dear colleagues,

There will be  JCMT Transient Survey workshop next week at NCU, in Room
1013 of the Astronomy Institute.  The program aims to detect and
characterize episodic brightening events associated with circumstellar
accretion, or chromospheric magnetic reconnection.  A total of eight nearby
star-forming regions are being monitored in submillimeter wavelengths,
about once per month for the last three years, affording first ever such
time series studies, and upon stacking, the deepest stacking images.

A few survey team members will give talks that may be of interest to you.
In addition, a few local experts on YSO variability in general will add
diversity to the discussions.

The tentative agenda follows.  Those marked with asterisks,on Tuesday
morning August 20, are likely attractive to an audience at large, whereas
some other presentations may be technical. You are cordially invited to
any, or all, of the sessions.

Cheers,
Wen Ping

> Date: Mon, 12 Aug 2019 18:38:36 +0800
> From: nkw <nkw@phys.sinica.edu.tw>

It is our great pleasure and honor to invite you to participate in the
APCTP School/Workshop on Gravitational-Wave Cosmology which will be held
on November 30 to December 4, 2019 in Taipei, Taiwan.

The School/Workshop website:
https://www.phys.sinica.edu.tw/~gwc19/index.php

The school/workshop is an event of the APCTP cooperative external
activity program. The school/workshop will concentrate on gravitational
waves generated from inflation and other cosmological processes, as well
as from compact binary mergers, and on their potential detections in
cosmic microwave background B-polarization experiments and
ground-based/space-borne gravity-wave detectors, as well as using
gravitational-wave sources to do cosmological measurements.

The main purpose of the school/workshop is to provide a good opportunity
for young scientists, master and PhD students coming from universities
and institutes in the Asia-Pacific region to develop regional exchange
activities, mutual understanding and cooperation, as well as stimulate
scientific training and education.

The School/Workshop will support students' travel expenses.

        * Cosmological perturbations in inflation and expanding universe
        * Astrophysical and cosmological gravity-wave sources
        * Black-hole and neutron-star mergers
        * Primordial black holes
        * Detection of gravitational waves and data pipeline
        * Standard sirens and the latest results from LIGO-Virgo
        * Tests of gravity and constraints on modified theories of gravity
        * Cosmic microwave background B-mode polarization

*** Seminar ***
____________________________________________________
Speaker:        Chien-Chang Feng (Tokyo U.)
Topic:          Stellar Explosions of the Neutron Star and White Dwarf Collisions
Time:           8/22 (Thursday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
The merge of two neutron stars have been observed in both gravitaional wave source GW170817 electromagnetic observation, which is mainly powered by radioactivity of r-process elements(Smartt et al. 2017). In order to study the similar scenario of the merger of a neutron star and white dwarf, we simulate the direct collision of a neutron star and white dwarf and examine the explosion signature of this event.  The simulations have shown this kind of impact will trigger deflagration burning of the white dwarf and expose whole star eventually. During the explosion small amount of radioactive 51Ni is synthesised and energy level is close to Type-Ia supernova explosion.
