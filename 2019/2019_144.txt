*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________
Speaker:        Haifeng Yang (Tsinghua University)
Topic:          Origins of (sub)millimeter disk polarization
Time:           9/11 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Polarized (sub)millimeter dust thermal emission has been established as an
important tool to probe magnetic fields. Its application to the protoplanetary
disk, however, hasn't been successful. The first resolved polarization map in
a classical T Tauri system, HL Tau, yields a uniform magnetic fields,
which is a rather unphysical configuration. We were then motivated to search for
alternatives and find that the scattering of dust thermal emission by dust
grains themselves can naturally produce the observed uniform pattern.
I will first review how scattering-induced polarization works and why it has the
potential to study the grain growth, as well as to probe dust settling, which is
hard to do otherwise. I will then focus on the best studied system, the HL Tau
system. This shows a transition from scattering to a complete different picture
as we move from ALMA Band 7 (0.87 mm) to ALMA Band 3 (3 mm). The azimuthal
pattern at Band 3 was initially proposed to come from a third mechanism,
radiative alignment, which is different from either scattering or magnetic
alignment. I will argue that this explanation fails to explain some of the
important features and cannot be the whole story. At the end, I will discuss
the growing tension between scattering-induced polarization and beta-index
method in probing grain sizes.
