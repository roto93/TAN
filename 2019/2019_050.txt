Dear colleague,

We would be most grateful if you could distribute the message below among your national community, on behalf of the Office for Young Astronomers (OYA) and its program of International Schools for Young Astronomers (ISYA). We are aiming to reach the young astronomers in your country. There will be full-support grants by the OYA and the Chinese host institutions for the selected students to attend the next ISYA, that will happen in Kunming, China, in October-November 2019.  

King regards,

Itziar Aretxaga and David Mota

ISYA Program Director and Deputy Director



The 42nd International School for Young Astronomers, ISYA2019, will take place in Kunming, China, from the 14th of October to the 3th of November 2019. The International School for Young Astronomers (ISYA) is a long-tradition project of the International Astronomical Union (IAU), nowadays also co-sponsored by the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters (NASL) through the Office for Young Astronomers (OYA). The 42nd school is co-organized by the OYA, and the Yunnan Observatories (YNOs) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).

ISYAs are three-week international postgraduate schools for regions where students have less opportunity to be directly exposed to the full extent of up-to-date astrophysics. They have the purpose of broadening the young students' perspective from international lecturers with up-to-date astrophysics, both on theory and observations. This three-week school will be also beneficial for the academic exchanges within countries, in particular in Asia. Young students of Astronomy, Astrophysics and related sciences will be brought together, and the mutual understanding and friendship between them will be promoted for future collaboration.

Students and young professionals within a broad range of education and experience, from senior undergraduate to postdoctoral level, are welcome to the ISYA2019 held in China. Preference will be given to students in their early career, MSc/PhDs. Priority will be given to applicants from East and Southeast Asia, but other nationalities will also be considered.

Acceptance to the school includes a studentship that covers transportation to Kunming and back to the students¡¦ home location, and full boarding at the ISYA. All selected students are expected to commit 100% of their time to the three-week long program and participate in all scheduled activities.

Registration is now open at http://isya2019.csp.escience.cn/
