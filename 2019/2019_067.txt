Topic:          Star Formation: Column Density PDFs as an Indirect Tracer of
Magnetic fields in Molecular Clouds
Time:           4/29 (Monday) 12:15 - 13:15
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Simulations generally show that non-self-gravitating clouds have a lognormal column density
probability distribution function (PDF), while self-gravitating clouds with active star formation
develop a distinct power-law tail at high column density. The transition point in the column
density PDF between the lognormal and the power-law portion defines the boundary beyond
which the self-gravity becomes dynamically important. In this talk, I will discuss the effect of
strong magnetic fields and turbulence on the evolution of the column density PDFs. I have used
three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations with non-ideal effects to study
different initial conditions and the way they affect the shape of the PDF. Our results are
interesting, including a distinct signature on how a combination of strong magnetic fields and
turbulence influence the power-law slope and the transitional column density between the
lognormal and the power-law portion of the column density PDFs.
