-----

The ALMA Cycle 7 CASA+pipeline: 5.6.1-8 is available for download
(https://casa.nrao.edu/casa_obtaining.shtml)

Important things to note:

* CASA versions prior to 5.6.1-8 cannot be used to import raw ALMA Cycle
7 data due to a change in the data format. CASA 5.6.1-8 and the bundled
Cycle 7 ALMA pipeline has been validated to calibrate and image raw ALMA
data from Cycles 3-7.  Restoration of previously calibrated ALMA data is
recommended to be done in the CASA version originally used for the
calibration, however, we believe that CASA 5.6.1-8 will restore pipeline
calibrated data from CASA 5.4.0 or more recent.

* To alleviate CASA tclean memory issues for large mosaics, more
temporary files are opened on disk than previously when running tclean.
This requires the number of open files limit to be set to at least
ulimit > 16384. Note that linux/macOS have both "hard" and "soft" limits
for open files, a user sees the "soft" limit (only root can change the
hard limit). BOTH must be increased to at least 16384.

To check the ulimit, in bash type
ulimit -Hn (hard limit)
ulimit -Sn (soft limit)
