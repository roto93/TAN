Dear Colleagues,


We are happy to announce that registration is now OPEN for the first =
(2020) SMA Interferometry school at our website: =
https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/sma-school/ =
<https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/sma-school/>

As a reminder, the school will be held on January 12-17th 2020 in =
Hilo, on the Big Island of Hawai'i (conveniently following the Winter =
AAS Meeting in Honolulu), and is organized by the Center for =
Astrophysics, in conjunction with the Academia Sinica Institute of =
Astronomy and Astrophysics and the University of Hawaii.

Updates:

- There will be no registration fee for the school, and support =
towards ground transportation, meals and lodging will be provided. =
Because of the hands-on nature of the school, we will be accepting a =
limited number of 18 participants, which will be selected based on their =
application.

- As part of the application, students will be required to submit a =
brief proposal for an observation with the SMA to be executed (as =
conditions allow) during the school.=20

- The program of the School has now been published. This includes =
lectures and hands-on tutorials, a one-day trip to the Maunakea summit =
including (but not limited to) the SMA, as well as reduction, analysis =
and presentation of results from observations obtained during the =
School.

Registration will close on September 8th, 2019. Admitted and =
waitlisted students will be notified by October 1st, 2019.


Looking forward to seeing you in Hilo,


The Organizing Committee
