"The ALMA 2030 Vision: Design considerations for Digitizers, Backend and
Data Transmission System"
March 11-13, NAOJ, Mitaka, Japan

https://alma-intweb.mtk.nao.ac.jp/~diono/meetings/ALMA2030_Mitaka/

The ALMA Development Roadmap has identified the multiplication of the IF
bandwidth of ALMA (at least by a factor 2) as one of the main priorities
for ALMA upgrades in the 2020s. This increase of the instantaneous
bandwidth will be realized with the coordinated upgrade of receivers in the
Front End, the correlators, and last but not least, all electronics between
them: digitizers, backend and Data Transmission System (DTS). This meeting
aims to bring together experts on the ALMA system and digitizer, backend
and data transmission system technologies, from within ALMA and from the
community, in order to:

(1) discuss the status of technology and performance prospects for the next
decade for digitizers, backend and DTS,

(2) identify the impact on these subsystems due to the increase of the
instantaneous bandwidth by a factor >2,

(3) discuss the most suitable location of the 2nd generation ALMA
correlators in relation with the status of DTS technologies,

(4) identify the possibility to use off-the-shelf technologies for the
implementation of the 2nd generation of ALMA digitizers, backend and DTS,

(5) discuss on possible system architectures to implement the
multiplication of the IF bandwidth of ALMA by a factor >2.

We particularly encourage participation by young scientists, and we have a
modest amount of travel support.

Speaker:    Ngoc Minh Le (ASIAA / Vietnam National University Ho Chi Minh City)
Topic:         Velocity correlation function: discrepancy between simulation and theory prediction
Time:         12/23 (Monday) 12:15 - 13:15
Place:          R1203
Abstract:
In future galaxy surveys such as the PFS survey using the Subaru Telescope, we will be able to measure not only the density fluctuation but also the velocity field up to very large scales. In order to see if the velocity information can be used to extract cosmological information, we measure the velocity correlation function of halos from N-body simulations compare it to the theoretical prediction. We find non-negligible discrepancies between them even on baryon acoustic oscillation scales due to the finite observational volume effect. We are now in the process to fit this discrepancy to understand the observational result and explain its physical meaning.


*** Seminar ***

Speaker:    Hao-Yi Wu (Ohio State University)
Topic:         Probing Cosmic Acceleration with Galaxy Clusters
Time:         12/26 (Thursday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:          R1203
Abstract:
The acceleration of the Universe is one of the biggest puzzles in
physics: is it due to a cosmological constant, dynamical dark energy,
or modification of gravity?  Galaxy clusters provide a unique
opportunity to answer this question.  In this talk, I will first
discuss how we use cluster abundances to constrain cosmic
acceleration, and how weak gravitational lensing effects play a key
role in cluster surveys.  I will then present my research on using
simulations to understand cluster weak lensing signals and to
accurately model covariance matrices.  These results not only mitigate
the systematic errors in current cluster surveys but also help the
optimization of future ground- and space-based missions.
