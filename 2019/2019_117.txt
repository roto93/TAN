Hi Pin-Gao,

I hope all=E2=80=99s well.  This is my annual call to advertise for the 51 =
Peg b
Postdoc Fellowship
<https://www.hsfoundation.org/programs/science/51-pegasi-b-fellowship/guide=
lines-and-application/>
(and
simultaneously for the NASA Hubble/Sagan).  The deadline for the 51 Peg
fellowship has moved up this year to September 20.   If you have any
finishing students in your group or know of anyone else in Taiwan working
on exoplanets, disks, or related fields and who might be interested in
coming to UT Austin to work with me, Caroline Morley, Adam Kraus, Stella
Offner, and/or others in our department, please let us know.  US
citizenship is not required but doctoral degrees must be awarded between
Aug 31 2009-Aug 31 2020. It=E2=80=99s hard to keep up with who=E2=80=99s on=
 the market
these days so any pointers would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Brendan

Dear Yi-Jehng,

Would you please circulate the following lecture series at NTHU via TAN?
Thanks.

Albert

**************************************
The Institute of Astronomy of National Tsing Hua University will organise a
distinguished lecture series on compact objects and astrophysical transport
phenomena in this summer. All the lectures will be given by Prof. Kinwah Wu
from the Mullard Space Science Laboratory of the University College London.
Everyone is welcome. For further information, please contact Prof. Albert
Kong (akong@gapp.nthu.edu.tw).

Distinguished Lecture Series
Compact Objects and Astrophysical Transport Phenomena

Lecturer: Prof. Kinwah Wu (MSSL/UCL)

Date and Time: July 31, August 2, 5, 12, and 14 from 14:00 to 17:00

Venue: Room 521 (Room 501 for August 2), General Building II (Institute of
Astronomy), National Tsing Hua University

##########################################################

Content:

(1) White dwarfs, neutron stars and black holes (3 x 180 min)
Jul 31, Aug 02, Aug 05
The course will give astronomy and astrophysics students a more
comprehensive understanding of the physics of white dwarfs, neutron stars
and neutron stars. Although advanced mathematical tools will be used, the
lectures will put an emphasis on the astronomical perspective instead of on
a mathematical perspective.

(2) Transport equation -  an astrophysics perspective (2 x 180 min)
Aug 12, Aug 14
Transport phenomena are present in all kind of astronomical systems and it
is essential for astronomy and astrophysics students to be familiar the
basic physics of transport and how to construct an appropriate formulation
for practical applications. The lectures will focus on two specific
aspects: the transport of light and transport of particles. In particular,
radiative transfer processes will be covered in detail. If time allows,
advanced topics such as general relativistic radiative transfer and
cosmic-ray transport will be discussed.

Requirement:
A good understanding of classical mechanics and electromagnetism is
essential. A good working knowledge of algebra and calculus is essential.
Knowledge in quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics, thermodynamics and
optics/waves will be helpful. Some knowledge in differential equations is
desirable but not essential. Advanced knowledge in astronomy is not
required.

Topic:          GW Ori: Interactions Between a Triple-star System and its Circumtriple Disk in Action
Time:           7/29 (Monday) 12:15 - 13:15
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
The dynamical interactions between a multiple system of protostars and the protoplanetary disk around them can trigger eccentricity growth and warping of the disk. GW Ori is a hierarchical triple system at a distance of 400 parsec. Two of the stars compose a spectroscopic binary with a separation of ~1 AU, and a tertiary component  was detected by near-infrared interferometry at a projected distance of ~8 AU. The system harbours a circumtriple protoplanetary disk, one of the only few of its kind, with dust extending to ~400 AU, and gas extending to ~1300 AU. Here we present ALMA observations of the dust continuum and molecular gas emission of the circumtriple disk. We discover three dust rings in the disk, which have different inclinations and centroids. We also find a twist in the CO first moment map. These observations strongly indicate that the GW Ori circumtriple disk has misaligned and eccentric rings, and we interpret them as evidence of ongoing dynamical interactions !
 between the triple stars and the circumtriple disk. In addition, the observations hint at the presence of a companion at ~120 AU, which opens a deep gap and effectively breaks the gas disk at that radius.



*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________
Speaker:        Richard Nelson (QMUL)
Topic:          Planet migration in inviscid and laminar protoplanetary discs
Time:           7/31 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
The discovery of more than 4000 confirmed exoplanets over the last 25 years has raised important questions about how planetary systems form and evolve. Planetary formation theories must take into account how the gravitational interaction between growing planets and the surrounding protoplanetary disk influences the orbital evolution of the planets. In recent years, there has been a significant change in our understanding of how protoplanetary disks evolve, and the traditional view of angular momentum transport occurring in disks because of turbulent viscosity has been replaced by one involving layered accretion due to magnetised winds. In this talk, I will discuss our current knowledge of exoplanet systems and how it motivates planet formation theories, and I will present recent work that explores how planetary migration changes when moving from traditional viscous/turbulent models to more modern laminar disc models.



*** Seminar ***
____________________________________________________
Speaker:        Janet Ting-Wan Chen (MPE)
Topic:          ePESSTO+ (the advanced Public ESO Spectroscopic Survey of Transient Objects): survey and scientific output
Time:           8/1 (Thursday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Gathering the ESO community working on supernovae and unusual transients into one coherent team, the Public ESO Spectroscopic Survey of Transient Objects (PESSTO) has revolutionised the exploitation of wide-field surveys, developing efficient synergies with multi-messenger experiments and making the NTT a crucial global facility. In this talk, I will present the advanced ePESSTO+ programme, building on the success of our PESSTO consortium and bridging the gap to the SOXS instrument. Some of our scientific goals include gravitational wave sources, transients that evolve on the timescale of a few days, and those with extreme energetics. I will also present the transients followed-up by the ePESSTO and GROND collaboration, which represent the extreme (e.g. the brightest or the fastest) of the luminosity-space of cosmic transients, providing a new dataset to understand their nature. Finally, I will share my experience on applying for Alexander von Humboldt and Marie SkÅ‚odowska-!
 Curie Fellowships which might be especially helpful for junior researchers.
