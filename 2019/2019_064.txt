Title: Five years after the ALMA Long Baseline Campaign: What we have
learned about star and planet formation in HL Tau

Abstract:
With unprecedented resolution and sensitivity of Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), tens of protoplanetary disks are
found to have fine structures, such as rings and gaps. The protoplanetary
disk around HL Tau is one of the youngest disks showing the fine
structures, and it is considered as a promising candidate site of planet
formation. Over the past five years, we had follow-up studies of HL Tau
with IRAM 30m, JCMT, SMA, and ALMA. In this presentation, I will introduce
gas kinematics from 0.1 pc to 10 au scales around HL Tau revealed by our
observations. On the large scale, we find signs of outflow feedback from a
nearby star on the ambient gas around HL Tau, which could affect the mass
accretion in HL Tau. On the small scale, we find a gas stream flowing onto
the protoplanetary disk around HL Tau as well as a gas gap in the disk. I
will discuss the gaseous disk structures and the gas stream in HL Tau in
the context of planet formation and the implication of the outflow feedback
in HL Tau on the star formation process.
