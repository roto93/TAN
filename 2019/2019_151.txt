***********************************************

The Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) is now routinely producing groundbreaking scientific results in almost all fields of astronomy and astrophysics.  In order to maintain ALMA as the most advanced (sub)mm-wave array in the coming decades, all ALMA partners are now striving to realize the goals presented in the ALMA Development Roadmap. The East Asian ALMA has been holding the EA ALMA Development Workshop every year, with the main aim to present the latest technological advancement and exchange ideas which are relevant to the upgrade of ALMA. This annual workshop is intended to become an effective forum for interaction and discussion between the technical and scientific communities, and the input from the community is key in the establishment of the EA ALMA Development Program. Last year, the main focus of the workshop was "wide IF", which is recognized as the highest priority in the ALMA Development Roadmap. This year, we would like to invite talks and di!
 scussion related to high frequency (bands 8, 9 and 10) observations of ALMA and related hardware and software development.  Apart from this major focus, we will welcome contributions in the fields of antennas, front-ends, back-ends, and software development and related talks in science, science operations and/or commissioning of new capabilities.
