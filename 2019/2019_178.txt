The 9th East Asian Numerical Astrophysics Meeting (EANAM 2020)
September 14-18, 2020 at Tenbusu Naha, Okinawa, Japan

Aims and Scope:
Numerical simulations have become even more important as detailed =
comparisons between theories and observations are now possible at a =
deeper level in most fields of astrophysics. The aim of this series of =
meetings is to bring (but not limited to) East-Asian numerical =
astrophysicists together and provide chances to learn each other's work =
and explore possible collaborations among them. The scope of the meeting =
will encompass all major astronomical research fields that involve =
numerical simulations, including (but not limited to) cosmology, =
astronomical hydrodynamics, magnetohydrodynamics, radiative transfer, =
particle acceleration, and planetary/stellar/galactic dynamics. In =
addition, there will also be a focus on computer science applications =
directed toward astrophysics including numerical methods, simulation =
data analysis, high performance computing, and optimization for use on =
large scale computer clusters. Participants from outside of the East =
Asia are warmly welcomed as w
ell.
