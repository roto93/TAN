Topic:         Gas Accretion Caught in the Act
Time:         6/24 (Monday) 12:15 - 13:15
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
Gas accretion plays a crucial role in galaxy formation and evolution. Indeed, the growth in the stellar masses of galaxies over cosmic time occurs mainly through the accretion of gas from the environment, and no local star-forming galaxies can continue forming stars without replenishing their gas. As the inflow brings metal-poor gas into a galaxy, it lowers the metallicity in the local ISM, meaning that the metallicity distribution is a signpost to recent gas accretion. Therefore, we searched for regions with anomalously low metallicity in the IFU survey MaNGA. I will present how such regions are distributed within mergers, close pairs, and isolated galaxies, and how gas accretion happens in these systems. I will also discuss the lifetime of such regions, the balance between gas accretion and star formation rates, and the implication for galaxy evolution.

Topic:         Evidence for cloud-cloud collision as a trigger of high-mass star formation in our Galaxy
Time:         6/25 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
The formation processes of massive OB stars and young stellar clusters are still poorly understood. In recent  years,  the  study  of  the  triggered  star  formation through  the cloud-cloud  collision  (CCC) process  has become an  interesting  and  important  topic in  the  star  formation  research.  It  has  been suggested  that  the  CCC  process  can  form  massive  OB  stars  and  young  stellar  clusters  at  the junction of molecular clouds. The onset of the CCC process in a given star-forming region could be observationally inferred through the detection of a bridge feature connecting the two clouds in velocity  space,  the  broad  CO  line  wing  in  the  intersection  of  the  two  clouds,  and  the complementary distribution of the two colliding clouds. However, the investigation of observational signatures of star formation (including massive stars) via the CCC mechanism is still rare and very challenging. A multi-wavelength approach has been effectively used !
as a promising observational tool for understanding the ongoing physical processes in Galactic star-forming regions. In this talk, new observational results of an analysis of some promising Galactic star-forming regions will be presented, where the star formation activities (including massive stars) appear to be influenced by the CCC mechanism at the junction of molecular clouds.

Topic:         Search for Gravitational waves from Big Bang: Recent BICEP results and prospects
Time:         6/26 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
Inflation is a compelling theory that describes the process of Big Bang. Many predictions of inflation theory have been confirmed by observations of cosmic microwave background (CMB) over the last decade. A most exciting, yet unobserved prediction of inflation is the production of a scale-invariant gravitational wave background, which would leave a distinct imprint of â€œB-modeâ€� polarization in the CMB. I will describe the physics behind this prediction, our ongoing effort to search for this signal with the BICEP program at the South Pole, and the outlook for the next decade.

Topic:         The dust emission of galaxies from the local universe to z ~ 10.
Time:         6/28 (Friday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
Galaxies form stars and stars form dust. We found that the 
amount of dust attenuation is not constant over cosmic times but varies 
and presents a maximum at z ~ 1.5. This talk will focus on the related 
aspects of galaxies and dust: 1) can we measure the dust attenuation 
using stellar masses at all redshift? For this first part, we will 
present a novel approach that uses the evolution of the average dust 
attenuation in galaxies. 2) what is the amount of dust attenuation of 
galaxies at 4 < z < 10 and how can we model these galaxies and the 
physical mechanisms controlling the formation/destruction of dust grains 
in the early universe but also more locally, in low-metallicity 
galaxies. For this part, we have collected a sample of Lyman break 
galaxies at 4 < z < 10with ALMA detections and upper limits. Some of 
these galaxies are not detected and several explanations have been 
proposed (evolution of dust temperature, effect of molecular clouds). We 
will suggest another mechanism that has the advantage to also explain 
low-metallicity local dwarf galaxies. Finally, I will shortly present 
ongoing observational programmes performed with IRAM NIKA2 and NOEMA.
