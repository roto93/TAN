Dear colleagues,

Based on our Taiwan-Russia bilateral collaboration,
we are organizing a one-day polarization workshop
at ASIAA on 17 October. For more details, please
have a look at

https://events.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/workshop/20181017/index.php

Please feel free to attend it. We would like
to know how many people will attend it in advance,
so please register if you consider to come.
Of course, everyone is welcome. Any ongoing/incomplete
topic is welcome because this is a starting point of
collaboration.

Regards,
Hiro
