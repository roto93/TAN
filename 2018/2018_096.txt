Topic:          Magnetized molecular torus in the Galactic center - Paradigm of
torus surrounding supermassive black hole in galaxies?
Time:          7/2 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:          R1203
Abstract:
Utilizing James Clark Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) 850 micron SCUPOL dust
polarization data, we investigate the configuration of the magnetic
(B) field in the circumnuclear disk (CND) of the Galactic Center (GC).
The SCUPOL data show a highly improved polarization coverage and
resolution compared to earlier 100 micron observations. The 850 micron
data have a resolution and coverage similar to previous 350 micron
polarimetry data. However, with a proper sampling on a 10" grid, we
find the 850 micron data trace the morphological structures of the CND
substantially better. Furthermore, because the 850 micron trace the
field deeper into the material near Sgr A*, they represent the highest
resolution submillimeter probe to date of the CND magnetic field. The
observed B-field morphology is well described by a self-similar
axisymmetric disk model where the radial infall velocity is one
quarter of the rotational velocity. A detailed comparison with
higher-resolution interferometric maps from the Submillimeter Array
further reveals that the $B$-field aligns with the neutral gas
streamers connecting to the CND. Moreover, the innermost observed
$B$-field structure also appears to trace and align with the
mini-spiral located inside the CND. This suggests that there is one
underlying B-field structure that is connecting the CND with its
streamers and the inner mini-spiral. An estimate of beta_Plasma<=1 -
based on the global B-field morphology that constrains the
azimuthal-to-vertical field strength ratio of around 40 combined with
a measurement of the azimuthal velocity--indicates that the B-field
appears dynamically significant towards the CND and also onwards to
the inner mini-spiral.
