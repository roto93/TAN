Dear Colleagues,

We are pleased to announce the 11th East Asia VLBI Workshop (EAVW) 2018 in
Korea, hosted by the Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute. The venue
is Yong Pyong Resort in PyeongChang where the 2018 Olympic Winter Games was
held and it is also one of the candidate sites for the Extended-KVN.

Since the 1st East Asia VLBI Workshop (EAVW2008) held at Shanghai
Astronomical Observatory (SHAO), China, the EAVW2018 is the 11th workshop.
In particular, this time will be a special meaningful workshop for actual
scientific discussions and collaborations. It is because the First Call for
Proposal for the East Asia VLBI Network (EAVN) was announced in April and
its official operation starts from September 2018.

The EAVW2018 will include recent progress and status of EAVN and focus on
various VLBI science topics in the fields of AGN, evolved stars,
star-forming regions, and Galactic astrometry etc. In addition, Extended
KVN project has been promoted based on the successful operational results
of the 1st step KVN project. The Shanghai 65m Tianma telescope has started
full operation and the 110m telescope (QiTai radio telescope: QTT) by
Xinjiang Astronomical Observatory will begin construction. Furthermore, the
Thailand 40m telescope by NARIT begins to be built and the Greenland
telescope by ASIAA starts to enhance the capability of Submillimeter VLBI.

These rapid developments of East Asian radio astronomy will lead to close
VLBI collaborations in both science and instrumentation at the EAVW2018 and
we hope that many of you will participate.

The registration is now available at the webpage (http://radio.kasi.re.kr/
event/eavn2018) including the detailed information.
*For Chinese participants, we strongly recommend to register as early as
possible so that we can provide necessary documents for your visa process
by post in time.*

Dear colleagues,


The deadline of early registration for the conference below is the end of
this month. It would be nice if a lot of astronomers in Taiwan could show
that we are working on frontiers of galaxy evolution (both observationally
and theoretically). Also, it is a perfect period for red-colored leaves.

Topics:

  -

  State-of-the-art panchromatic galaxy models and studies
  -

  Pushing the redshift frontier: modeling the first galaxies
  -

  Pushing the wavelength frontier: extending models towards X-rays and
  radio
  -

  Pushing the technical frontier: from overwhelmingly large datasets to
  machine learning


Rationale:

How galaxies form and evolve across cosmic times is one of the fundamental
questions in modern astrophysics. In this endeavor, the panchromatic
modeling of galaxies is one of the key tools. As new and next-generation
facilities progressively open a new era in astronomy we enter a new era
where our current approach at modeling the emission galaxies faces a triple
frontier.

The redshift frontier.

The first galaxies in the universe are still largely terra incognita. How
did the first stellar generations form? What are the properties of
population III stars and their effect on their environment? How are their
evolution and spectra affected by rotation and binarity? What can we tell
about their physical conditions (gas density, temperature, metallicity,
etc.) from the recombination line spectra? How did the dust form in such
extreme objects? Since its inception, ALMA has been providing excellent
opportunities for probing dust to high redshift (z~7 or higher).
Surprisingly, it revealed a large variety in dust content already
established at high redshift: some galaxies are rich in dust but others are
extremely poor. This suggests that the early stages of galaxy evolution
present a large variety of physical conditions, driving galaxies along
different paths. The variety should also be related to the stellar
populations that we will observe with JWST, since metals, of which dust
grains are composed, originate from stars. Therefore, in order to
comprehend the evolution of the first galaxies, we need to undertake a
large panchromatic effort to fully understand the stellar, the gas, and the
dust content in high-redshift galaxies, rather than develop the models
separately as is often the case. This conference is suitable for these aims
because of the attendance of observers working at various wavelengths and
theoreticians working on the most advanced models of dust evolution and
SEDs.

The wavelength frontier.

The new X-ray missions e-ROSITA and Athena will bring far-reaching changes
to our understanding of black hole physics and AGN evolution over cosmic
time. In parallel the CTA is expanding our window on cosmic rays. At the
same time, MeerKAT is starting operations, VLASS will start soon all the
while the EVLA and LOFAR show excellent capabilities for deep fields. These
instruments will open new and unique opportunities to tackle the physics of
galaxies from star formation to quasars and active nuclei, while opening a
new window on the epoch of reionization. However, one of the main
challenges in order to tackle all these points will be to determine the
physical properties of galaxies through accurate SED modeling.
Historically, panchromatic models have only covered reliably the
electromagnetic spectrum from the ultraviolet to the sub-millimeter. The
loss of information in foregoing X-rays and radio wavelengths is damaging
to measure reliably the respective properties of host galaxies and AGN, as
nuclear activity and star formation can be difficult to disentangle
reliably. This conference will allow us to discuss state-of-the-art X-ray
and radio modeling of galaxies and the prospects of combining them with
standard panchromatic models.

The technical frontier.

LSST, Euclid, WFIRST and SKA will produce imaging and spectroscopic surveys
with observations of billions of galaxies, observed multiple times over
periods in excess of a decade, dwarfing the largest extragalactic surveys
to date that have been used in developing and applying modeling techniques.
The size and dimensionality of these data, combined with their limited
wavelength coverage, creates the need to rethink our panchromatic modeling
methods. This will require the community to focus its efforts on developing
new methods and techniques, such as machine learning, that utilize the
volume and diversity of the data rather than high signal-to-noise
measurements of small numbers of galaxies. In order to maximize the
information that can be extracted from these imaging surveys, experts in
the panchromatic modeling of galaxies need to engage with statisticians and
observers. This meeting will be an ideal platform from which to identify
the steps that need to be undertaken in this direction and to develop a
path towards the exploitation of this new generation of multispectral and
temporal surveys.

The meeting is will take place from 12 to 16 November 2018 at the =C5=8Csak=
a
University Conference Hall in Japan. =C5=8Csaka, is a large historic city o=
f
Japan with a rich intellectual life. It is tightly connected to the rest of
the world with direct flights from Asia, Europe, the Middle East, North
America, and Oceania. It it connected with T=C5=8Dky=C5=8D through a fast t=
rain,
offering even broader connections to the world.

*** ASIAA/NTU Joint Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Atsushi Taruya (YITP, Kyoto University)
Topic:         Relativistic effects on observed large-scale structure of the Universe
Time:         6/19 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         CCMS R104
Abstract:
The large-scale structure of the Universe observed via galaxy redshift surveys contains valuable cosmological information, and it has been playing a major role to improve our understanding of the Universe. However, ​the observed large-scale structure ​​appears distorted due to the observed ​​systematics in ​​the redshift determination, known as redshift-space distortions (RSD). Recently, the measurement of RSD is renewed with great interest as a probe of gravity on cosmological scales. In this talk, after reviewing the 'standard' RSD caused by the peculiar velocity of galaxies, I w​ill ​discuss yet another distortion arising from general relativistic effects. ​U​​nique feature of the​​ n​ew ​distortion e​ffects ​is demonstrated b​​​​ased on the simulated catalog taking a​ proper ​account of the relativistic effects,​ ​and detectability and implications to cosmology will be also discussed.

Speaker:    Atsushi Taruya (YITP, Kyoto University)
Topic:         Nonlinear structure formation in cold dark matter cosmology:  shell crossing and multi-stream flows
Time:         6/20 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
Invisible matter component called cold dark matter (CDM) is now widely accepted in cosmology as an essential building block of the cosmic structure formation. One important feature of CDM is that the phase-space velocity distribution was virtually null at very early time. This leads to, at later time, several interesting phenomena in nonlinear stage of gravitational dynamics: shell-crossing and multi-stream flow. In this talk, I will focus on these two phenomena, and discuss a way to describe quantitatively their phase-space structures, which is compared with state-of-the-art Vlasov-Poisson and cosmological N-body simulations.

Call for Proposal (2018-2019 term)

=20
We would like to call for proposals using TRAO (Taeduk Radio Astronomy =
Observatory) 14m telescope for the term of 2018 autumn to 2019 spring. =
Recently we successfully installed a multi-beam receiver system, =
SEQUOIA-TRAO, and renovated most part of the telescope system. The new =
receiver system is now equipped with high-performing 16-pixel MMIC =
preamplifiers in a 4x4 array, operating within 85-115.6 GHz frequency =
range. System temperature ranges from 170 K (86~110 GHz) to 400 K (115 =
GHz; 12CO). The 2nd IF modules with the narrow band and the 8 channels =
with 4 FFT spectrometers allow to observe 2 frequencies simultaneously =
within the 85~100 or 100~115 GHz bands for all 16 pixels of the =
receiver. OTF (On-The-Fly) mapping mode is the main observing mode, and =
a simple position switching mode is also available. OTF test observation =
shows that it takes 27 min for 6=E2=80=99x6=E2=80=99 region, and 37 min =
for 10=E2=80=99x10=E2=80=99. You may decide a regrid size and =
convolution parameter after completion of your observation. Pointing =
accuracy is about 6 acrsec. The backend system (FFT spectrometer) =
provides the 4096x2 channels with a fine velocity resolution of better =
than 0.05 km/s (15 kHz) per channel. Its effective spectra bandwidth is =
60 MHz.

There are three Key Science Programs (KSP) =
<http://radio.kasi.re.kr/trao/schedule.php> running for three years, =
abstracts of which are accessible at the TRAO home page.  Proposals =
which are not overlapped with KSPs are encouraged. Please refer the TRAO =
homepage for KSPs and other information. There are lots of telescope =
time avaliable between LST 10 and 15hrs, thus proposals using this time =
slots would have more privilege. Scientists, who did not have an =
observing experience at TRAO, are encouraged to have an internal =
collaborator(s) of KASI (Korea Astronomy and Space Science). The upper =
limit of telescope time per proposal is suggested as 100 hours. Two =
bedrooms and kitchen are available for outside observers. Deadline for =
proposal submission is August 31st 2018 (KST 23:59; UT+9). =20
