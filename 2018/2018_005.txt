Dear all,

We will have TTTT seminar on 16 Jan. in NTHU
given by Dr. Yu-Yen Chang.

Title:
SMG Structural Properties and NIR Morphologies

Speaker: Dr. Yu-Yen Chang
Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Academia Sinica

Time: 12:20pm 16th Jan. 2018 (Tuesday)

Venue: R501, IoA, 5th floor in the 2nd General Building

Abstract:
I will present the structural parameters and morphological properties
of faint 450 um selected submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) in the
COSMOS-CANDELS region. We investigate stellar structures of 174
faint 450 um sources at z<3 using HST near-infrared observations.
Based on our spectral energy distribution fitting, about half of such faint
SMGs lie above the main sequence, and half of them are on the main
sequence. The size-mass relation shows that these SMGs are generally
similar to star-forming galaxies. In general, 850 um sources are more
extended than 450 um sources, and 450 um sources are more extended
than normal galaxies. For the stellar mass and SFR matched sample, the
size differences are marginal between faint SMGs and the comparison
galaxies. However, faint SMGs have similar Sersic index and projected axis
ratio as star-forming galaxies with the same stellar mass and SFR at z~2.
Most SMGs (~80%) show disturbed features, but the fractions depend on
the SFR for both the SMGs and the comparison samples. Our results suggest
that galaxy merging is related to star formation activities, and the 
stellar
structures of SMGs are similar to those of star-forming galaxies.

With best regards,
Tetsuya
