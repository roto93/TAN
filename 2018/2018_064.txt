Topic:         Exploring the observational implications of supernova-driven turbulence with radiative transfer
Time:         5/9 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
A sizable work has been performed by examining the magnetic dynamo process of
supernova driven turbulence using kiloparsec scale MHD simulations. These
simulations were able to generate a self-consistent magnetic field structure
for the diffuse interstellar medium. In the recent work we have been able find
a way of comparing these supernova results with the Planck large-scale
polarization observations by using the radiative transfer tool SOC. This was
achieved by putting the observational point of view inside the kiloparsec scale
computational volume, creating a set synthetic all-sky maps from the MHD model.
From this these maps, we computed their polarization fractions and polarization
angle dispersion functions, averaged them into combined 2D-histograms, which
were used for comparison with the Planck results. We found that our
SN-turbulence simulation is able to produce comparable behavior to Planck, but
is limited by its spatial resolution and horizontal extent. We also note that
polarization does not directly correlate in any way with the supernova shocks.
Instead, they are connected with the small-scale magnetic fluctuations
generated by the SN-driven dynamo.
