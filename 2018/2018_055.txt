Dear radio astronomers, this is a reminder that the ALMA proposal deadline is 
less than 10 days away from now.  Donâ€™t miss it.  We will not call an SMA/ALMA
science meeting this week, so you can focus on the proposal.  We will make
announcements about ALMA or SMA through email, if anything relevant comes up.

Dear OIR/X/gamma/GW/theory astronomers, you are still encouraged to think about 
ALMA projects on your favorite targets.  There is still time to come up with a 
good proposal.  Our ALMA members will do our best to help you on the technical side.  
However, please act fast if you need any help, as we have our own proposals to take 
care as well.

Cheers,
Wei-Hao

Dear all,

    I would like to remind you that there is a major issue in the CASA 5.1 releases which seriously affects mosaic imaging of simulated data. 
    If simulated mosaic images obtained with CASA 5.1.* are included in your Cycle 6 proposal, please refer to the following knowledgeable article: 
    https://help.almascience.org/index.php?/Knowledgebase/Article/View/407

    Furthermore, there is a new rule in Cycle 6 --- the figure captions, tables and references included in the proposal Scientific Justification (SJ) must use a 12-point font
      (see Section 5.2.3 in https://almascience.nao.ac.jp/proposing/proposing/proposers-guide)
    If you plan to resubmit your previous cycle proposals, please do remember to change the font size in figure captions, tables and references.
    
best,
Yu-Nung
