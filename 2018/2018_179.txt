Dear Colleagues,
In the 2019 annual meeting of the Physical Society of Taiwan (NCTU, 
Hsinchu, Jan 23-25, 2019), in addition to the traditional 
astronomy/gravitation sessions, there is a topical symposium on Outer 
Space Exploration, hosted by NSPO. This symposium calls for oral and 
poster presentations. Some more descriptions can be found at
http://tps2019.conf.tw/site/mypage.aspx?pid=173&lang=en&sid=1235
You are all welcome to attend.

Second circular of SOKENDAI-UST Asia Winter School (SAWS) 2019:
"Star and Planet Formation: Key Questions and Challenges"
___________________________________________________________________

Title: SOKENDAI-UST Asia Winter School (SAWS) 2019
     Star and Planet Formation: Key Questions and Challenges

Web site: https://guas-astronomy.jp/eng/Applicants/winter2018.html

Date: February 27 to March 1, 2019
    - Lecture; 1.5 days
    - Group discussion; 0.5 days in daytime (+ extra nighttime)
    - Presentation; 0.5 days

Venue: Headquarters of the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan,
     Mitaka, Tokyo, Japan (https://www.nao.ac.jp/en/access/mitaka/)

Official language: English

Scientific Rationale: 
The research on star and planet formation has been growing very rapidly 
via ground-based and space-based programs in opt/IR and millimeter/submillimeter 
wavelengths and also via theoretical works. Furthermore, the research will 
be moving to a new era in the next decade with new telescopes, larger opt/IR 
telescopes such as TMT, and space telescopes such as JWST. 
This SAWS2019 provides opportunities to students from EA countries to stay 
at Mitaka in NAOJ and experiences to listen to a series of lectures and discuss 
on key questions, which are still unresolved and really essentials to unveil 
the mystery of star and planet formation. 
NAOJ is a central astronomical observatory in Japan and also a partner 
East Asia Core Observatory (EAO). NAOJ is operating the SUBARU telescope in 
Hawaii, joining international projects such as ALMA and East-Asian VLBI 
Network operation, and TMT construction. NAOJ is also engaged in fostering 
doctoral researchers in astronomy and planetary science as a part of SOKENDAI. 

Candidate Lecturers and topics:
- Observations of forming planets; Jun Hashimoto (ABC/NAOJ)
- Theory of planet formation: Eiichiro Kokubo (NAOJ/SOKENDAI),
  Yasunori Hori (ABC/NAOJ)
- Brown dwarf, IMF/CMF: Motohide Tamura (Univ. Tokyo/ABC/NAOJ)
- First core: Kengo Tomida (Osaka Univ.)
- Low-mass star-formation, outflow/jet: Naomi Hirano (ASIAA)
- Dust and polarization: Akimasa Kataoka (NAOJ/SOKENDAI)
- High-mass star-formation: Kee-Tae Kim (KASI/UST)
- First stars and metal/dust production in the Era of Reionization:
  Akio Inoue (Osaka Sangyo Univ.)
- Astrochemistry and astrobiology: Hideko Nomura (Tokyo Inst. Tech.)
- Future projects: Masao Saito (NAOJ/SOKENDAI), Paul T. P. Ho (EAO)

Format:
- Lecturers will review each topic and give key questions.
  Key scientific papers will be provided to students.
- Students will be divided into small groups to discuss each key
  question based on the papers, under supervision by lecturers
  and additional tutors.
- We would like to ask lecturers to help discussion if they
  are available. We will also ask local staff to help as tutors.
- The results of discussion will be presented in the last session.

Call for applicants:
About 40-50 will be accepted mainly from the MS/PhD students studying
in mainly East Asian region, and travel and hotel expenses are supported
(or offered) for students selected by SOC from SOKENDAI or UST.

*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:        Alex Heger (Monash)
Topic:          
Time:           11/7 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203


*** Special Seminar ***
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:        Arturo Manchado (Instituto de AstrofÃ­sica de Canarias)
Topic:          Nanostructures in evolved star
Time:           11/8 (Thursday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
The detections of fullerenes and (possibly) planar C24   
(a small fragment of a graphene sheet) in the H-rich circumstellar 
environments of evolved stars show that formation of these complex   
species does not require an H-poor environment contrary to general 
expectation. This together with the very recent identification of
the fullerene cation C 60+ as a diffuse interstellar band (DIB) carrier (the only DIB
carrier known to date) reinforce the idea that these molecular  nanostructures are
ubiquitous in space. The understanding of the formation route of these complex
organic species requires an interdisciplinary research, crossing the boundaries
between astronomers, chemists, and physicists, with potential applications in
nanotechnology and industry. 
Here, I review the main results of the interdisciplinary approach carried out at the
IAC in order to learn about complex molecular nanostructures in   evolved   stars.
In particular the spatial distribution of C60 in the planetary nebula IC 418.
Finally, I underline the main open questions and future directions like the expected
observations on these complex organics in evolved stars from future facilities such
as the James Webb Space Telescope.

I would appreciate it if you could circulate the call for proposal for ASTE telescope to TAN.

-------------------------------

Dear Tennet/Ryunet subscribers,

The Chile Observatory of the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ) solicits observing proposals for the Atacama Submillimeter Telescope Experiment (ASTE) telescope for the period June 1st to September 30th, 2019.   A total of ~200 hours is available in the LST range of 13 - 3 hours.

Note that the time available for this call for proposals is significantly reduced. This is because the projects which had lost time due to weather/instrumental problems during the 2017/2018 season are being carried over to 2019.

The deadline is December 4, 2018 (9:00 JST).

Please see

Dear all,

We will have TTTT seminar at NTHU on 7 Nov given by
Dr. Luis Alberto Diaz Garcia in Academia Sinica.

Title:Â  Stellar population and weak lensing studies
in large scale multi-filter surveys

Speaker: Dr. Luis Alberto Diaz Garcia

Time: 12:20-13:00pm 7th November (Wednesday)

Venue: R501, IoA, 5th floor in the 2nd General Building

Abstract: Nowadays, there is an increasing number of multi-filter surveys,
including COMBO-17, COSMOS, ALHAMBRA, CLASH, SHARDS, HSC-SSP,
J-PAS, J-PLUS, each of them with a vast volume of high-quality multi-filter
data. These kinds of surveys sample the spectral energy distributions (SED)
of all the sources in the field of view using top-hat and/or broad-band 
filters.
Owing to this configuration, the retrieved SEDs are half-way between 
classical
photometry and spectroscopy. This offers an opportunity to explore several
topics in Astronomy and Cosmology in an unprecedented way. After a brief
introduction of the main features of the ongoing ALHAMBRA, HSC-SSP,
J-PLUS, and J-PAS surveys, I will present how these surveys open a pathway
to advance in our understanding of galaxy evolution. More precisely, how
they can be used to explore the stellar content of quiescent galaxies from
the nearby Universe up to intermediate redshifts. Finally, I will 
briefly show
that studies involving both J-PAS and HSC-SSP photometric data can be
very fruitful and promising for future projects on weak lensing.

With best regards,
Tetsuya Hashimoto
