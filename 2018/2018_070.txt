Topic:         Debris dust as a tracer of planetary system architectures
Time:         5/23 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
Debris discs are tenuous rings of rock and ice around main sequence stars left over from planet formation processes. Their presence, most commonly inferred through the detection of excess emission at infrared wavelengths, is a signpost for the presence of a planetary system around the host star. At millimetre wavelengths, the dust emission is believed to closely trace the unseen belt of dust-producing planetesimals (asteroids and comets). Resolved imaging of debris discs at millimetre wavelengths reveals structures, e.g. azimuthal asymmetries, that can be linked to perturbation of the planetesimal belt by an unseen companion. Here I will present modelling of a sample of debris discs that have been observed at infrared and millimetre wavelengths in order to reveal the size scales of these systems as a function of the host stars' luminosities, and then used that as a ruler to interpret the emission from unresolved systems in order to identify potentially perturbed systems.
