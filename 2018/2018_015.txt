Speaker:    Richard Crutcher (University of Illinois)
Topic:         Magnetic Fields and Star Formation: Observations and Implications
Time:         2/5 (Monday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
Stars are a fundamental unit of the universe, and their formation is a fundamental astrophysical process. The role of magnetic fields in star formation remains controversial today. I will discuss several molecular cloud and star formation theoretical ideas that have very different roles for magnetic fields and describe techniques for observing magnetic fields in regions of star formation.  The talk will focus on the Zeeman effect, the only technique for directly observing magnetic field strengths. I will describe specific tests of vario Stars are a fundamental unit of the universe, and their formation is a fundamental astrophysical process.

chnique for directly observing magnetic field strengths. I will describe specific tests of various theories of the role of magnetic fields in star formation and the application of observational results in those tests. Finally, I will describe briefly a star formation scenario that meets all of the observational tests, and mention future observational opportunities.
