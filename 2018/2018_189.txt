Dear Yi-Jehng:

    Please help to distribute the announcement with TAN. Thanks.

 EAO Subaru Science Workshop 2019
 January 16(Wed) - 18(Fri) 2019
 KASI, Daejeon, South Korea

East Asian Observatory (EAO), led by 4 core institutions in East Asia
(NAOC in China, NAOJ in Japan, KASI in Korea, and ASIAA in Taiwan),
has been established in September 2012. EAO has been discussing
possible partnership with the Subaru Telescope since April 2016, and
now EAO aims to start actual partnership with the Subaru Telescope in
2019. One of basic important concept of the Subaru international
partnership is to share a part of the telescope time of the Subaru
Telescope to carry out group projects together under extensive
collaborations among users. In order to make such extensive
collaborations, it is extremely important for the EAO communities to
identify scientific areas for collaboration. The goal of the workshop
is to initiate discussions to start actual scientific collaborations
among the EAO communities.

The topics of this workshop covers all different fields of
astronomical research. The final goal is to form large Subaru programs
from EAO scientists. The organizing committee has invited speakers
from different institutes and universities in the EAO regions.
However, there are still slots for contributed talks. We encourage you
to check the details of the workshop in the following website and to
attend the workshop. See you in KASI.

Speaker:        Gabriel Torrealba (ASIAA)
Topic:          The discovery of the most diffuse galaxy in the Universe
Time:           11/19 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:           R1203


*** Special Seminar ***
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:        Joshua Yao-Yu Lin (UIUC)
Topic:          Hunting for dark matter substructure in Strong lensing with Neural networks
Time:           11/20 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Dark Matter Substructures are interesting since they can reveal the
properties of dark matter, especially the cold dark matter small-scale
problems such as missing satellites problem. In recent years, it has
become possible to detect individual dark matter subhalos near images
of strongly lensed extended background galaxies. In this talk, I would
discuss the possibility of using deep neural networks to detect
dark matter subhalos, and showing some preliminary result with simulated data.



*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:        Re'em Sari (Hebrew University of Jerusalem)
Topic:          Dynamics at the Galactic Center: Super Massive Black hole and Millions of Stars
Time:           11/21 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
The center of our galaxy hosts a super massive black hole, four millions times the mass of our own Sun. How did it came to be, and how does it influence our galaxy? Millions of stars orbit around it. What is their fate? Some explode dramatically when they get too close to the black hole, some get ejected from the galaxy at tremendous velocities and some get swallowed by the black hole. We discuss these processes, their rates at the galactic center and other galaxies and their connection with future detection of low frequency gravitational waves.



*** Special Seminar ***
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:        Jane Luu (MIT)
Topic:          'Oumuamua, an Interstellar Visitor
Time:           11/23 (Friday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
On October 19 2017, the Pan-STARRS telescope in Hawaii discovered an unusual fast moving object.  Given the name 'Oumuamua, the object was traveling on a hyperbolic orbit, which meant the object was not gravitationally bound to the Sun, but came from another planetary system.  The object soon returned to interstellar space after its brief visit.  This talk will describe what is remarkable (and unremarkable) about the object.

Would you please distribute this conference information to TAN?

-------- Forwarded Message --------

Dear colleagues,


     This message is to bring your attention to the conference titled 
"Linking the Milky Way and Nearby Galaxies:  The ISM and Star Formation 
from Cold Cores to kpc Scales" set to take place from 3-7 June 2019 in 
Helsinki,  Finland: 
https://www.helsinki.fi/en/conferences/linking-the-milky-way-and-nearby-galaxies


     The abstract submission deadline is 20 January 2019.  Please note 
that due to venue capacity, the conference is limited to 100 
participants.  Final selection will be based upon scientific 
contribution and on a "first come first served" basis for the 
registration. Abstract submission and pre-registration may be completed 
now.  Depending on final word from sponsors, the conference fee is 
expected to be between 200-300 euro.


Scientific Rationale:

       ISM and star-formation studies of the Milky Way and of nearby 
galaxies are being performed on progressively overlapping physical 
scales. This is a result of the increasing resolution of both 
simulations and observations. The gap between Galactic and extragalactic 
studies is bridged by facilities such as ALMA, GAIA, JVLA, MUSE, and the 
upcoming JWST.  Galaxy simulations begin to break-down when 
sub-cloud-scale physics are not included and, conversely, studies of the 
Milky Way star-formation often ignore the larger, galactic context. 
Thus, now is the time to facilitate discussion between the Galactic and 
nearby galaxy communities among theorists and observers alike.


     We would very much appreciate it if you could forward this 
information to those who may be interested!


On behalf of the LOC, best wishes!

Dear TW-ASTRO  Colleagues

Please take note of a colloquium event at the Institute of Physics, Academia Sin
ica, 
this Thurs. Nov 15 ,  2PM at the 1F Lecture Hall.

Dr. Haino will tell us about  both the AMS experiment at the Space Station (in w
hich IoP & Taiwan
has made major contributions in the past ~20 years)   and the KAGRA experiment i
n Japan 
(on an exciting and emerging subject of gravitational wave detection,  in which 
IoP is involved
with increasing intensity).

Refreshment will be served after the event.

It would be an illuminating lecture.  Please mark your calendar and join.

Best Regards
Henry Wong.

Academia Sinica Institute of Physics  ---   Colloquium Notice

Time/Venue : 2018/11/15(Thu)     14:00 -16:00    1st Floor(auditorium) 

Title     Exploring the Early Universe with Particles and Gravitational Waves
Speaker    Prof. Sadakazu Haino       ;   Institute of Physics, Academia Sinica.

Abstract

Since the detection of cosmic rays in 1912, major developments in particle physi
cs had been led by many discoveries of new particles in cosmic rays and even aft
er accelerators took over the frontiers, cosmic rays still remain to be an impor
tant field in particle physics and cosmology. Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) 
has revolutionized the measurement precision by 1 order of magnitude improvement
 and is charting new territory since the installation on the International Space
 Station in 2011.
 Recently, Gravitational Waves (GW) have been directly discovered 1 century afte
r the prediction by Einstein and they are expected to open a new window to explo
re the early Universe and test the General Relativity at extreme conditions. Lar
ge Cryogenic Gravitational-wave Telescope, also known as KAGRA is a Asian-based 
project to join the world wide GW detector network in the coming years.
 In my talk, I will introduce recent results and next steps of AMS, and current 
status and future prospects of KAGRA.
