Topic:          Large Scale Structureâ€”As a Probe for Cosmology
Time:           9/17 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
In this 101 level lunch talk, I will introduce how to combine theories on large scale structure and the Sunyaevâ€“Zel'dovich effect to constrain standard cosmology model. I will present the state-of-the-art cosmological constrains base on the SPT-selected clusters sample and discuss some future improvements through extra mass calibraters and enlarge SPT samples. Students with general interests in (observational) cosmology are especially welcome.

Topic:          Optimally Mapping Large-Scale Structures with Luminous Sources
Time:           9/18 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Intensity mapping has emerged as a promising tool to probe the three-dimensional structure of the Universe. The traditional galaxy surveys probe the large-scale structure based on individual galaxy detection, whereas intensity mapping uses the integrated emission from all sources in a 3D pixel (or voxel) to trace the underlying density field. In this work, We develop a formalism to quantify the performance of both approaches when measuring large-scale structures. We compute the Fisher information of an arbitrary observable, derive the optimal estimator, and use it to determine the best strategy for tracing large-scale density field for any given survey. In this talk, I will first give an overview of intensity mapping method, and then introduce the formalism and application of this technique.



*** Colloquium ***

Speaker:        Kuo-Chuan Pan (NTHU)
Topic:          Core-collapse supernovae: Explosion, neutron stars, black holes, and gravitational waves
Time:           9/19 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Supernovae are the spectacular birth places of neutron stars and stellar-mass black holes in the universe. In this talk, I will talk about the current challenges in supernova numerical modeling and the microphysics inside. In particular, I will focus on the supernova explosion mechanism, the formation of proto-neutron stars and stellar-mass black holes, and multi-messenger signals from core-collapse supernovae.
