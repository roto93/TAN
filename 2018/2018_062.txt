Abstract:
It is well accepted that the giant planets originated in a more compact, stable, and multi-resonant configuration due to interactions with the gas in the protoplanetary disk. Following the dispersal of the gas, the planets migrated to their current locations through 1) interactions with the planetesimal disk and 2) a dynamical instability during which two or more of the planets experienced mutual close encounters. The latter are necessary to account for the current orbital configuration of the planets. The exact dynamical mechanism which triggered the instability between the giants remains an open question. The currently favoured mechanism is the resonant crossing of one of the ice giants and Saturn. In this talk, I will introduce the state of the art in our understanding of this dynamical scenario. I will highlight successful aspects of the model. Namely, how it does extremely well in reproducing the orbital structure of the Solar System, and in particular, the Kuiper Belt.!
  I will discuss how dynamicists are progressing from using just the observed dynamical structures of the Kuiper Belt, but are now including compositional constraints in their models. In particular, I will focus on the Colours of the Outer Solar System Origins survey, or Col-OSSOS, and what Col-OSSOS revealed about the migrations of the gas-giants, and the compositional structure of the protoplanetary disc itself. 

Despite accounting for many of the properties of the current Solar System, the favoured dynamical scenario has two problematic requirements. Firstly, it demands an extremely compact initial resonant configuration. Secondly, it invokes the presence of a 5th gas-giant in the early Solar System, along with the implicit condition that the 5th planet is ejected! In the last part of my talk, I will present a new idea, the Grand Smack, in which the instability amongst the gas-giants is triggered by a large impact onto one of the 4 planets. Specifically, we demonstrate that the impact responsible for producing Uranus’s large obliquity is also sufficient to cause the system to go dynamically unstable. Our model can broadly account for all the major features of the Solar System’s dynamical architecture, including the relative locations of the gas-giants and their orbital excitations, the formation of the Kuiper Belt, and the preservation of the initial low dynamical excitation of !
the asteroid belt and the terrestrial planets. Critically, compared to models that invoke other instability mechanisms, a broader range of initial orbital configurations is able to reproduce the known Solar System. Our model’s strength is that it explains the overall architecture of the Solar System as the result of an event we know has happened - the tilting impact on to Uranus, rather than invoking the presence of a 5th planet.
