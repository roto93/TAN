Dear colleagues,

This is an announcement of a conference
*"Challenges in Panchromatic Galaxy Modelling with Next Generation Facilities"*.
held in Japan in November.

Regards,
Hiro

-----------------------------
IAU Symposium #341: PanModel2018:
*"Challenges in Panchromatic Galaxy Modelling with Next Generation
Facilities"*

*November 12 to 16, 2018 at Osaka University Hall*

https://panmodel2018.sciencesconf.org/

Registration will open in early April.

*Topics:*
Theme 1: Pushing the redshift frontier: modeling the first galaxies
Theme 2: Pushing the wavelength frontier: extending models towards X-rays
and radio
Theme 3: Pushing the technical frontier: from overwhelmingly large datasets
to machine learning

*Rationale:*
How galaxies form and evolve across cosmic times is one of the fundamental
questions in modern astrophysics. In this endeavor, the panchromatic
modeling of galaxies is one of the key tools. As new and next-generation
facilities progressively open a new era in astronomy we enter a new era
where our current approach at modeling the emission galaxies faces a triple
frontier.

*1) The redshift frontier.*
The first galaxies in the universe are still largely terra incognita. How
did the first stellar generations form? What are the properties of
population III stars and their effect on their environment? How are their
evolution and spectra affected by rotation and binarity? What can we tell
about their physical conditions (gas density, temperature, metallicity,
etc.) from the recombination line spectra? How did the dust form in such
extreme objects? Since its inception, ALMA has been providing excellent
opportunities for probing dust to high redshift (z~7 or higher).
Surprisingly, it revealed a large variety in dust content already
established at high redshift: some galaxies are rich in dust but others are
extremely poor. This suggests that the early stages of galaxy evolution
present a large variety of physical conditions, driving galaxies along
different paths. The variety should also be related to the stellar
populations that we will observe with JWST, since metals, of which dust
grains are composed, originate from stars. Therefore, in order to
comprehend the evolution of the first galaxies, we need to undertake a
large panchromatic effort to fully understand the stellar, the gas, and the
dust content in high-redshift galaxies, rather than develop the models
separately as is often the case. This conference is suitable for these aims
because of the attendance of observers working at various wavelengths and
theoreticians working on the most advanced models of dust evolution and
SEDs.

*2) The wavelength frontier.*
The new X-ray missions e-ROSITA and Athena will bring far-reaching changes
to our understanding of black hole physics and AGN evolution over cosmic
time. In parallel the CTA is expanding our window on cosmic rays. At the
same time, MeerKAT is starting operations, VLASS will start soon all the
while the EVLA and LOFAR show excellent capabilities for deep fields. These
instruments will open new and unique opportunities to tackle the physics of
galaxies from star formation to quasars and active nuclei, while opening a
new window on the epoch of reionization. However, one of the main
challenges in order to tackle all these points will be to determine the
physical properties of galaxies through accurate SED modeling.
Historically, panchromatic models have only covered reliably the
electromagnetic spectrum from the ultraviolet to the sub-millimeter. The
loss of information in foregoing X-rays and radio wavelengths is damaging
to measure reliably the respective properties of host galaxies and AGN, as
nuclear activity and star formation can be difficult to disentangle
reliably. This conference will allow us to discuss state-of-the-art X-ray
and radio modeling of galaxies and the prospects of combining them with
standard panchromatic models.

*3) The technical frontier. *
LSST, Euclid, WFIRST and SKA will produce imaging and spectroscopic surveys
with observations of billions of galaxies, observed multiple times over
periods in excess of a decade, dwarfing the largest extragalactic surveys
to date that have been used in developing and applying modeling techniques.
The size and dimensionality of these data, combined with their limited
wavelength coverage, creates the need to rethink our panchromatic modeling
methods. This will require the community to focus its efforts on developing
new methods and techniques, such as machine learning, that utilize the
volume and diversity of the data rather than high signal-to-noise
measurements of small numbers of galaxies. In order to maximize the
information that can be extracted from these imaging surveys, experts in
the panchromatic modeling of galaxies need to engage with statisticians and
observers. This meeting will be an ideal platform from which to identify
the steps that need to be undertaken in this direction and to develop a
path towards the exploitation of this new generation of multispectral and
temporal surveys.

The meeting is will take place from 12 to 16 November 2018 at the =C5=8Csak=
a
University Conference Hall in Japan. =C5=8Csaka, is a large historic city o=

America, and Oceania. It it connected with T=C5=8Dky=C5=8D through a fast t=

Topic:         Observational study of evolution from formation of protostellar disks to formation of planets
Time:         2/26 (Monday) 11:00 - 12:00
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
Protoplanetary disks, the sites of planet formation, are often observed around young stellar objects. However, it remains unclear as to how and when such disks form during the process of star formation, and whether they possess forming planets or not. Formation and evolution of disks are closely related to angular momentum transfer from their parental dense cores to the vicinity of protostars under the influence of the magnetic field. In this presentation, I will introduce my project aiming to link the analyses of the gas kinematics and the magnetic field in protostellar sources in order to understand the role of the magnetic field in disk formation and evolution. In addition, the gas kinematics in protoplanetary disks can exhibit signatures of dynamical interaction between planets and disks, and thus it can be a signpost of forming planets. In this presentation, I will also introduce my project of searching for planets embedded in protoplanetary disks by detecting signature!
s induced by disk-planet interaction.
