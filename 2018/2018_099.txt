With the release of CASA 5.3 =
<https://casa.nrao.edu/casa_obtaining.shtml> the first experimental VLBI =
tools will be included in the package (see the latest CASA Newsletter =
<https://science.nrao.edu/enews/casa_006/> for more details). With =
support from  IAA-CSIC <https://www.iaa.csic.es/>, JIVE =
<http://www.jive.eu/> is organising an afternoon tutorial to introduce =
these new tools to the EVN community, which will take place at the end =
of the EVN symposium <http://evnsymp2018.iaa.es/> in Granada, Spain.

Date & time: October 11, 15:30 =E2=80=93 18:30=E2=80=A8
Location: IAA-CSIC, Glorieta de la Astronm=C3=ADa s/n, C.P. 18008, =
Granada, Spain =20

The first part of the tutorial consists of a lecture to demonstrate how =
to calibrate an EVN Network Monitoring Experiment in CASA, starting from =
the data stored in the EVN archive. The second part allows participants =
to try this for themselves, or attempt to calibrate a small dataset of =
their own. A few scans on a bright source are sufficient, given the =
available time.=20

All participants should bring their own laptop with a working CASA 5.3 =
installation. Prior experience with CASA is not necessary, though for =
new CASA users it is recommended to work through one of the JVLA =
CASA=C2=A0tutorials =
<https://casaguides.nrao.edu/index.php/Karl_G._Jansky_VLA_Tutorials> =
prior to attending the workshop.

Interested participants are requested to sign up beforehand =
<https://goo.gl/forms/kLj4qFxeMWeatMyl1>. Registration before 15 =
September is recommended to ensure a seat. After that date, details on =
the tutorial will be provided only to registered participants.=20

Please contact me if you require more information.

Kind regards,
Ilse van Bemmel
