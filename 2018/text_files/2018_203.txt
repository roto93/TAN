Topic:          Searching for  Intraday Variability of QSOs using High-Cadence Wide-Field Survey
Time:           12/17 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Investigation of variability is a powerful tool to understand the nature and process in the inner nuclear regions of AGNs. Variability can range time scales from intraday to years. However, variability on intraday timescales in AGNs is puzzled. Mechanisms for intraday variability include shock-in-jets models and instabilities of accretion disks. To extend the sample of AGN with intraday variability, we searched for intraday variability in ~3600 QSOs using high-cadence (20 mins) data of PTF/iPTF survey. I will present current preliminary results and status. Also, I will introduce future plans of using Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF)  data with a 47 square degree field of view (,and LSST) for this project.

Speaker:        Benjamin Horowitz (UC Berkeley)
Topic:          Optimal Reconstruction of Cosmological Density Fields: Examples from Lyman Alpha Forest Tomography and Weak Lensing
Time:           12/20 (Thursday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
In this talk I will discuss recent and ongoing work on reconstructing density fields from cosmological observations. Starting with a toy example to establish the maximum likelihood formalism, I will then apply it to three dimensional intergalactic medium (IGM) interpreted from lyman alpha absorption lines in the spectra of high redshift sources. Unlike standard galaxy redshift surveys which can trace the nearby universe (z<0.2), IGM tomography provides accurate maps at ``Cosmic Noon'' (z~2.0), capturing galaxies at a critical early time in their formation. By utilizing a maximum likelihood approach, I show that it is possible to reconstruct the initial density field of observed regions and potentially provide a new probe of astrophysical processes. Time permitting, I will discuss applying these techniques to galaxy weak lensing surveys where they can be used to optimally extract cosmological information even in the presence of severe instrumental systematics.

Speaker:        A. Gopakumar (Tata Institute of Fundamental Research)
Topic:          Blazar OJ287 and its nano-Hertz GW emitting massive BH binary central engine
Time:           12/21 (Friday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Blazars are active galactic nuclei with strong jets. They tend to
exhibit dramatic and unpredictable flux variations, namely
outbursts.Certain observed outbursts from an exceptional Blazar OJ287
can be explained by invoking a massive  black hole binary as its
central engine. Detailed General Relativistic modeling allowed us to
predict a major optical outburst during November 2015. The outburst
did occur within the expected time range, peaking on 5/12/2015. A
multi-wavelength observational campaign confirmed the  occurrence of
certain impact flare and the presence of a major thermal component in
the flare, as predicted. These observations and subsequent analysis
allowed us to establish the presence of a spinning supermassive black
hole binary that spirals in due to the emission of nano-Hertz
gravitational waves in the central engine of OJ287.
I will  briefly list our on-going efforts that should be interesting
to the Event Horizon Telescope consortium and the International Pulsar
Timing Array.

Dear Yi-Jehng,

The SMA call for large scale and standard project proposals for the
2019A semester has been announced. I would appreciate it if you 
could circulate this to TAN.

Regards,
Naomi

SMA Call for Large Scale and Standard Projects Proposals â€“ 2019A Semester
Mark Gurwell (Chair, Submillimeter Array Time Allocation Committee)

We wish to draw your attention to the Large Scale Projects program for observations with the Submillimeter Array (SMA), which is now accepting Notices of Intent to propose. Under this program, proposals dedicated to answering major astrophysical questions having significant scientific impact requiring observing times of order 100-1000 hours are solicited. In this communication, we are also pre-announcing the dates for standard observing proposals. These calls are for the 2019A semester with observing period 16 May 2019 â€“ 15 Nov 2019.

Large Scale Project Proposals
        â€¢     Notice of Intent (required): 10 January 2019
        â€¢     Proposal submission deadline: 07 February 2019 

Standard Observing Proposals
        â€¢     Proposal submission deadline : 07 March 2019

The SMA is a reconfigurable interferometric array of eight 6-m antennas on Maunakea jointly built and operated by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory and the Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics. The array operates in the 230, 345 and 400 GHz bands, observing simultaneously with two orthogonally polarized receivers, one in the 230 GHz or 345 GHz band and the other in the 240 GHz or 400 GHz band (with full polarimetric observations available using the 230+240 or 345+400 band combinations). The SWARM correlator processes 8 GHz bandwidth for each receiver in each sideband, for a total of 32 GHz, at a uniform 140 kHz resolution. This 32 GHz frequency coverage can be continuous where the tuning ranges overlap for the two orthogonally polarized receivers.   The SMA provides flexible, wide band frequency coverage that delivers high continuum sensitivity and excellent spectral line capabilities. A full transit observation offers continuum sensitivity of 250 !
 or 600 micro-Jy (1 sigma) at 230 or 345 GHz in good weather conditions (precipitable water vapor 2.5mm and 1.0mm, respectively). The corresponding line sensitivities at 1 km/s resolution are 35 and 80 mJy. The small antennas allow access to low spatial frequencies in the sub-compact configuration, and at the other extreme, the finest angular resolution with the very extended configuration at 345 GHz is ~ 0.25". The compact and extended configurations complete the range. The characteristics and performance of the SMA are both similar and complementary to those of the stand-alone Atacama Compact Array (ACA) component of ALMA. For more information about SMA capabilities, visit the SMA Observer Center website and explore the set of SMA proposing tools. Current and archived SMA Newsletters provide a sampling of the wide variety of science possible with the SMA.
The Large Scale Projects program follows a phased development, submission and review path, with the final selection of successful proposals synchronized with the TAC process for regular proposals. Accordingly, a Notice of Intent is required ahead of full submission.
A second announcement will be circulated when the standard proposal system opens for submissions. We expect that to occur in mid-January.
For more details visit the following websites:
        â€¢     General
        â€¢     Large Scale Projects
        â€¢     Notice of Intent
Questions or comments regarding the Call for Large Scale Proposals can be addressed to sma-largescale@cfa.harvard.edu and on standard proposals to sma-proposal@cfa.harvard.edu.
