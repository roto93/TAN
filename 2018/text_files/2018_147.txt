Dear ALMA users,

We invite you to send your rejected Cy6 ALMA proposals to us for a second review.
We will send your proposals to local experts for review, and then provide you detailed
review reports.

The reason for this is that the ALMA proposal reviewers have many proposals to read in
a short period.  This leaves them very little time to provide detailed comments in the
review report.  They usually just pick one or two major weaknesses and write them in the
report.  If you just follow the review report and address these one or two weaknesses in 
your Cy7 proposal, it is possible that the revised proposal is still not good enough.

To remedy this, and to help you to improve your Cy6 proposals for Cy7, we form a team
of local reviewers who are willing to give you detailed comments. We hope this can better
prepare you for Cy7.  If you intend to write a Cy7 proposal that is similar to your Cy6 one,
we strongly encourage you to send your rejected Cy6 proposal to us.

The deadline is Oct 5.  We plan to provide the review reports to you in early November.

Please also feel free to ask me if you have any questions about this process.  This is not
an official review.  So many things can be flexible.

Cheers,
Wei-Hao
