Dear colleagues,

    Please find below the information about the conference "Cosmic Cycle of Dust and Gas in the Galaxy: from Old to Young Stars” in coming July. This is one of the big series of meetings held in Vietnam in recent years. Note that the deadline for early bird registration is coming in a few days on May 31th.

best,

—————————————— 

The registration for the conference Cosmic Cycle of Dust and Gas in the Galaxy: from Old to Young Stars -July 9th to July 13th, 2018- is now open. The conference will take place at the International Center for Interdisciplinary Science and Education (ICISE) which is located in the beautiful coastal city of Quy Nhon, Vietnam. You are invited to register and submit contributed talks and posters.

Organized in the framework of the "Rencontres du Vietnam", the conference focuses on the evolution of dust and gas from evolved to young stars. The aim of the conference is to bring astronomers working on the circumstellar environment of evolved stars and star forming regions and planetologists working on the origin of the solar system together to discuss about science in a friendly and relaxed environment at ICISE. In July 2016, in the same cycle of conferences, “Blowing In the Wind” addressed issues of dynamics of gas and dust in the Galaxy. In July 2017, another conference “Star Formation in Different Environments” focused on how stars form. This year's conference will be dedicated to the physico-chemistry and evolution of gas and dust. It will review state-of-the-art knowledge of the molecular and dust components of envelopes and shells surrounding AGB stars, planetary nebulae, diffuse giant molecular clouds as well as Supernovae. Special sessions will be dedicat!
ed to the origin and evolution of matter in the solar system: meteorites, comets, etc. Recent observations, in particular with ALMA, are the source of major progress in the study of the cosmic cycle of gas and dust in the Galaxy making such a conference very timely.

The list of invited speakers can be found at: https://cosmiccycle2018.sciencesconf.org/resource/page/id/6


Bootcamp: 

During the weekend before the conference, we organize a series of tutorials and lectures introducing the topics of the conference to senior undergraduates, PhD students and young postdocs. If you are interested in attending it, please contact Tuan-Anh Pham (ptanh@vnsc.org.vn).
