Dear colleagues,

This is a reminder that the final registration deadline for this year's 
TIARA Summer School is this *Friday June 15*. If you'd like to have 
lunch boxes and/or attend the conference dinner, then please register. 
However, the school is open to all so registration is not necessary for 
attending the talks. We encourage you and your students to attend.

Thanks very much,

Min-Kai & LOC
