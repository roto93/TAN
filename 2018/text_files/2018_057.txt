Call for Proposals 2018B (KVN VLBI)
-------------------------------------------------

The Korean VLBI Network (KVN, http://kvn.kasi.re.kr) invites scientific
proposals for VLBI observations during the 2018B season from astronomers
around the world. Observations of successful proposals will be scheduled
between 15th August 2018 and 15th January 2019. Proposals should be emailed

Korean VLBI Network (KVN)
The Korean VLBI Network (KVN) is a dedicated mm-VLBI network, operated by
the Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute (KASI, http://www.kasi.re.kr).
Its three 21m radio telescopes are located around South Korea in Seoul,
Ulsan, and Jeju Island. The baseline lengths ranges from 305km to 476 km.
Its 4-channel receiving system allows simultaneous observation at 22, 43,
86, and 129 GHz. Higher than 1 Gbps recording rates (2, 4 and 8 Gbps) using
Mark6 recorder are available. Total machine time of 300 hours are planned
for this call. The maximum observation time of a proposal will be limited
to 100 hours. If requested in the proposals, the observation time can be
allocated over a year, until June 15, 2019, but the observation time will
not be increased. Details of the information and current status of the KVN
can be found in the KVN VLBI Status Report  (
https://radio.kasi.re.kr/kvn/status_report_2018/array.html).

Proposers should use the KVN VLBI observing application form (the .tex file
can be found at http://kvn.kasi.re.kr/index.html/obs_proposal.php). Please
carefully follow the instructions of the proposal form. A separate
scientific and technical justification is mandatory. This Justification
should be submitted together with the proposal form and not exceed 3 pages.
