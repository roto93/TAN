Dear radio astronomers, this is a reminder that the ALMA proposal deadline is 
less than 10 days away from now.  Donâ€™t miss it.  We will not call an SMA/ALMA
science meeting this week, so you can focus on the proposal.  We will make
announcements about ALMA or SMA through email, if anything relevant comes up.

Dear OIR/X/gamma/GW/theory astronomers, you are still encouraged to think about 
ALMA projects on your favorite targets.  There is still time to come up with a 
good proposal.  Our ALMA members will do our best to help you on the technical side.  
However, please act fast if you need any help, as we have our own proposals to take 
care as well.

Cheers,
Wei-Hao
