Title: Theoretical modeling of dust evolution in galaxies

Speaker: Prof. Hiroyuki Hirashita (平下博之)

Time: 12:20-13:00pm 11th July (Wednesday) 

Venue: R501, IoA, 5th floor in the 2nd General Building 

Abstract: The evolution of dust in the interstellar medium is one of 
the most important aspects in galaxy evolution. For the evolution of 
dust, it is important to clarify the dust amount and the dust properties 
(especially the grain size distribution). We modeled the evolution of 
these two aspects in a consistent framework and proposed the following 
dust evolution scenario: Dust formation in stellar ejecta is important for 
the dust enrichment in the early stage of galaxy evolution or in the 
metal-poor phase. The subsequent evolutions of dust amount and grain 
size distribution are governed by interstellar processing of dust. Especially, 
grain disruption by shattering and dust growth by accretion enhance the 
abundance of small grains while coagulation pushes those created small 
grains to large sizes. We also show that the above processes governing 
dust evolution have a variety of impacts on some observable quantities 
such as extinction curves. I also talk about our recent efforts of 
implementing the above dust evolution processes into hydrodynamical 
galaxy evolution simulations. We have recently implemented dust evolution 
into a cosmological simulation, based on which we are able to predict the 
dust evolution over a cosmological time and volume.

With best regards,
Tetsuya Hashimoto
