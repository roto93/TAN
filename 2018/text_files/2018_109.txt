Speaker:    Kate Pattle (NTHU)
Topic:        First measurements of the magnetic field strength in the Pillars of Creation
Time:        7/23 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:          R1203
Abstract:
In this talk I will present the first high-resolution, submillimetre-wavelength, polarimetric observations of - and thus direct observations of the magnetic field morphology within - the dense gas of the Pillars of Creation in M16. These recent results from the JCMT BISTRO (B-fields in Star-forming Region Observations) survey show that the magnetic field runs along the length of these photo-ionized columns, perpendicular to, and decoupled from, the field in the surrounding photoionized cloud.  I will discuss estimation of the magnetic field strength in the columns, and its implications for the formation of the Pillars. I will further discuss the energy balance in the Pillars, and hypothesize on the effect of the magnetic field on the future evolution and lifetime of the Pillars.

Speaker:    Yongzhong Qian (University of Minnesota)
Topic:        Our Solar System: What Triggered Its Formation?
Time:        7/25 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:          R1203
Abstract:
About 4.6 billion years ago, some event disturbed a cloud of gas and dust, triggering the gravitational collapse that led to the formation of the solar system. One hypothesis is that a nearby supernova - a star exploding at the end of its life cycle - initiated this event. My collaborators and I have examined why earlier forensic evidence based on studies of extinct radioactive nuclei in meteorites have been inconclusive, and shown how recent results from modeling supernovae and their impact on star formation have opened up new directions in researching the formation of our solar system.
