LSST@Asia: Exploring the Wide, Fast, Deep Universe

***************************************************************************

Registration is now open for the LSST@Asia: Exploring the Wide, Fast,
Deep Universe conference (https://lsst-asia.org) to be held in Sydney,
Australia, 20-23 May 2019.

LSST@Asia is the first conference in what we intend to be a series,
following on from the series of very successful LSST@Europe
conferences held in 2013, 2016 and 2018. These meetings encouraged
close interaction between LSST personnel and European scientists
interested in LSST.

LSST@Asia will bring together scientists in Asia, Australia and South
Africa with an interest in the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope and
provide them with the opportunity to interact with each other as well
as with leaders of the LSST Science Collaborations and hear updates on
LSST construction and data processing progress.

The main objectives of the 2019 meeting are to:

    -Provide an update on the status of the LSST Project
    -Strengthen the network of scientists in Asia involved in various
aspects of LSST
    -Promote increased engagement of scientists with the LSST Science
Collaborations
    -Explore synergies with future astronomical facilities

Child care will be provided to maximise participation by those with
carer responsibilities. There will also be some funding support
available to encourage attendance by early-career researchers (<5
years post PHD) and PhD students.
