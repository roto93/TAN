> To: undisclosed-recipients:;

Dear colleagues,

After the overwhelming response for proposed contributed talks for the =
EVN Symposium 2018 that we had (with 127 abstracts submitted plus 30 =
posters), we expect to have a very stimulating meeting with over 200 =
people attending the Symposium.

An UPDATED PROGRAM of the Symposium, now including the titles of the =
talks (and soon the links to the abstracts), can be found here =
<http://evnsymp2018.iaa.es/content/preliminary-program>.

Please, note that the DEADLINE for REGISTRATION at REDUCED FEE is the =
next 3rd of August, 2018. Registration may be formalized though this web =
form <http://evnsymp2018.iaa.es/content/registration>.

We highly recommend to BOOK YOUR ACCOMMODATION at your earliest =
convenience following our recommendations here =
<http://evnsymp2018.iaa.es/content/accommodation>. Besides the fact that =
Granada is a very touristic destination, during the dates of the EVN =
Symposium there will be a much larger medical conference in the city =
expecting ~2000 attendees. This may make difficult to find accommodation =
in the last minute.

The deadline for APPLICATION for FUNDING SUPPORT by RadioNet has also =
been set on the 3rd of August, 2018. Application for funding support can =
be made during the registration process.

Please, find bellow an updated reproduction of the 3rd Announcement of =
the Symposium.

With best regards,

    Ivan Agudo=20

  -Starburst galaxies, extragalactic masers, and supernovae
  -Stellar evolution and stellar masers
  -Transient sources and pulsars
  -Astrometric, geodetic & space applications
  -VLBI technology developments
  -Users feedback
  -Current and future VLBI facilities and international cooperation

Moreover, the meeting WILL ALSO FOCUS on the role of EVN on:

    - Very-high sensitivity VLBI with SKA
    - Future multi-wavelength and multi-messenger astronomy including =
high angular-resolution astronomy at other wavelengths
