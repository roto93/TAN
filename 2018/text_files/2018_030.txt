Dear all,

We will have TTTT seminar in NTHU on 12 March given by
Dr. Chiu I-Non, who is a postdoc in Academia Sinica.

Title: Studying Scaling Relations of Galaxy Clusters

Speaker: Dr. Chiu I-Non (邱奕儂)

Time: 12:20-13:00pm 12th Mar. (Monday)

Venue: R501, IoA, 5th floor in the 2nd General Building

Abstract:
Galaxy clusters contain rich information of cosmology and astrophysics.
In the past, cluster science was limited by a lack of adequately deep
observations in multi-wavelength and was subject to heterogeneous
samples with small sizes at low redshift. The situation has been changed
due to the recent success of the large mm wavelength surveys—such as
the South Pole Telescope (SPT)—that employ the Sunyaev-Zel’dovich Effect
(SZE) to identify and study galaxy clusters in their abundance out to the
early and distant Universe. Together with the breakthroughs in the area
of wide-and-deep optical and NIR surveys, such as the Dark Energy Survey
and the Hyper Suprime-Cam survey, we are able to uniformly study these
SZE selected samples. In this talk, I will talk about the recent results 
from
the various large cluster surveys with emphasis on various observable to
mass scaling relations. I will demonstrate the crucial need for the 
accurate
mass calibration in order to pave a way for cluster science in the future.

Regards,
Tetsuya
