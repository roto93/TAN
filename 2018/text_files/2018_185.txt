Dear Yi-Jehng:

    Please help to distribute the announcement with TAN. Thanks.

 EAO Subaru Science Workshop 2019
 January 16(Wed) - 18(Fri) 2019
 KASI, Daejeon, South Korea

East Asian Observatory (EAO), led by 4 core institutions in East Asia
(NAOC in China, NAOJ in Japan, KASI in Korea, and ASIAA in Taiwan),
has been established in September 2012. EAO has been discussing
possible partnership with the Subaru Telescope since April 2016, and
now EAO aims to start actual partnership with the Subaru Telescope in
2019. One of basic important concept of the Subaru international
partnership is to share a part of the telescope time of the Subaru
Telescope to carry out group projects together under extensive
collaborations among users. In order to make such extensive
collaborations, it is extremely important for the EAO communities to
identify scientific areas for collaboration. The goal of the workshop
is to initiate discussions to start actual scientific collaborations
among the EAO communities.

The topics of this workshop covers all different fields of
astronomical research. The final goal is to form large Subaru programs
from EAO scientists. The organizing committee has invited speakers
from different institutes and universities in the EAO regions.
However, there are still slots for contributed talks. We encourage you
to check the details of the workshop in the following website and to
attend the workshop. See you in KASI.
