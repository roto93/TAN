Title: SOKENDAI-UST Asia Winter School (SAWS) 2019
      Star and Planet Formation: Key Questions and Challenges

Web site: https://guas-astronomy.jp/eng/Applicants/winter2018.html =
<https://guas-astronomy.jp/eng/Applicants/winter2018.html>

Date: February 27 to March 1, 2019
     - Lecture; 1.5 days
     - Group discussion; 0.5 days in daytime (+ extra nighttime)
     - Presentation; 0.5 days

Venue: Headquarters of the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan,
      Mitaka, Tokyo, Japan (https://www.nao.ac.jp/en/access/mitaka/ =
<https://www.nao.ac.jp/en/access/mitaka/>)

Official language: English

Scientific Rationale:
 The research on star and planet formation has been growing very
rapidly via ground-based and space-based programs in opt/IR and
millimeter/submillimeter wavelengths and also via theoretical works.
Furthermore, the research will be moving to a new era in the next
decade with new telescopes, larger opt/IR telescopes such as TMT,
and space telescopes such as JWST.
 This SAWS2019 provides opportunities to students from EA countries
to stay at Mitaka in NAOJ and experiences to hear a series of lectures
and discuss on key questions, which are still unresolved and really
essentials to unveil the mystery of star and planet formation.
 NAOJ is a central astronomical observatory in Japan and also a partner
East Asia Core Observatory (EAO). NAOJ is operating the SUBARU telescope =
in Hawaii, joining international projects such as ALMA and East-Asian
VLBI Network operation, and TMT construction. NAOJ is also engaged in
fostering doctoral researchers in astronomy and planetary science as
a part of SOKENDAI.

Candidate Lecturers and topics:
 - Observations of forming planets; Jun Hashimoto (ABC/NAOJ)
 - Theory of planet formation: Eiichiro Kokubo (NAOJ/SOKENDAI),
   Yasunori Hori (ABC/NAOJ)
 - Brown dwarf, IMF/CMF: Motohide Tamura (Univ. Tokyo/ABC/NAOJ)
 - First core: Kengo Tomida (Osaka Univ.)
 - Low-mass star-formation, outflow/jet: Naomi Hirano (ASIAA)
 - Dust and polarization: Akimasa Kataoka (NAOJ/SOKENDAI)
 - High-mass star-formation: Kee-Tae Kim (KASI/UST)
 - First stars and metal/dust production in the Era of Reionization:
   Akio Inoue (Osaka Sangyo Univ.)
 - Astrochemistry and astrobiology: Hideko Nomura (Tokyo Inst. Tech.)
 - Future projects: Masao Saito (NAOJ/SOKENDAI), Paul T. P. Ho (EAO)

Format:
 - Lecturers will review each topic and give key questions.
   Key scientific papers will be provided to students.
 - Students will be divided into small groups to discuss each key
   question based on the papers, under supervision by lecturers
   and additional tutors.
 - We would like to ask lecturers to help discussion if they
   are available. We will also ask local staff to help as tutors.
 - The results of discussion will be presented in the last session.

Call for applicants:
 About 40-50 will be accepted mainly from the MS/PhD students studying
in mainly East Asian region, and travel and hotel expenses are supported
(or offered) for students selected by SOC from SOKENDAI or UST.
