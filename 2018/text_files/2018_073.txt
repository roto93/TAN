Dear colleagues,

This is a reminder of an upcoming deadline for the TIARA Summer School 
on the Origins of the Solar System. Students coming from outside of 
Taipei City and wishing to apply for lodging support, please register by 
*May 31*. Note that we can only provide a limited number of lodging 
support.

The final deadline for the registration is *June 15*.

The school is limited to about 60 registered participants, but the 
lectures will be open for all interested to attend. You are encouraged 
to do so.

Cheers,

Min-Kai & LOC
