Postdoctoral Positions in Observation, Theory, or Instrumentation at ASIAA

http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/jobopening/ad.php?i=affba631db0c53b327371257bb12d2aa

The Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA) in
Taipei, Taiwan, has openings for postdoctoral positions. We seek for
candidates (1) to participate in the Institute's projects, including
ALMA, SMA, JCMT, Greenland telescope (GLT), intensity mapping with
Y.T. Lee Array, Subaru HSC and PFS surveys, SDSS-IV, and TAOS-2; (2)
to pursue studies of planetary and solar system science, star and
planet formation, nearby galaxies, galaxy formation, cosmology,
computational fluid dynamics, MHD, and high energy astrophysics; or
(3) to participate in instrumentation development for optical/IR/submm
telescopes.

ASIAA has approximately 200 staff, including 38 faculty members. ASIAA
has access to forefront observing facilities including ALMA, SMA,
JCMT, CFHT, and Subaru Telescope. We are partners in the Subaru Hyper
Suprime-Cam (HSC) and Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS) projects, and are
a member of the SDSS-IV, CFHT-SPIRou, and LSST Surveys. The Y.T. Lee
Array on Mauna Loa is conducting intensity mapping of CO rotational
transitions. The GLT has recently started submm VLBI observations to
image shadows of supermassive black holes and related sciences. The
TAOS-2 project will start a survey of small objects beyond Neptune via
occultation and other time-domain sciences at San Pedro Martir,
Mexico. Theoretical and computational astrophysics is pursued in the
Theory group (TIARA); we develop theory and numerical simulations to
bridge theories and observations in hydrodynamics, astrochemistry, and
radiative transfer. More info on our projects can be found at the
ASIAA website.

ASIAA offers excellent research facilities and an international
environment (~50 foreign members from 18 countries), with English
being the working language. The postdoc appointments will initially be
for two years, with possible extension for additional two years based
on satisfactory performance.

Applicants should hold a Ph.D. degree in astronomy/astrophysics,
physics, engineering or equivalent fields. Those who are expecting to
receive a PhD degree soon can also apply. Applicants should apply
online (https://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/jobopening/application.php?i=affba631db0c53b327371257bb12d2aa)
and submit (1) a curriculum vitae, (2) a publication list, (3) a
summary of past and current research or instrumentation experience
(limited to 3 pages), and (4) a plan for future research (limited to 3
pages of text, with at most 2 additional pages for figures and
references).  Applicants are also requested to arrange three letters
of recommendation to be submitted online at the same site by the
deadline, 16 November 2018.

*/Exploring the Infrared Universe: The Promise of SPICA/*

Crete, Greece

20-23 May 2019

http://www.spica2019.org/

*Deadline for abstracts: 2018 December 1*

*
*

We now invite the community to submit abstracts for contributed talks 
and posters for the conference "Exploring the Infrared Universe: The 
Promise of SPICA". We welcome contributions with clear connections to 
SPICA, and are very interested in contributions that can help to 
finalize the design of SPICA,and to strengthen or augment the SPICA 
science case.

**

*Science rationale:*

The infrared wavelength range is key to understand the origin and 
evolutionof galaxies, stars and planetary systems, which are obscured by 
dust during a large part of their life cycles. With a large cold mirror 
and a sensitive suite of instruments, SPICA, recently selected as a 
candidate for ESAâ€™s Cosmic Visions program, stands poised to 
revolutionize these fields by providing ultra-deep spectroscopy in the 
12-230 Âµm range, as well as imaging (17-37 Âµm and 100-350 Âµm) and 
polarimetry (100-350 Âµm). With launch planned for 2030, SPICA will 
provide a huge leap in capabilities over previous infrared space 
missions, and complement current and upcoming facilities, filling the 
spectral gap between JWST and ALMA. We would like to invite the 
international astronomical community to participate in the conference, 
*/Exploring the Infrared Universe: The Promise of SPICA/*, which will 
take place on the island of Crete on 20-23 May 2019.At this conference, 
participants will learn about the capabilities and current design of 
SPICA, which includes a significant Guest Observer program, while 
discussing the exciting scientific promise of the mission. Up to 
dateinformation about the SPICA mission and its instruments can be found 
at http://www.spica-mission.org, in addition to links to a set of 
whitepapers recently published in the journal PASA, that focus on some 
of the science enabled by SPICA.

**

*Topics to be addressed:*

-The rise of metals and dust across cosmic time

-Coevolution of galactic star formation and black hole accretion

-Star formation and the baryon cycle in galaxies

-Magnetic fields and turbulence in star formation

-Protoplanetary disks and the formation of habitable planets

-Debris disks, planetary systems, and the Solar system
