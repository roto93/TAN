Arizona Radio Observatory: Call for Proposals (2018A)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Astronomers in Taiwan,

The Arizona Radio Observatory (ARO) solicits observing proposals for the ALMA Prototype 12-meter Telescope (12m) located on Kitt Peak, Arizona, and for the 10-meter Submillimeter Telescope (SMT) located on Mount Graham, Arizona, for the period February 15, 2018 - June 15, 2018. Proposal candidates from members of the University Consortium of ALMA-Taiwan (UCAT) and ASIAA should submit up to THREE pages of scientific and technical justification (including figures, tables, and references) in addition to their Proposal Summary Sheet (download form here):
https://www.as.arizona.edu/sites/default/files/ARO_Proposal_Cover_Sheet.pdf

All proposal candidates are required to list on the Proposal Summary Sheet their requested observing blocks (the exact LST ranges to be scheduled and number of times to be repeated), dates on which they are not available to observe, and dates in which sources in those observing blocks are within the Sun-avoidance zone (45 degrees at the SMT, 10 degrees at the 12m).

The 12m ALMA Prototype antenna currently supports an ALMA Band 3 (82.5-116 GHz) dual-polarization SBS (sideband-separating) receiver.  The 12m control system supports dual-polarization in the same sideband or single-polarization in each sideband ("2 IF mode"), position-switched, beam-switched, and OTF observations.  A new spectrometer, AROWS, is being commissioned on the 12m telescope and is being made available on a best effort basis with 2 channels.  The AROWS center IF frequency is fixed at 6.0 GHz for the full 4 GHz bandwidth mode, but is steerable within the 4 GHz IF bandwidth in the higher resolution/smaller bandwidth modes.  The older MAC autocorrelator and filter banks will still be available as a backup.  Possible backend modes may be found on the ARO Equipment Summary and Status sheet at:
https://www.as.arizona.edu/arizona-radio-observatory

The 10m SMT currently supports a dual-polarization ALMA Band 6 (211-280 GHz) receiver with SBS mixers and a Band 7 (320-370 GHz) DSB receiver. Higher frequency receivers will not be available this semester. The SMT control system supports both dual-polarization ("2 IF mode") and dual-polarization+dual-sideband observations ("4 IF mode") with tunable IF from 4.5-7.5 GHz, for position-switched, beam-switched, and OTF observations.  Proposal candidates should consult the ARO Equipment Summary and Status sheet for additional technical specifications: 
https://www.as.arizona.edu/arizona-radio-observatory

Remote observing is available. Observers who plan to observe remotely must supply fixed IP address(es) of the computer(s) that will be used during observing on their Proposal Summary Sheet. For further information about remote observing and other operational questions, please contact Tom Folkers, Operations Manager:  tfolkers@email.arizona.edu.

Scheduling of successful proposals will be done according to availability of the receivers requested.  Graduate student participation is especially encouraged. 
The proposal deadline for this 2018 spring semester is set on January 31, 2018.

Proposals should be emailed in PDF format to kuan[at]asiaa.sinica.edu.tw by midnight (23:59 CST) January 31, 2018 (Wednesday).

Topic:         Populating H2 and CO in galaxy simulation with dust evolution
Time:         1/22 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:         R1203


*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Olivia Jones (University of Edinburgh)
Topic:         Dust Production from Evolved Stars in the Local Group
Time:         1/23 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
Infrared observations of nearby galaxies and the Milky Way show that there are two main sources of ISM dust: the winds of evolved stars and supernovae ejecta. However, the total dust contribution from evolved stars relative to supernovae, and how it changes with metallicity, is less certain. Infrared photometric and spectroscopic Spitzer Surveys of the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC, SMC): Surveying the Agents of Galaxy Evolution (SAGE) resulted in the discovery of thousands of evolved stars. Here, I will describe how the composition and quantity of dust produced by these stars depends on metallicity. I will also discuss how the mid-IR stellar populations of the Magellanic Clouds can be used as a template for potential observations with JWST, and how we have applied this to our observing programs of Local Group galaxies and SN1987A with JWST.
