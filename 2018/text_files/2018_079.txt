*** Colloquium ***

Speaker:    Vivien Chen (NTHU)
Topic:         Filamentary Accretion Flows in the IRDC M17 SWex
Time:         6/6 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
Although filamentary structures are ubiquitous in molecular clouds, basic observational constraints are needed to clarify the role of filaments in the mass assembly process. Using ALMA Band 3, we have performed full-synthesis imaging of the N2H+ (1-0) emission in the remarkable IRDC complexes, M17 SWex, where a delayed onset of massive star formation was reported in the two hubs at the convergence of multiple filaments of parsec length.  We derive gas kinematics by fitting the hyperfine components of N2H+ spectra.  The mass accretion rates are in the range of 10^-5 to 10^-4 Msun/yr.  The line widths suggest a transonic nature of dense gas in the filaments.  A comparison study of viral parameters from filaments, clumps, to cores is made.  The observation results all together are consistent with the hierarchical gravitational collapse scenario.
