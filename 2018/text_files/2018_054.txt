Dear all,

    I would like to remind you that there is a major issue in the CASA 5.1 releases which seriously affects mosaic imaging of simulated data. 
    If simulated mosaic images obtained with CASA 5.1.* are included in your Cycle 6 proposal, please refer to the following knowledgeable article: 
    https://help.almascience.org/index.php?/Knowledgebase/Article/View/407

    Furthermore, there is a new rule in Cycle 6 --- the figure captions, tables and references included in the proposal Scientific Justification (SJ) must use a 12-point font
      (see Section 5.2.3 in https://almascience.nao.ac.jp/proposing/proposing/proposers-guide)
    If you plan to resubmit your previous cycle proposals, please do remember to change the font size in figure captions, tables and references.
    
best,
Yu-Nung
