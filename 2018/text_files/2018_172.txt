Second circular of SOKENDAI-UST Asia Winter School (SAWS) 2019:
"Star and Planet Formation: Key Questions and Challenges"
___________________________________________________________________

Title: SOKENDAI-UST Asia Winter School (SAWS) 2019
     Star and Planet Formation: Key Questions and Challenges

Web site: https://guas-astronomy.jp/eng/Applicants/winter2018.html

Date: February 27 to March 1, 2019
    - Lecture; 1.5 days
    - Group discussion; 0.5 days in daytime (+ extra nighttime)
    - Presentation; 0.5 days

Venue: Headquarters of the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan,
     Mitaka, Tokyo, Japan (https://www.nao.ac.jp/en/access/mitaka/)

Official language: English

Scientific Rationale: 
The research on star and planet formation has been growing very rapidly 
via ground-based and space-based programs in opt/IR and millimeter/submillimeter 
wavelengths and also via theoretical works. Furthermore, the research will 
be moving to a new era in the next decade with new telescopes, larger opt/IR 
telescopes such as TMT, and space telescopes such as JWST. 
This SAWS2019 provides opportunities to students from EA countries to stay 
at Mitaka in NAOJ and experiences to listen to a series of lectures and discuss 
on key questions, which are still unresolved and really essentials to unveil 
the mystery of star and planet formation. 
NAOJ is a central astronomical observatory in Japan and also a partner 
East Asia Core Observatory (EAO). NAOJ is operating the SUBARU telescope in 
Hawaii, joining international projects such as ALMA and East-Asian VLBI 
Network operation, and TMT construction. NAOJ is also engaged in fostering 
doctoral researchers in astronomy and planetary science as a part of SOKENDAI. 

Candidate Lecturers and topics:
- Observations of forming planets; Jun Hashimoto (ABC/NAOJ)
- Theory of planet formation: Eiichiro Kokubo (NAOJ/SOKENDAI),
  Yasunori Hori (ABC/NAOJ)
- Brown dwarf, IMF/CMF: Motohide Tamura (Univ. Tokyo/ABC/NAOJ)
- First core: Kengo Tomida (Osaka Univ.)
- Low-mass star-formation, outflow/jet: Naomi Hirano (ASIAA)
- Dust and polarization: Akimasa Kataoka (NAOJ/SOKENDAI)
- High-mass star-formation: Kee-Tae Kim (KASI/UST)
- First stars and metal/dust production in the Era of Reionization:
  Akio Inoue (Osaka Sangyo Univ.)
- Astrochemistry and astrobiology: Hideko Nomura (Tokyo Inst. Tech.)
- Future projects: Masao Saito (NAOJ/SOKENDAI), Paul T. P. Ho (EAO)

Format:
- Lecturers will review each topic and give key questions.
  Key scientific papers will be provided to students.
- Students will be divided into small groups to discuss each key
  question based on the papers, under supervision by lecturers
  and additional tutors.
- We would like to ask lecturers to help discussion if they
  are available. We will also ask local staff to help as tutors.
- The results of discussion will be presented in the last session.

Call for applicants:
About 40-50 will be accepted mainly from the MS/PhD students studying
in mainly East Asian region, and travel and hotel expenses are supported
(or offered) for students selected by SOC from SOKENDAI or UST.
