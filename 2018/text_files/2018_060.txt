1. KaVA Call for Proposal
2. EAVN Call for Proposal


-------------------------------------------------
1. KaVA
********************************
Call for Proposals of KaVA (KVN and VERA Array) 2018B
Deadline:  1st June, 2018, 08:00 UT
*********************************

We invite proposals for the open use observations of the KaVA
(http://kava.kasi.re.kr), a joint VLBI array of the KVN (Korean
VLBI Network) and the VERA (VLBI exploration of Radio Astrometry).
The joint array consists of three 21-m KVN telescopes and four
20-m VERA telescopes, with baseline lengths ranging from 300 km
to 2300 km.

This open use call is to provide VLBI observations at 22 GHz and
43 GHz for astronomers around the world. We support astronomers in
the preparation of proposals, scheduling, and data analysis. For
that reason, proposers who are not familiar with KaVA capability
are strongly recommended to consult with KaVA experts prior to
submission. If it is difficult to find collaborators from VERA or
KVN, please contact us to find one. The contact address for the
support is kavaprop (at-mark) kasi.re.kr.

In order to avoid conflicts and/or duplication of the targets
between open use proposals and the existing KaVA Large Programs,
proposers are highly recommended to visit KaVA Large Program (LP)
webpage where KaVA LPs and their source list are presented at
http://radio.kasi.re.kr/kava/large_programs.php.

Even though the proposed targets are listed in the LPs, they will be
accepted as separate open use observations if the scientific goal of
the proposals cannot be achieved with the data of the LPs. Otherwise,
we encourage the proposers to collaborate with the science teams of
the corresponding KaVA LPs. Observations will be conducted with
single polarization (LCP) and 1-Gbps data rate. Please consult the
KaVA status report for the details.

https://radio.kasi.re.kr/kava/status_report18b/node3.html

The total available observation time is up to 250 hours and the
observations will be scheduled between 1st September 2018 and 15th
January 2019. The maximum observing time per proposal is limited to
100 hours. If requested, the observation time can be allocated over
a year, until 15th June 2019, but the observation time will be still
limited to 100 hours. The deadline for submission is at 08:00 UT on
1st June 2018. Detailed information on the proposal submission can
be found at http://radio.kasi.re.kr/kava/proposal_info.php.

* ToO opportunity
It is strongly recommended that Target of Opportunity proposals
(especially expected ToO) are submitted to regular CfP of KaVA.
Unexpected or urgent ToO can be submitted to ask Director's time at
any time. These proposals must include clear triggering criteria to
initiate an observation. The ToO is valid for one year when it is
approved. The ToO proposals to Director's time should follow the same
format of regular call and should be sent to kavaprop (at-mark) kasi.re.kr.

* Recovery Observation
If an open use observation has more than one missing station due to
system trouble and/or very severe weather conditions (e.g. strong wind
due to a typhoon), the PI can request recovery observations within a
year of receiving the correlated data. The PI should resubmit the
proposal which should clarify the necessity of recovery observations.
The KaVA TAC will consider the time allocation of the recovery observations
for the next season. If you have any questions, please send an email
to kavaprop (at-mark)kasi.re.kr

Sincerely,

Jongsoo Kim
Director of Radio Astronomy Division, KASI

2. EAVN
*************************************
Call for Proposals of the East-Asian VLBI Network (EAVN)
in 2018B semester
Submission deadline: 1st June, 2018, 08:00 UT
*************************************

* Overview
We invite proposals for the open-use observations of the East-Asian
VLBI Network (EAVN). In 2018B semester, 9 telescopes participate in
the EAVN open use, 7 telescopes of the KVN and VERA Array (KaVA) in
Korea and Japan, Nobeyama 45-m telescope in Japan, and Tianma 65-m
telescope in China. Refer to the following EAVN website for more
details about overview of the array and its performance, user support
system, and how to prepare and submit a proposal.

http://eavn.kasi.re.kr/

This open-use call is based on risk-share, and provides opportunities
of VLBI observations at 22 and 43 GHz for astronomers in the world.
A VLBI observation with single polarization (LHCP) and the data
recording rate of 1 Gbps (total bandwidth of 256 MHz) is available
in 2018B semester.

The total observation time for EAVN is up to 100 hours and observations
will be scheduled between 1st September 2018 and 15th January 2019,
while the available machine time and possible observation term for
each telescope differ from each other. Refer to the EAVN Status Report,
which can be downloaded via the EAVN webpage, for more details.

* Target of Opportunity proposal
We do not accept ToO proposals with EAVN full array in 2018B semester.

* Proposal Submission
An EAVN application form can be downloaded from the following webpage
(same as KaVA):

http://radio.kasi.re.kr/kava/proposal_kava.php .

Note that the same process will be taken for the EAVN proposal
submission and evaluation.

The maximum request time per proposal is limited to 24 hours for EAVN.
A proposal shall contain the coversheet (two pages), scientific
justification including figures (maximum of two pages), and technical
justification (maximum of one page) with the minimum font size of 10 pt.
Proposal submission deadline is 1st June 2018, 08:00 UT.

* Inquiry
Send an e-mail to eavnprop (at) kasi.re.kr if you have any inquiries
regarding EAVN open use.

Topic:         Letting the Data Speak for Themselves: What Observations Tell Us About Galaxy Formation
Time:         4/25 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
We infer the star formation rates in dark matter halos at different
redshifts from halo merger histories expected in a Lambda CDM cosmology
using Bayesian inference and Bayes ratios to restrict the model complexity,
constrained to match the observed stellar mass/luminosity functions of galaxies
at different redshifts and the local cluster galaxy luminosity function, which
has a steeper faint end than that of field galaxies.  The only other
assumptions that we make are that the star formation rate of central galaxies
depends on the halo mass and redshift and that when a galaxy becomes a satellite
its star formation rate is quenched exponentially and it can eventually merge
with the central galaxy on a dynamical friction timescale.
We find that 1) the star formation in the central galaxies of high mass
halos (>10e12) has to be boosted at high redshift beyond what is expected from
a simple scaling of the dynamical time; 2) below z=2 the star formation in
halos below 1e11 must be quenched, which is not directly expected in standard
stellar feedback models and is most easily explained by some form of preheating,
and implies that there is a significant old stellar population in present-day
dwarf galaxies with M_star < 1e8 and steep slopes for the high redshift
stellar mass and star formation rate functions 3) the stellar mass of galaxies
assembles in one of three ways depending on halo mass: > 1e12 the galaxies
assemble through mergers and should hence have a spheroidal morphology and
between 1e11 and 1e12 (e.g MW) it assembles slowly and at z>2 has less than 5%
of its mass in place, which has extreme observational consequences.
