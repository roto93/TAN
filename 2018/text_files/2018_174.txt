*** Special Seminar ***
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:        Arturo Manchado (Instituto de AstrofÃ­sica de Canarias)
Topic:          Nanostructures in evolved star
Time:           11/8 (Thursday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
The detections of fullerenes and (possibly) planar C24   
(a small fragment of a graphene sheet) in the H-rich circumstellar 
environments of evolved stars show that formation of these complex   
species does not require an H-poor environment contrary to general 
expectation. This together with the very recent identification of
the fullerene cation C 60+ as a diffuse interstellar band (DIB) carrier (the only DIB
carrier known to date) reinforce the idea that these molecular  nanostructures are
ubiquitous in space. The understanding of the formation route of these complex
organic species requires an interdisciplinary research, crossing the boundaries
between astronomers, chemists, and physicists, with potential applications in
nanotechnology and industry. 
Here, I review the main results of the interdisciplinary approach carried out at the
IAC in order to learn about complex molecular nanostructures in   evolved   stars.
In particular the spatial distribution of C60 in the planetary nebula IC 418.
Finally, I underline the main open questions and future directions like the expected
observations on these complex organics in evolved stars from future facilities such
as the James Webb Space Telescope.
