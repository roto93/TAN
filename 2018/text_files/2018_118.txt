Topic:        Extended dust emission from nearby Asymptotic Giant Branch stars
Time:        8/6 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:          R1203
Abstract:
Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars in the Milky Way are often overlooked due to difficulties in obtaining distances. Understanding their dust emission properties and mass-loss histories leads to better comprehension of the ISM evolution in the Milky Way, in particular its dust reservoir. Most studies have determined the stellar dust mass using mid-IR emission, but a historic cold dust reservoir from a previous mass-loss phase may remain undetected in the mid-IR, requiring observations at longer wavelengths.

We present results of a search for extended dust emission from a diverse sample of AGB stars within 1 kpc. This project is part of the Nearby Evolved Star Survey (NESS), which aims to determine gas and dust return from a volume limited sample of galactic evolved stars.

Observations at 450?μm? and 850?μm? were carried out using the SCUBA-2 instrument on the JCMT and combined with Herschel PACS observations at 70?μm? and 160?μm from the MESS survey (Groenewegen et al., 2011; Cox et al., 2012). Using azimuthally-averaged surface brightness profiles we determined extension and percentage flux of the extended component for each source at the four wavelengths. We derived extensions at the 3σ levels greater than ~40'' for majority of the sources at SCUBA-2 850?μm?. The fraction of the flux emitted from the extended region is ~40% at 850?μm? and ~50% at PACS wavelengths.

We report a clear detection of the detached shell of U Ant in both 450?μm? and 850?μm?. This is the first time this detached shell has been detected in the sub-mm continuum.

By fitting a modified black body to four-point SEDs at each radial point we derive the dust temperature, spectral index of emissivity, and column density to probe dust mass-loss history and detect changes in physical properties of dust as a function radius (hence, time). The resulting dust-to-gas ratios are consistent with canonicalvalues. The surface density profiles suggest deviation from constant mass loss in a majority of the sources.

Arizona Radio Observatory: Call for Proposals (2018B)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Astrophysicists and Astronomers of Taiwan,

The Arizona Radio Observatory (ARO) solicits observing proposals for the ALMA Prototype 12-meter Telescope (12m) located on Kitt Peak, Arizona, and for the 10-meter Submillimeter Telescope (SMT) located on Mount Graham, Arizona, for the period October 15, 2018 - February 15, 2019. Proposal candidates from members of the University Consortium of ALMA-Taiwan (UCAT) and ASIAA should submit up to THREE pages of scientific and technical justification (including figures, tables, and references) in addition to their Proposal Summary Sheet (download form here):
https://www.as.arizona.edu/sites/default/files/ARO_Proposal_Cover_Sheet.pdf

All proposal candidates are required to list on the Proposal Summary Sheet their requested observing blocks (the exact LST ranges to be scheduled and number of times to be repeated), dates on which they are NOT available to observe, and dates in which sources in those observing blocks are within the Sun-avoidance zone (45 degrees at the SMT, 10 degrees at the 12m).

The 12m ALMA Prototype antenna currently supports an ALMA Band 3 (82.5-116 GHz) dual-polarization SBS (sideband-separating) receiver.  The 12m control system supports dual-polarization in the same sideband or single-polarization in each sideband ("2 IF mode"), position-switched, beam-switched, and OTF observations.  The new AROWS spectrometer is the recommended backend for 12m observations.  The MAC and Filterbanks are still available; however, the Filterbanks will be decommissioned at the end of the 2018B semester.

The 10m SMT currently supports a dual-polarization ALMA Band 6 (211-280 GHz) receiver with SBS mixers.  Higher frequency receivers will not be available this semester.  The SMT control system supports both dual-polarization ("2 IF mode") and dual-polarization+dual-sideband observations ("4 IF mode") with tunable IF from 4.5-7.5 GHz, for position-switched, beam-switched, and OTF observations. 

Proposal candidates should consult the ARO Equipment Summary and Status sheet at https://www.as.arizona.edu/arizona-radio-observatory for possible backend modes and additional technical specifications.  Remote observing is available. Observers who plan to observe remotely must supply fixed IP address(es) of the computer(s) that will be used during observing on their Proposal Summary Sheet. For further information about remote observing and other operational questions, please contact Tom Folkers, ARO Software Engineer:  tfolkers@email.arizona.edu .

Scheduling of successful proposals will be done according to availability of the receivers requested.  Graduate student participation is especially encouraged. Proposals should be emailed in PDF format to kuan[at]asiaa.sinica.edu.tw by midnight (23:59 CST) September 10, 2018 (Monday).
