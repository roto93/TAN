Topic:         INFLUENCE OF VELOCITY DISPERSIONS ON STAR FORMATION ACTIVITIES IN GALAXIES
Time:         7/9 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
We investigate the influence of the random velocity of molecular gas on the star forming activities in molecular clouds. It is known that physical states of a molecular cloud, such as temperature and density, will influence the star forming activities in the cloud. Besides, it is believed that local and turbulent motions of the molecules in the cloud might provide a significant amount of pressure against gravitational collapse and might thus prevent or reduce star formation in the cloud. However, the influence of the gas motions on the star formation activities is still poorly understood. We used the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) data to obtain 12CO(J=1-0) flux and velocity dispersion, combining with the 3.6 and 8 micron mid-infrared data of the Spitzer Space Telescope to probe the effects of gas motion on star formation activities for several nearby galaxies. From our results we were able to derive a modified Kennicutt-Schmidt law with velocity dispers!
ion as an additional parameter. We found that the higher the velocity dispersion in molecular clouds, the lower the star formation activities.

Topic:         A journey to the Earth and icy bodies’ interiors
Time:         7/11 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
Physical properties of constituent materials in the Earth and planetary interiors are key to determine their formation history and thermo-chemical structures, etc. In particular, knowledge of the thermal conductivity of these constituent materials under relevant pressure-temperature conditions plays critical roles in understanding many geophysical phenomena within the Earth and planetary bodies, such as the temperature profile and dynamics of the mantle and core, as well as the heat flux across the core-mantle boundary. Recently we have successfully combined ultrafast optics with high pressure diamond cells to precisely measure lattice thermal conductivity of Earth’s mantle and core materials and water-volatile mixtures under extreme conditions. Modeling of our new data show significant influences of hydration, iron, aluminum, and volatiles on the thermal states and dynamics of the Earth and icy bodies. I will also discuss some future directions that are important to furth!
er understand the thermal history of the Earth and icy bodies.

Topic:         Optically-faint radio galaxies found by Subaru Hyper-Suprime Cam and VLA FIRST
Time:         7/12 (Thursday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
I will present optical and radio properties of optically-faint radio galaxies (RGs) found by an on-going project, a Wide and Deep Exploration of Radio Galaxies with Subaru HSC (WERGS). RGs possess powerful radio-jets, which could give a so-called feedback effect on host galaxies. As the host galaxies are thought to be typically massive, RGs are important for understanding the evolution of massive galaxies. We carried out a cross-match between the VLA FIRST radio catalog and the deep (i_AB < 27) and wide imaging catalog by Hyper-Suprime Cam Subaru Strategic Program. We successfully identified ~3600 radio-AGNs in the 156 deg^2 field (Yamashita et al. 2018). The number of the matches is equivalent to ~50% of FIRST sources, which is higher than that of SDSS counterparts (~30%). Optically-faint RGs (i_AB > 21) in the sample are mostly located at photometric redshifts z > 1 and show higher radio-loudness (log R > 4) than the SDSS RGs. The results might infer that these optically-f!
aint RGs have low accretion rate or obscured nuclei. Some of the optically-faint RGs have blue optical colors which are not consistent with that of passive galaxies but can be explained by predominant young stellar populations. Our optically-faint RG sample might include “evolving” RGs that are star-forming. I will also discuss the redshift evolution of such blue RGs.
