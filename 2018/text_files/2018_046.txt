Topic:         The Quenching of Star Formation in Galaxy Clusters since z~1
Time:         4/9 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
I will present an analysis of the quenching of star formation (SF) in galaxy clusters since z~1, based on a sample of 220 galaxy clusters from the SpARCS survey in the XMM-LSS and ELAIS-N1 fields, using the public data release from HSC-SSP and Sptizer SWIRE survey data in these fields. In particular, we examine the star-forming
galaxy fraction (f_SF) as a function of redshift, galaxy stellar mass, and cluster-centric radius. I will also present some preliminary results on the SFR-stellar mass relation (the "main sequence") in the field and in clusters, using a combination of HSC and Spitzer SWIRE MIPS data, over the same redshift range.

Topic:         Formation of Regular Moons in Weakly Accreting Circumplanetary Dis=
ks
Time:         4/11 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203

Abstract:
During the formation phase of gas giants, circumplanetary gaseous disk form=
around the planets. Circumplanetary disks are important not only for mass =
supply to gas giants but also for formation of regular satellites. Because =
of the comparatively small size-scale of the sub-disk, quick magnetic diffu=
sion prevents the magnetorotational instability (MRI) from being well-devel=
oped at ionization levels that would allow MRI in the parent protoplanetary=
disk. In the absence of significant angular momentum transport, continuous=
mass supply from the parental protoplanetary disk leads to the formation o=
f a massive circumplanetary disk. We have developed an evolutionary model f=
or this scenario and have estimated the orbital evolution of satellites wit=
hin the disk. In a certain temperature range, we find that inward migration=
of a satellite can be stopped by a disk structure due to the opacity trans=
itions. We also find that the second and third migrating satellites can be =
captured in mean motion resonances. In this way, a compact system in Laplac=
e resonance, which are similar to inner three bodies of Galilean satellites=
, can be formed in our disk models.
