Speaker:    Jia-Wei Wang (NTHU)
Topic:         Multi-wavelength polarization observation toward the filamentary cloud IC5146
Time:         3/19 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
Whether magnetic fields are important in the star formation is a fundamental question in astrophysics. The studies in past decades show that the role of magnetic fields in star formation is complicated and diverse, and that neither of the two extreme case theories (dominating or negligible magnetic fields) can fully explain the star formation activity. Hence, the detailed investigations of the role of magnetic fields in particular physical scale, density, and environments are necessary to reveal the full picture, which thus requires multi-wavelength observations to trace. In this talk, I would present our polarization observations in optical, infrared, and submillimeter wavelengths toward the filamentary clouds IC5146. I would first discuss how deep we can trace using each data set, and further show how the role of magnetic fields possibly change in different scale.
