*/Exploring the Infrared Universe: The Promise of SPICA/*

Crete, Greece

20-23 May 2019

http://www.spica2019.org/

*Deadline for abstracts: 2018 December 1*

*
*

We now invite the community to submit abstracts for contributed talks 
and posters for the conference "Exploring the Infrared Universe: The 
Promise of SPICA". We welcome contributions with clear connections to 
SPICA, and are very interested in contributions that can help to 
finalize the design of SPICA,and to strengthen or augment the SPICA 
science case.

**

*Science rationale:*

The infrared wavelength range is key to understand the origin and 
evolutionof galaxies, stars and planetary systems, which are obscured by 
dust during a large part of their life cycles. With a large cold mirror 
and a sensitive suite of instruments, SPICA, recently selected as a 
candidate for ESAâ€™s Cosmic Visions program, stands poised to 
revolutionize these fields by providing ultra-deep spectroscopy in the 
12-230 Âµm range, as well as imaging (17-37 Âµm and 100-350 Âµm) and 
polarimetry (100-350 Âµm). With launch planned for 2030, SPICA will 
provide a huge leap in capabilities over previous infrared space 
missions, and complement current and upcoming facilities, filling the 
spectral gap between JWST and ALMA. We would like to invite the 
international astronomical community to participate in the conference, 
*/Exploring the Infrared Universe: The Promise of SPICA/*, which will 
take place on the island of Crete on 20-23 May 2019.At this conference, 
participants will learn about the capabilities and current design of 
SPICA, which includes a significant Guest Observer program, while 
discussing the exciting scientific promise of the mission. Up to 
dateinformation about the SPICA mission and its instruments can be found 
at http://www.spica-mission.org, in addition to links to a set of 
whitepapers recently published in the journal PASA, that focus on some 
of the science enabled by SPICA.
