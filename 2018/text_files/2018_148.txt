______________________________________

Call for Proposals 2019A (KVN VLBI)
______________________________________

The Korean VLBI Network (KVN, http://kvn.kasi.re.kr) invites scientific
proposals for VLBI observations during the 2019A season from astronomers
around the world. Observations of successful proposals will be scheduled
between 15th January 2019 and 15th June 2019. Proposals should be emailed
to kvnprop@kasi.re.kr before the deadline of UT 08:00 (KST 17:00) on 1st
November 2018.

The Korean VLBI Network (KVN) is a dedicated mm-VLBI network, operated by
the Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute (KASI, http://www.kasi.re.kr).
Its three 21m radio telescopes are located around South Korea in Seoul,
Ulsan, and Jeju Island. The baseline length ranges from 305km to 476 km.
Its 4-channel receiving system allows simultaneous observation at 22, 43,
86, and 129 GHz. Higher than 1 Gbps recording rates (2, 4 and 8 Gbps) using
Mark6 recorder are available. Total time of 300 hours are planned for this
call. The maximum observation time of a proposal is limited to 100 hours.
If requested in proposals, the observation time can be allocated over a
year, until January 15, 2020, but the observation time will not be
increased. Details of the information and current status of the KVN can be
found in the KVN VLBI Status Report (
https://radio.kasi.re.kr/kvn/status_report_2019/array.html).

Proposers should use the KVN VLBI observing application form (the .tex file
can be found athttp://kvn.kasi.re.kr/index.html/obs_proposal.php). Please
carefully follow the instructions of the proposal form. A separate
scientific and technical justification is mandatory. This Justification
should be submitted together with the proposal form and not exceed 3 pages.
