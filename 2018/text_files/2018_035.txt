Dear All

third announcement of the workshop on formation of substellar objects in 
Madrid in May. The deadline for abstracts is next Thursday.

If you are interested in the field, this is a good chance to discuss 
what has been done until now and where we will go next.

Formation of substellar objects: theory and observations

ESAC May 21-23, 2018

Madrid, Spain

Deadline for abstract submission and early registration fee is ONLY 15 
DAYS AWAY

**********************************************************************************



On behalf of Local and Scientific Organizing Committees, we are pleased 
to announce a three days workshop devoted to brown dwarfs and their 
formation mechanism/s. More than 20 years have passed since the 
discovery of the first confirmed substellar objects. However, there are 
still many problems concerning brown dwarf formation and evolution.

During the last years, a large number of works have been focused on 
explaining the origin of brown dwarfs. Thanks to Spitzer, Herschel and 
lately ALMA, there are now evidences of a star-like scenario to explain 
the formation of these substellar objects. However, there are still open 
questions, like the role of turbulence, and the efficiency of other 
mechanisms (e.g. photo-evaporation, disk fragmentation) to produce BDs. 
On the other hand, the study of young clusters is producing more and 
more spectroscopically confirmed substellar IMFs, which are fundamental 
to understand BD formation and evolution.

The scope of this workshop is to gather experts on BD formation, both 
theoreticians and observational astronomers, to discuss about the 
results of the last decade. We plan to compare the theoretical 
expectations with the results from observations to understand which 
questions have been answered, and which ones are still open. Moreover, 
experts from other fields, such as exoplanets and chemical modeling, are 
welcome since one of the goals is to study the phenomena from a 
comprehensive perspective and to produce new synergies and projects.  In 
addition, we will discuss about the advances that can be done in this 
field with the advent of new facilities like e.g. JWST or Euclid.
