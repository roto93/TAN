Dear colleague,

Here is the announcement of the workshop "Dynamics and physics of outflows 
in protostellar disks and active galactic nucleiâ€  that will be held on Jan. 13 & 14,
2019 in Kagoshima University.
The deadline for registration & abstract submission is Nov. 30.

Placeï¼šã€€Kagoshima University
Invited speakersï¼š   
   Prof. S. Aalto (Onsala Space Observatory, Sweden), 
   Prof.  M. Machida (Kyushu University)
   Dr. T. Izumi (National Astronomical Observatory of Japan)
   Dr. S. Takasao (Nagoya University )   


contributed talksï¼šã€€10-20 talks
languageï¼šã€€English

SOC:   K. Wada (Kagoshima), T. Izumi (NAOJ), M. Machida
LOC:   K. Wada

Purpose:  This workshop will be held a part of the kick-off symposium for the Amanoga Galaxy Astronomy Research Center, which will start on 1 January 2019
as a new research institute of Kagoshima University.   This workshop aims to exchange recent observational and theoretical progress in
a field of molecular outflows in protostars and AGNs. Since both phenomena have some physical and observational similarities, it is worth discussing recent findings by ALMA and theoretical studies
in both fields. We hope that this workshop is a beginning of
a future collaboration between the two phenomena on very different scales.
