Topic:         The Seasonal Evolution of the Atmospheres of Pluto and Other Dwarf Planets
Time:         8/20 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
Dwarf planets in Kuiper belt are too far for us to study in detail by telescopic observations from Earth for past several decades. After the New Horizons spacecraft’s flyby observations of the Pluto-Charon system in July 2015, we now have a better understanding of these faraway objects. Sputnik Planitia of Pluto is one of the most important discoveries of the New Horizons spacecraft at its flyby observations of the Pluto-Charon system in July 2015. Sputnik Planitia is located at the northern mid-latitude hemisphere in the antipodal position to Charon on the opposite side. It contains a large quantity of the nitrogen ice on Pluto and the content of Pluto’s atmosphere is likely controlled by the variable sublimation rate of Sputnik Planitia’s ice. In this work, we use a coupled treatment to compute the surface temperature and pressure of Sputnik Planitia on Pluto when it revolves around the sun in its eccentric orbit with special attention to the sublimation process of t!
he nitrogen ice stored in Sputnik Planitia. In addition, we will apply this model to other Pluto-like dwarf planets in Kuiper belt which surfaces could be mainly composed of nitrogen ice. This set of model calculations allows us to explore the range of the atmospheric contents and mass loss process of the icy dwarf planets.

Topic:         An X-ray View of Accreting Black Holes
Time:         8/22 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
X-ray emission from accreting black hole systems provide information on the accretion geometry of the innermost region around the black hole. Observational evidence indicates that most black hole systems are consisted of an accretion disk around a central black hole with a hot illuminating corona above the disk plane. The reflection of the X-rays emitted from a corona of energetic particles surrounding an accreting black hole from the accretion disk can be used as a probe of physical processes around the central engine. The most prominent feature of the reflection spectrum, Fe K-alpha fluorescent line, can be broadened by a series of special and general relativistic effects. Measuring the broadness of the line gives an idea of the inner radius of the accretion disk and hence the black hole spin. This talk mainly focuses on modelling the X-ray spectra of low-mass X-ray binaries (LXMBs) and active galactic nuclei (AGN), including systems with complex outflows, using a self-con!
sistent relativistic reflection model.
