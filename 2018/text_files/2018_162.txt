Final Announcement
+++++++++++++++++++

We would like to announce that the 8th east Asian numerical astrophysics meeting (EANAM8) will be held at Cheng-Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan,
from Oct. 22 to Oct. 26, 2018. Our web page: http://eanam8.gsroc.tw .

----------------
Aims and Scope:
----------------
Numerical simulations have become even more important as detailed comparisons
between theories and observations are now possible at a deeper level in most
fields of astrophysics. The aim of this series of meetings is to bring (but
not limited to) East-Asian numerical astrophysicists together and provide
chances to learn each other's work and explore possible collaborations among
them. The scope of the meeting will encompass all major astronomical research
fields that involve numerical simulations, including (but not limited to)
cosmology, astronomical hydrodynamics, magnetohydrodynamics, radiative
transfer, particle acceleration, and planetary / stellar / galactic dynamics.
In addition, there will also be a focus on computer science applications
directed toward astrophysics including numerical methods, simulation data
analysis, high performance computing, and optimization for use on large scale
computer clusters. Participants from outside of East Asia are warmly
welcome as well.

---------------------
Important deadlines:
---------------------
The registration deadline is September 30th, 2018.
The abstract submission deadline is September 22nd, 2018.

>=20
> Over the course of the last several months an issue in CASA mosaic =
imaging was recognized.  The Observatory elected to understand and =
characterize the issue before informing the user community of potential =
impacts on the resulting images.  The CASA team has now identified a =
couple of issues using both the 7-m and 12-m arrays over the course of =
the past few cycles and CASA releases.  The full extent of the data =
affected is still being investigated.
>=20
> The two issues identified by the team with mosaic imaging are:
>=20
> 1.     Mosaicking observations with the 7-m array in Cycles 1-4 (range =
of CASA versions) were all affected.  The Observatory will reimage the =
maps in the archive for those projects and we will inform users of the =
timeline of that campaign.  The impact of this error is the fluxes are =
overestimated by ~10% throughout the map.  This specific issue was =
resolved in Cycle 5 (CASA version 5.1.1) and beyond.
>=20
> 2.     A different and more complex issue arose in the Cycle 5 =
software (CASA version 5.1.1 to 5.3, all versions), which affects all =
mosaics in Cycle 5.  While there are a variety of factors that =
contribute to the range of impacts, the most important parameter is the =
aspect ratio of the mosaic pointing distribution, i.e., the width/length =
ratio of the pointing centers (not the image size).  For projects with =
aspect ratios <1.5, the impact on fluxes throughout the bulk of the map =
is small, with large deviations in flux (>5%) largely confined to the =
edges of the map where the mosaic .pb file reaches values of <0.5.  If =
your science does not depend sensitively on fluxes measured at the edges =
of the mosaic and your aspect ratio is <1.5 the impact is negligible.  =
If your aspect ratio is >=3D1.5, fluxes in the bulk of the map can be =
affected.  This issue has been resolved in the Cycle 6 Pipeline (CASA =
version 5.4.0 or beyond).  The Observatory will determine the aspect =
ratios over the coming weeks and contact PIs regarding corrective action =
timelines.
>=20
>=20
> The Observatory regrets any inconvenience experienced by our ALMA =
users due to these issues. It is recommended that mosaic images are =
regenerated using the latest CASA release, CASA 5.4 (available at =
https://casa.nrao.edu/).  In addition, the Observatory will contact PIs =
further when aspect ratios are determined and follow up actions (e.g. =
QA3) are ready.  The actions that the Observatory is undertaking =
include:
>=20
> 1)    While we determine aspect ratios, all MOUSs with mosaic =
observations will have their proprietary periods paused.
>=20
> 2)    Once aspect ratios are determined, all project MOUSs still in =
proprietary period subject to issue 1, generically, or issue 2, for =
aspect ratios greater or equal to 1.5, will have their proprietary time =
paused retroactively to July 2018.  Projects subject to issue 2 with =
smaller aspect ratios will have proprietary period paused while it is =
determined if the PI needs to recover fluxes in the outer regions of the =
map with high accuracy.  The proprietary time will be extended by the =
amount from July 2018 until the new data products are available to the =
PI.
>=20
> If you have any questions about this issue and the steps taken by the =
Observatory, please contact your local ARC for Support through the ALMA =
Helpdesk at https://help.almascience.org.
