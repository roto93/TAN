Dear colleagues,


     This message is to bring your attention to the conference titled 
"Linking the Milky Way and Nearby Galaxies:  The ISM and Star Formation 
from Cold Cores to kpc Scales" set to take place from 3-7 June 2019 in 
Helsinki,  Finland: 
https://www.helsinki.fi/en/conferences/linking-the-milky-way-and-nearby-galaxies


     The abstract submission deadline is 20 January 2019.  Please note 
that due to venue capacity, the conference is limited to 100 
participants.  Final selection will be based upon scientific 
contribution and on a "first come first served" basis for the 
registration. Abstract submission and pre-registration may be completed 
now.  Depending on final word from sponsors, the conference fee is 
expected to be between 200-300 euro.


Scientific Rationale:

       ISM and star-formation studies of the Milky Way and of nearby 
galaxies are being performed on progressively overlapping physical 
scales. This is a result of the increasing resolution of both 
simulations and observations. The gap between Galactic and extragalactic 
studies is bridged by facilities such as ALMA, GAIA, JVLA, MUSE, and the 
upcoming JWST.  Galaxy simulations begin to break-down when 
sub-cloud-scale physics are not included and, conversely, studies of the 
Milky Way star-formation often ignore the larger, galactic context. 
Thus, now is the time to facilitate discussion between the Galactic and 
nearby galaxy communities among theorists and observers alike.


     We would very much appreciate it if you could forward this 
information to those who may be interested!


On behalf of the LOC, best wishes!
