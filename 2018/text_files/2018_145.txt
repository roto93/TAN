Dear Colleagues,

A celebration of Ron Taam's 70th Birthday and Retirement will be held on
Oct 26 in ASIAA. You are cordially invited to participate and celebrate
together!

https://events.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/meeting/20181026/

If you have prior science collaborations with Ron, you are invited to
contribute a science talk; if you have prior interactions and work
experiences with Ron, you are invited to contribute a work/project talk; or
if you simply like to share your respect or appreciation for Ron or to
share some fun memories, you are invited to contribute a talk of
appreciation.

Please mark your calendar and register to participate!

Depending on the total participation, we will adjust the lengths of the
presentations and some may be arranged for free-format speeches at the
banquet.

Cheers,

Sienny
On behalf of the organizing committee
