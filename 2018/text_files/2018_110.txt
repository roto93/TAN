> To: undisclosed-recipients:;

Dear colleagues,

After the overwhelming response for proposed contributed talks for the =
EVN Symposium 2018 that we had (with 127 abstracts submitted plus 30 =
posters), we expect to have a very stimulating meeting with over 200 =
people attending the Symposium.

An UPDATED PROGRAM of the Symposium, now including the titles of the =
talks (and soon the links to the abstracts), can be found here =
<http://evnsymp2018.iaa.es/content/preliminary-program>.

Please, note that the DEADLINE for REGISTRATION at REDUCED FEE is the =
next 3rd of August, 2018. Registration may be formalized though this web =
form <http://evnsymp2018.iaa.es/content/registration>.

We highly recommend to BOOK YOUR ACCOMMODATION at your earliest =
convenience following our recommendations here =
<http://evnsymp2018.iaa.es/content/accommodation>. Besides the fact that =
Granada is a very touristic destination, during the dates of the EVN =
Symposium there will be a much larger medical conference in the city =
expecting ~2000 attendees. This may make difficult to find accommodation =
in the last minute.

The deadline for APPLICATION for FUNDING SUPPORT by RadioNet has also =
been set on the 3rd of August, 2018. Application for funding support can =
be made during the registration process.

Please, find bellow an updated reproduction of the 3rd Announcement of =
the Symposium.

With best regards,

The next RELEVANT DATES regarding the Symposium are:

    - Deadline for reduced registration fee: 3rd of August, 2018
    - Deadline for application for partial funding support by =
RadioNet: 3rd of August, 2018
=09
A CASA-VLBI tutorial <http://www.jive.eu/casa-tutorial-2018> has been =
organized by JIVE for the late afternoon of October 11th, 2018 (15:30h =
to 16:30h). Separate registration is required through this form =
<https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScQTAavoN0ZBDaEkh3BTyUNqdmCu1r8w=
2XNx19HD6N7oOR_bA/viewform>.

The REDUCED CONFERENCE FEE (290=E2=82=AC) includes admission to all =
scientific sessions and conference materials, welcome reception, coffee =
breaks and lunches during the meeting (Monday to Thursday), and =
conference dinner.=20

If needed, FUNDING SUPPORT from RadioNet can be requested through the =
registration form to get part of the traveling and/or accommodation =
expenses reimbursed. The SOC will decide about the distribution of the =
funding among the applicants proposing a contribution. Application by =
early-stage researchers is encouraged.

The weather and the city environment in Granada is typically excellent =
for the period selected for the conference. A number of social =
activities have been organized, including (among others) a welcome =
reception at Nazari Palace =E2=80=9CCuarto Real de Santo Domingo=E2=80=9D =
(October 7th, evening), the traditional EVN-Symposium football match =
(October 8th, evening), a visit to the historic Alhambra Palaces and =
Gardens (October 9th, evening), a visit to the IRAM 30m millimeter =
Radiotelescope (October 10th, afternoon; if weather allows), and the =
conference dinner in the historic rooms of Santa Paula Palace (October =
10th, evening).

Speaker:    Kate Pattle (NTHU)
Topic:        First measurements of the magnetic field strength in the Pillars of Creation
Time:        7/23 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:          R1203
Abstract:
In this talk I will present the first high-resolution, submillimetre-wavelength, polarimetric observations of - and thus direct observations of the magnetic field morphology within - the dense gas of the Pillars of Creation in M16. These recent results from the JCMT BISTRO (B-fields in Star-forming Region Observations) survey show that the magnetic field runs along the length of these photo-ionized columns, perpendicular to, and decoupled from, the field in the surrounding photoionized cloud.  I will discuss estimation of the magnetic field strength in the columns, and its implications for the formation of the Pillars. I will further discuss the energy balance in the Pillars, and hypothesize on the effect of the magnetic field on the future evolution and lifetime of the Pillars.



*** Colloquium ***

Speaker:    Yongzhong Qian (University of Minnesota)
Topic:        Our Solar System: What Triggered Its Formation?
Time:        7/25 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:          R1203
Abstract:
About 4.6 billion years ago, some event disturbed a cloud of gas and dust, triggering the gravitational collapse that led to the formation of the solar system. One hypothesis is that a nearby supernova - a star exploding at the end of its life cycle - initiated this event. My collaborators and I have examined why earlier forensic evidence based on studies of extinct radioactive nuclei in meteorites have been inconclusive, and shown how recent results from modeling supernovae and their impact on star formation have opened up new directions in researching the formation of our solar system.
