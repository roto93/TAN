Arizona Radio Observatory: Call for Proposals (2018A)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Astronomers in Taiwan,

The Arizona Radio Observatory (ARO) solicits observing proposals for the ALMA Prototype 12-meter Telescope (12m) located on Kitt Peak, Arizona, and for the 10-meter Submillimeter Telescope (SMT) located on Mount Graham, Arizona, for the period February 15, 2018 - June 15, 2018. Proposal candidates from members of the University Consortium of ALMA-Taiwan (UCAT) and ASIAA should submit up to THREE pages of scientific and technical justification (including figures, tables, and references) in addition to their Proposal Summary Sheet (download form here):
https://www.as.arizona.edu/sites/default/files/ARO_Proposal_Cover_Sheet.pdf

All proposal candidates are required to list on the Proposal Summary Sheet their requested observing blocks (the exact LST ranges to be scheduled and number of times to be repeated), dates on which they are not available to observe, and dates in which sources in those observing blocks are within the Sun-avoidance zone (45 degrees at the SMT, 10 degrees at the 12m).

The 12m ALMA Prototype antenna currently supports an ALMA Band 3 (82.5-116 GHz) dual-polarization SBS (sideband-separating) receiver.  The 12m control system supports dual-polarization in the same sideband or single-polarization in each sideband ("2 IF mode"), position-switched, beam-switched, and OTF observations.  A new spectrometer, AROWS, is being commissioned on the 12m telescope and is being made available on a best effort basis with 2 channels.  The AROWS center IF frequency is fixed at 6.0 GHz for the full 4 GHz bandwidth mode, but is steerable within the 4 GHz IF bandwidth in the higher resolution/smaller bandwidth modes.  The older MAC autocorrelator and filter banks will still be available as a backup.  Possible backend modes may be found on the ARO Equipment Summary and Status sheet at:
https://www.as.arizona.edu/arizona-radio-observatory

The 10m SMT currently supports a dual-polarization ALMA Band 6 (211-280 GHz) receiver with SBS mixers and a Band 7 (320-370 GHz) DSB receiver.  A 0.4 mm (602-720 GHz) dual-polarization receiver with ALMA Band 9 mixers will be available on a best effort basis for the period of Dec-Feb; proposers for the 0.4 mm receiver are strongly encouraged to also submit a 1 mm proposal (low frequency backup project) at the same LST range.  Higher frequency receivers will not be available this
semester. The SMT control system supports both dual-polarization ("2 IF mode") and dual-polarization+dual-sideband observations ("4 IF mode") with tunable IF from 4.5-7.5 GHz, for position-switched, beam-switched, and OTF observations.  Proposal candidates should consult the ARO Equipment Summary and Status sheet for additional technical specifications: 
https://www.as.arizona.edu/arizona-radio-observatory

Remote observing is available. Observers who plan to observe remotely must supply fixed IP address(es) of the computer(s) that will be used during observing on their Proposal Summary Sheet. For further information about remote observing and other operational questions, please contact Tom Folkers, Operations Manager:  tfolkers@email.arizona.edu.

Scheduling of successful proposals will be done according to availability of the receivers requested.  Graduate student participation is especially encouraged. The proposal deadline for this 2017 fall semester is set on September 15, 2017 (Friday).

Proposals should be emailed in PDF format to kuan[at]asiaa.sinica.edu.tw by midnight (23:59 CST) January 31, 2018 (Wednesday).

Topic:         New Taiwan-Russia Collaboration on Cosmic Dust
Time:         1/15 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:         R1203

Speaker:    Andreas Schulze (NAOJ)
Topic:         New constraints on the black hole spin in radio-loud quasars
Time:         1/17 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
One of the major unsolved questions on the understanding of the AGN population is the origin of the dichotomy between radio-quiet and radio-loud quasars. The most promising explanation is provided by the spin paradigm, which suggests radio-loud quasars to have higher black hole spin. However, the measurement of black hole spin remains extremely challenging.
We here present results comparing the mean radiative efficiencies of carefully matched samples of radio-loud and radio-quiet SDSS quasars at 0.3<z<0.8. We find evidence for systematically larger radiative efficiencies by a factor > 1.5 in the radio-loud sample, suggesting that the radio-loud quasar population has on average higher black hole spin that the radio-quiet population. This provides observational support for the black hole spin paradigm.



*** Special Seminar ***

Speaker:    Haifeng Yang (University of Virginia)
Topic:         Origins of (sub)millimeter disk polarization
Time:         1/18 (Thursday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
Polarized (sub)millimeter emission from dust grains has long been established as a reliable way to probe magnetic fields in molecular clouds, based on the magnetic alignment of dust grains. At the same time, from theoretical studies, magnetic field is very important in the star formation and the evolution of protoplanetary disks, through either magnetorotational instability or magnetic-driven winds. The application of this method to the first resolved polarization observation in the protoplanetary disk HL Tau, however, yields rather unphysical magnetic field configuration and thus fails badly. This leaves an outstanding question: what are the origins of (sub)millimeter disk polarization? I will discuss the favored alternative mechanism, the “self-scattering” of dust grains, which successfully explains a lot of ALMA polarization observations to date. This brings both good news and bad news to the community. On the dark side, it’s harder to probe magnetic field with (sub!
)millimeter disk polarization, although we still found suggestive evidence in the IRAS 4A1 disk at long wavelength. On the bright side, polarization coming from “self-scattering” strongly depends on the properties of dust grains, including grain sizes, the optical depth, and thickness of dust disks. These allow us to study many important things, such as grain growth and dust settling.

Dear all,

We will have TTTT seminar on 16 Jan. in NTHU
given by Dr. Yu-Yen Chang.

Title:
SMG Structural Properties and NIR Morphologies

Speaker: Dr. Yu-Yen Chang
Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Academia Sinica

Time: 12:20pm 16th Jan. 2018 (Tuesday)

Venue: R501, IoA, 5th floor in the 2nd General Building

Abstract:
I will present the structural parameters and morphological properties
of faint 450 um selected submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) in the
COSMOS-CANDELS region. We investigate stellar structures of 174
faint 450 um sources at z<3 using HST near-infrared observations.
Based on our spectral energy distribution fitting, about half of such faint
SMGs lie above the main sequence, and half of them are on the main
sequence. The size-mass relation shows that these SMGs are generally
similar to star-forming galaxies. In general, 850 um sources are more
extended than 450 um sources, and 450 um sources are more extended
than normal galaxies. For the stellar mass and SFR matched sample, the
size differences are marginal between faint SMGs and the comparison
galaxies. However, faint SMGs have similar Sersic index and projected axis
ratio as star-forming galaxies with the same stellar mass and SFR at z~2.
Most SMGs (~80%) show disturbed features, but the fractions depend on
the SFR for both the SMGs and the comparison samples. Our results suggest
that galaxy merging is related to star formation activities, and the 
stellar
structures of SMGs are similar to those of star-forming galaxies.

With best regards,
Tetsuya
