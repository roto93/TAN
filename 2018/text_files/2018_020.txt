*** Special Seminar ***
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Yasuhiro Hasegawa (JPL)
Topic:         Planet Formation in Star-Forming Regions: from the Solar System to Other Worlds
Time:         2/12 (Monday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
Planet formation is one of the fundamental ingredients in (exo)planetary sciences. Its importance is currently boosted up due to the recent significant progress of astronomical observations, theoretical modeling, and lab experiments. The most remarkable example may be the rapid accumulation of observed extrasolar planets and the characterization of their atmospheres. These studies are interesting in the sense that they can fill out a gap in research between the solar and extrasolar planetary systems. In this talk, I will present all the key results of my latest work. These include theoretical modeling of protoplanetary disks, out of which planetary systems are born, semi-analytical modeling of chondrule formation and the origin of asteroids, and a comprehensive analysis of solid accretion onto planets and its implications for the composition of observed exoplanets. In these studies, the outcome of the recent observations and lab experiments is utilized in order to derive new!
  insights into the formation mechanisms of planets including the solar system. The combination of these attempts may enable us to move towards a comprehensive understanding of planet formation, covering a full size range from mm-sized, tiny dust grains to planetesimals and up to fully formed planets.

Speaker:    Chi-Ting Chiang (Stony Brook University)
Topic:         Simulating structure formation in different environments and the application
Time:         2/13 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
The observables of the large-scale structure such as galaxy number density generally depends on the density environment (of a few hundred Mpc). The dependence can traditionally be studied by performing gigantic cosmological N-body simulations and measuring the observables in different density environments. Alternatively, we perform the so-called "separate universe simulations", in which the effect of the environment is absorbed into the change of the cosmological parameters. For example, an overdense region is equivalent to a universe with positive curvature, hence the structure formation changes accordingly compared to the region without overdensity. In this talk, I will introduce the "separate universe mapping", and present how the power spectrum
and halo mass function change in different density environments, which are equivalent to the squeezed bispectrum and the halo bias, respectively. I will then discuss the extension of this approach to inclusion of additional fluids such as massive neutrinos. This allows us to probe the novel scale-dependence of halo bias and squeezed bispectrum caused by different evolutions of the background overdensities of cold dark matter and the additional fluid. Finally, I will present one application of the separate universe simulations to predict the squeezed bispectrum formed by small-scale Lyman-alpha forest power spectrum and large-scale lensing convergence, and compare with the measurement from BOSS Lyman-alpha forest and Planck lensing map.

Topic:         Discovery of five new, extreme double neutron star systems
Time:         2/14 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
Since the discovery of the first double neutron star system (also, the first binary pulsar), PSR B1913+16 (the famous Hulse-Taylor binary pulsar), such systems have been extremely valuable for tests of general relativity and the study of gravitational waves, decades before the LIGO detection. They have also been a great tool for studies of stellar evolution. In this talk I will present two of the most important systems known (the Hulse-Taylor and the ``Double Pulsar" system), but then emphasize the extraordinary systems discovered in the last 3 years, with a discussion of their enormous potential for advancing our knowledge of fundamental physics and stellar evolution. I then discuss some of the trends emerging from this study, particularly the correlation between the mass of the second-formed NS and the orbital eccentricity of the systems, and what this tells us about supernova astrophysics.

Dear Yi-Jehng,

I would appreciate it if you could circulate the call for SMA proposals
(standard projects for the 2018A semester) to TAN.

Regards,
Naomi

Dear Colleague,

We wish to draw your attention to the currrently open call for proposals for observations with the Submillimeter Array (SMA), the reconfigurable interferometric array of eight 6-m antennas on Mauna Kea jointly built and operated by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory and the Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics. The array operates in the 230 GHz, 345 GHz and 400 GHz bands. 

The SMA is currently accepting proposals for the 2018A observing semester (16 May, 2018 - 15 Nov, 2018) from principal investigators from the worldwide astronomical community. 

The proposal deadline is:

Thu., 8 Mar. 2018, 16:00 EST (US) 
[ Thu., 8 Mar. 2018, 11:00 HST (Hawaii)
  Thu., 8 Mar. 2018, 21:00 GMT
  Fri.,  9 Mar. 2018, 05:00 CST (Taipei) ]

The SMA has recently completed significant upgrades in observational capability, with more under way. Currently, the SMA observes simultaneously with two orthogonally polarized receivers, one in the 230 GHz or 345 GHz band and the other in the 240 GHz or 400 GHz band, with full polarimetric observations available using the 230+240 or 345+400 band combinations. The SWARM correlator processes 8 GHz bandwidth for each receiver in each sideband, for a total of 32 GHz, at a uniform 140 kHz resolution. This 32 GHz frequency coverage can be continuous where the tuning ranges overlap for the two orthogonally polarized receivers. In short, the SMA now provides flexible, wide band frequency coverage that delivers high continuum sensitivity and excellent spectral line capabilities. A full track offers continuum sensitivity of 200 or 500 micro-Jy (1 sigma) at 230 or 345 GHz in good weather conditions (precipitable water vapor 2.5mm and 1.0mm, respectively). The corresponding line sensit!
ivities at 1 km/s resolution are 30 and 70 mJy. The small antennas allow access to low spatial frequencies in the sub-compact configuration, and at the other extreme, the finest angular resolution with the very extended configuration at 345 GHz is ~ 0.25". The compact and extended configurations complete the range. Thus, in some ways, the characteristics and performance of the SMA are both similar and complementary to those of the stand-alone Atacama Compact Array (ACA) component of ALMA. 

For more information about SMA capabilities, visit the SMA Observer Center website  http://sma1.sma.hawaii.edu/ and explore the set of SMA proposing tools at  http://sma1.sma.hawaii.edu/tools.html. Current and archived SMA Newsletters available online at https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/sma/newsletter/ provide a sampling of the wide variety of science possible with the SMA.  

Instructions on proposal preparation and submission, are available at the SMA Observer Center website http://sma1.sma.hawaii.edu/. Questions or comments regarding this Call for Proposals can also be addressed to propose@sma.hawaii.edu.

Please note that the Large Scale Projects program which follows a phased development, submission and review path, has now entered the full proposal development phase and PIs who submitted Notices of Intent to propose have been intimated.
