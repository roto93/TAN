Speaker:        Zha Shuai (Chinese University of Hong Kong)
Topic:          Evolution of Super-AGB stars Towards Accretion-Induced Collapse
Time:           10/29 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
We calculated accretion-induced collapse (AIC) progenitor models starting from super- AGB stars to the ignition of oxygen burning and the start of gravitational instability, using MESA code with updated nuclear physics inputs. URCA cooling process and electron capture on 24Mg and 20Ne are modelled with the newly calculated beta rates table with fine grids provided by Suzuki et al., which gives a more accurate density threshold for the ignition of oxygen burning. Near the final moment, a convection zone is developed above the ignition point, which will alter the composition and thermal structure of AIC progenitor. This could have a significant influence on the fate of AIC, which is under intensive debate. We also point out two uncertain issues. For the case with the least massive star (8.2M_sun), an off-centre carbon-rich (2%) island of about 0.1M mass is left and will be reignited during electron capture on 24Mg. At the carbon-burning stage, the neutron capture on 24Mg nucle!
 i with the JINA reaction rates would deplete 24Mg to become 25Mg. Further improvements in the stellar evolution calculation and nuclear physics inputs are still needed for a conclusive determination on the fate of AIC.

Topic:          Type Ia supernova: Explosive nucleosynthesis and its applications
Time:           10/31 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) is an important class of supernova
because of its applications in cosmological and production of 
iron-peak elements. However, the diversity of observed SNe Ia 
shows that the possible parameter space of SNe Ia can be much larger
than we might have expected. In this talk, I will present my recent 
works done on multi-dimensional modeling of SN Ia and its explosive
nucleosynthesis. I will further discuss how the chemical abundances 
depend on the explosion models and configurations. I will discuss ]
how we can induce to the progenitors of the observed SNe Ia and the 
role of SN Ia in galactic chemical evolution.

Speaker:        Hiroya Yamaguchi (JAXA)
Topic:          X-ray studies of supernova remnants to solve the Type Ia
supernova progenitor issue
Time:           11/1 (Thursday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), widely believed to result from
thermonuclear explosions of white dwarfs (WDs), are extremely
important phenomena in the universe, owing to their roles as distance
indicators in cosmology and major sources of the Fe-peak elements (Cr,
Mn, Fe, Ni). However, many of their fundamental aspects, e.g., how
their progenitors evolve and explode, remain elusive. In this talk, I
will first review recent progress in observational and theoretical
studies toward solving this "SN Ia progenitor issue". Then I will
focus on X-ray observations of SN Ia remnants to measure abundances of
the Fe-peak elements, the key for constraining the nature of
progenitor WDs, such as the final mass and central density. I will
also discuss future prospects for high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy
of SNe Ia remnants in the XRISM and Athena era, based on the
remarkable achievements from Hitomi observations of a galaxy cluster.

Speaker:        Steve Charnley (NASA Goddard Space Flight Center)
Topic:          The Physics and Chemistry of Comets
Time:           11/2 (Friday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
I will summarize what is currently known of the chemistry of comets. Sublimation of nuclear ices near perihelion generates the coma - a multi fluid plasma whose understanding requires consideration of a variety of chemical processes. Compositional studies, from ground and space, especially of organic molecules, isotopologues, and ortho-para ratios can provide important clues as to their origins, and to their possible role in providing water and biomolecules to the early Earth
