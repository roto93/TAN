Dear all,

We will have TTTT seminar on 9 Feb. in NTHU, given by
Dr. Yuichi Higuchi, who is  a postdoc in Academia Sinica.

Title:
Probing supervoids with weak gravitational lensing

Speaker: Dr. Yuichi Higuchi

Time: 12:20pm 9th Feb. (Friday)

Venue: R501, IoA, 5th floor in the 2nd General Building

Abstract:

CMB experiments revealed that there are non-Gaussian features in the map.
An anomalous cold spot surrounded with a hot ring, called the Cold Spot is
one of such features. The temperature decrement becomes ~100 \muK across 
~10
degree on the skyplane (e.g.,Vielca et al., 2004). The anomaly can be 
explained
by the linear/non-linear integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect caused by a 
supervoid
with a radius of 200-300 Mpc/h in the local Universe. Recent photometric 
and
redshift observations showed the possibility of the existence of the 
supervoids,
while large errors such as galaxy bias and photo-z are included in the 
observations.
In order to investigate the properties of such voids with an un-biased 
method,
we propose to observe the region with weak gravitational lensing which 
can trace
baryon and dark matters on a line of sight.Through a ray-tracing 
simulation, we
investigated the prospects for detecting lensing signals from the 
supervoids and
for investigating the properties through weak gravitational lensing. We 
found that
the lensing signals can be detected at S/N>4 with on-going large weak 
lensing
surveys and we can obtain a constraint on the projected mass 
distribution of the
supervoids with these surveys.

With best regards,
Tetsuya

Dear ALMA user,

ALMA will issue its Cycle 6 Proposal Call on March 20, 2018. In response to
that, the ALMA Regional Center (Taiwan-ARC) of ASIAA will hold one day ALMA
Users Workshop. We would be grateful if you could help us to pick the best
time by filling the doodle:
https://doodle.com/poll/rcfvd4qmyxegpnhn
The doodle will be closed on February 7th (by 12 pm). Thanks a lot for your
help.

The tentative programs of the ALMA Users Workshop are:

1. ALMA Cycle 6 capability
2. Suggestions of ALMA proposal preparation
3. ALMA science portal <https://almascience.nrao.edu/>
4. Observing Tool <https://almascience.nrao.edu/proposing/observing-tool>
(OT)
5. CASA image simulation

Best,
Tien-Hao Hsieh
On behalf of Taiwan ARC node

*** Special Seminar ***
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Richard Crutcher (University of Illinois)
Topic:         Magnetic Fields and Star Formation: Observations and Implications
Time:         2/5 (Monday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
Stars are a fundamental unit of the universe, and their formation is a fundamental astrophysical process. The role of magnetic fields in star formation remains controversial today. I will discuss several molecular cloud and star formation theoretical ideas that have very different roles for magnetic fields and describe techniques for observing magnetic fields in regions of star formation.  The talk will focus on the Zeeman effect, the only technique for directly observing magnetic field strengths. I will describe specific tests of vario Stars are a fundamental unit of the universe, and their formation is a fundamental astrophysical process.
