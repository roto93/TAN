Dear all,

The speaker in the TTTT seminar in the NTHU was
switched to the colloquium this week.

Title:Â  Stellar population and weak lensing studies
in large scale multi-filter surveys

Speaker: Dr. Luis Alberto Diaz Garcia (ASIAA)

Time: 15:30pm- 9th November (Friday)

Venue: R521, IoA, 5th floor in the 2nd General Building

Abstract: Nowadays, there is an increasing number of multi-filter surveys,
including COMBO-17, COSMOS, ALHAMBRA, CLASH, SHARDS, HSC-SSP,
J-PAS, J-PLUS, each of them with a vast volume of high-quality multi-filter
data. These kinds of surveys sample the spectral energy distributions (SED)
of all the sources in the field of view using top-hat and/or broad-band 
filters.
Owing to this configuration, the retrieved SEDs are half-way between 
classical
photometry and spectroscopy. This offers an opportunity to explore several
topics in Astronomy and Cosmology in an unprecedented way. After a brief
introduction of the main features of the ongoing ALHAMBRA, HSC-SSP,
J-PLUS, and J-PAS surveys, I will present how these surveys open a pathway
to advance in our understanding of galaxy evolution. More precisely, how
they can be used to explore the stellar content of quiescent galaxies from
the nearby Universe up to intermediate redshifts. Finally, I will 
briefly show
that studies involving both J-PAS and HSC-SSP photometric data can be
very fruitful and promising for future projects on weak lensing.

With best regards,
Tetsuya Hashimoto

Dear Yi-Jehng,

I would appreciate it if you could circulat this annoucement to TAN.

â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”

Dear colleague,

Here is the announcement of the workshop "Dynamics and physics of outflows 
in protostellar disks and active galactic nucleiâ€  that will be held on Jan. 13 & 14,
2019 in Kagoshima University.
The deadline for registration & abstract submission is Nov. 30.

Regards,
Naomi

"Dynamics and physics of outflows in protostellar disks and active galactic nuclei"

data:   2019, 1/13  9:00-  1/14 17:00
Placeï¼šã€€Kagoshima University
Invited speakersï¼š   
   Prof. S. Aalto (Onsala Space Observatory, Sweden), 
   Prof.  M. Machida (Kyushu University)
   Dr. T. Izumi (National Astronomical Observatory of Japan)
   Dr. S. Takasao (Nagoya University )

SOC:   K. Wada (Kagoshima), T. Izumi (NAOJ), M. Machida
LOC:   K. Wada

Purpose:  This workshop will be held a part of the kick-off symposium for the Amanoga Galaxy Astronomy Research Center, which will start on 1 January 2019
as a new research institute of Kagoshima University.   This workshop aims to exchange recent observational and theoretical progress in
a field of molecular outflows in protostars and AGNs. Since both phenomena have some physical and observational similarities, it is worth discussing recent findings by ALMA and theoretical studies
in both fields. We hope that this workshop is a beginning of
a future collaboration between the two phenomena on very different scales.

Speaker:        Hsi-An Pan (ASIAA)
Topic:          Mergers in MaNGA: Visual Classification of Merging Sequence and Preliminary Results of Spatially-Resolved SFR of Mergers
Time:           11/12 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Among the ~4700 MaNGA galaxies, we identified ~1300 potential galaxy pairs and mergers based on their spectroscopic companions or morphologies. We have devised scheme for classifying the stage of an interaction based on the morphological appearance of the system. The effect of interactions on SFR is quantified by computing the global and spatially-resolved SFR relative to the control galaxies and spaxels. The preliminary results show that although the global SFR enhancement increases with merging sequence, there is considerable variation in the radial profile of local SFR enhancement across the stages.



*** Colloquium ***

Speaker:        Min-Kai Lin (ASIAA)
Topic:          Dust dynamics in protoplanetary disks
Time:           11/14 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Planet formation takes place inside disks of gas and dust around young stars --- protoplanetary disks (PPDs). While the dust component only makes up about one per cent of the total disk mass, it underpins planet formation from both theoretical and observational perspectives. In this talk, I describe our recent work on dust dynamics in PPDs. I will present a simplified framework to model the complex dynamics of dust-gas interaction, by drawing on n analogy between dusty-gas and pure gas dynamics. I then demonstrate several applications of this new approach, including a new analytical understanding of the `streaming instability' for planetesimal formation; numerical simulations of dust-settling in turbulent PPDs; and the interaction between low mass protoplanets and dusty disks. Implications for planet formation and future work will be discussed.
