Panchromatic Panoramic Studies of Galaxy Clusters: from HSC to PFS and ULTIMATE
March 11-13, 2019
ASIAA, Taipei, Taiwan
https://events.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/workshop/20190311/index.php


Owing to its large aperture and wide field-of-view, Subaru telescope
has played key roles in advancing our understanding of the formation
and evolution of galaxy clusters. With the 300-night Hyper Suprime-Cam
(HSC) survey, the largest ever undertaking of Subaru, the HSC
collaboration is conducting a unique survey of all key phases in the
lives of clusters. The deep and wide areal coverage and the superb
imaging quality have enabled us to publish the first large sample of
shear-selected clusters, as well as the largest distant cluster and
proto-cluster samples at z>1.

As a prelude to the second public data release of the HSC survey, we
will hold a 3-day workshop on March 11-13, 2019 at Institute of
Astronomy and Astrophysics, Academia Sinica (ASIAA) in Taipei, which
is part of the Subaru International Partnership workshop series.
Researchers working in all aspects of cluster science are cordially
invited to participate in the workshop, where latest results from the
HSC survey will be presented. The workshop will be a venue for
presenting and discussing results from all large-scale cluster
surveys, as well as for brainstorming and preparation for cluster
studies with the upcoming instruments on Subaru and other telescopes,
such as Prime Focus Spectrograph, ULTIMATE-Subaru, AdvACT, SPT-3G,
DESI, eROSITA, Euclid, Moons, LSST, WFIRST, and 30-meter class
telescopes.

The topics of the workshop include:
* The HSC cluster samples
* Galaxy evolution in clusters
* Cosmology with clusters
* Challenges and new ideas in cluster detection and characterization
* Multi-wavelength studies of clusters
* Prospects with future facilities.
We shall also have discussion sessions on themes such as "Cluster mass
calibration", "Machine learning in cluster detection".

The registration is now open. We particularly welcome scientists
interested in collaborating with the HSC survey team to join the
workshop, where the number of participants is limited to 50. Limited
travel funding is available to early-career scientists. There is no
registration fee for the workshop.
