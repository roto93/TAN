Dear all,

The speaker in the TTTT seminar in the NTHU was
switched to the colloquium this week.

Title:Ã‚  Stellar population and weak lensing studies
in large scale multi-filter surveys

Speaker: Dr. Luis Alberto Diaz Garcia (ASIAA)

Time: 15:30pm- 9th November (Friday)

Venue: R521, IoA, 5th floor in the 2nd General Building

Abstract: Nowadays, there is an increasing number of multi-filter surveys,
including COMBO-17, COSMOS, ALHAMBRA, CLASH, SHARDS, HSC-SSP,
J-PAS, J-PLUS, each of them with a vast volume of high-quality multi-filter
data. These kinds of surveys sample the spectral energy distributions (SED)
of all the sources in the field of view using top-hat and/or broad-band 
filters.
Owing to this configuration, the retrieved SEDs are half-way between 
classical
photometry and spectroscopy. This offers an opportunity to explore several
topics in Astronomy and Cosmology in an unprecedented way. After a brief
introduction of the main features of the ongoing ALHAMBRA, HSC-SSP,
J-PLUS, and J-PAS surveys, I will present how these surveys open a pathway
to advance in our understanding of galaxy evolution. More precisely, how
they can be used to explore the stellar content of quiescent galaxies from
the nearby Universe up to intermediate redshifts. Finally, I will 
briefly show
that studies involving both J-PAS and HSC-SSP photometric data can be
very fruitful and promising for future projects on weak lensing.

With best regards,
Tetsuya Hashimoto
