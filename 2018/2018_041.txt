*** Colloquium ***

Speaker:    Fernando Olguin (NTHU)
Topic:         Determining the physical properties of the massive YSO AFGL 2591
Time:         3/28 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
The distribution of matter around massive proto-stars tells us which are the physical processes dominating the formation of massive stars. These physical processes can in turn help us to determine whether massive stars are formed as an upscale version of their low-mass counterparts. We can limit the effects of some physical by studying massive young stellar objects (MYSOs) which are where the ionising nature of the radiation from the massive star has not started to change the circumstellar environment. One of the most observed MYSOs is AFGL 2591, which has similar properties to those found in other MYSOs (e.g. jets/outflows) and it is relatively isolated. In this presentation, I will show the latest results of our multi-wavelength dust continuum study of the density and temperature structure of this source and molecular line emission study of its envelope kinematics. In particular, I will show how our radiative transfer modelling explains resolved Herschel 70 micron data, an!
d evidence of rotation in the inner envelope as mapped by methyl cyanide emission.
