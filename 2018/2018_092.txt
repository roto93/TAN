Workshop 2018=E2=80=9D to be held on December 14 - 15 (at Osaka Prefecture
University), and the =E2=80=9CEast Asian ALMA Science Workshop 2018=E2=80=
=9D to be held on
December 17 - 19 (at the I-site Namba in Osaka). This is the annual joint
ALMA science/development workshop that involves all three East Asian ALMA
partners (Japan, Taiwan and Korea).

Registration will begin in early September, 2018.

The main goal of the workshop is to discuss and identify development items
that are critical in the long term development and operation of the ALMA
telescope.  The topic of this year's workshop is =E2=80=9Cwide IF=E2=80=9D.=
  Since the
hardware/software development is intimately connected to future science
requirements, active participation by scientists is highly encouraged.

We note that the annual =E2=80=9CEast Asia Sub-millimeter-wave Receiver Tec=
hnology
Workshop=E2=80=9D will be held on December 11-13 in the Kanasai area.
