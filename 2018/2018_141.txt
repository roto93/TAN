Dear all,

We will have TTTT seminar at NTHU on 25 Sep. given by
Hiroyuki Ikeda in National Astronomical Observatory of Japan.

Title:
High redshift Quasar Surveys and Black Hole Measurements of
Supermassive Black Holes

Speaker: Hiroyuki Ikeda

Time: 15:20-16:10pm 25th Sep. (Tuesday)

Venue: R521, IoA, 5th floor in the 2nd General Building

Abstract: In order to understand the evolution of supermassive
black holes (SMBHs), many quasars (or active galactic nuclei: AGN)
have been discovered up to z~7 by the various quasar surveys.
Utilizing these quasar sample, the quasar (AGN) luminosity functions
(QLFs) have been derived up to z~6 over a wide range of luminosity
and confirmed that the whole shape of the QLFs are well fitted by
the double power-law function over a wide range of redshift. As
described below, to understand the accurate evolution of SMBHs,
it is also important to investigate the physical properties of quasars
such as the black hole mass (M_BH) and Eddington ratio (L/L_Edd)
of SMBHs. Motivated by the above situations, we have searched for
quasars at high redshift and measured M_BH and L/L_Edd. In this talk,
I will show you the basic lecture about the quasar search and M_BH
measurements. Then, I will talk about our recent results of quasar
surveys and the M_BH measurements of quasars.

With best regards,
Tetsuya Hashimoto
