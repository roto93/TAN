Speaker:        Ruolan Jin (NTHU)
Topic:          What can the X-ray population study of a galaxy tell us?
Time:           10/15 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
X-ray population study of a galaxy has long been viewed as an important way of reflecting the environment of the galaxy as well as providing clues of its revolution. I will introduce the basics of the X-ray population study of a galaxy and what should be taken into account while analyzing it\.



*** Special Seminar ***
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:        Ting-Wen Lan (IPMU)
Topic:          Probing the circumgalactic medium with the SDSS
Time:           10/16 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Gas around galaxies, the circumgalactic medium (CGM), contains signatures of galactic outflows and gas accretion, which are crucial processes driving the evolution of galaxies. To better understand these processes, one can investigate the physical properties of the CGM via its absorption line signatures imprinted in the spectra of background quasars. In this talk, I will present the latest results of the CGM properties as well as its connection with galaxies probed by making use of the largest spectroscopic dataset provided by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. I will show that (1) the metallicity of the circumgalactic gas evolves consistently with the metal production of the Universe and reaches the solar value at redshift ~1; (2) the metals are carried by small dense clouds with the sizes ~10 pc; (3) the spatial distribution and kinematics of the gas around galaxies strongly correlate with the star formation activity of the central galaxies. These findings uncover a new picture!
 : the CGM is enriched by galactic outflows, consisting of ~10^6 metal-rich gas clouds --- a non-negligible amount revealed for the first time.



*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:        Jordi Miralda-Escude (University of Barcelona)
Topic:          Large-scale Correlations from absorption spectra: the Lyman alpha
forest power spectrum and the cross-power with quasars, DLAs and metal
absorption systems.
Time:           10/17 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Modern surveys of absorption spectra of hundreds of thousands of
quasars at z>2 have opened a new method to study the large-scale structure
of the Universe at high redshift. The Lyman alpha forest traces density
fluctuations of intergalactic gas, and damped Lyman alpha systems and metal
lines trace halos hosting galaxy formation. Absorption systems are
large-scale structure tracers with a linear bias factor that can be measured
and compared to model predictions. The BOSS survey measurements of the Lyman
alpha forest power spectrum and cross-power with quasars, DLAs and metal
absorbers will be presented, and their implications for theories of the
intergalactic medium and galaxy formation will be summarized.

We would like to remind you that the deadline of the registration for
"East-Asia AGN Workshop 2019" is approaching, that is 1st November.
If you need a hotel room during the workshop, we would recommend
participants to stay Howard International House that is located in a
walking distance from the workshop venue. For staying this hotel,
the registered persons should book a room by themselves through
the URL shown in the "local info" page of the workshop website.
We encourage PRC passport holders to register and contact ASIAA
as early as possible, in order to apply for a travel permit to Taiwan.
