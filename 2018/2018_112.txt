Topic:        MHD simulations on the formation of Fermi Bubbles with magnetic field
Time:        7/30 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:          R1203
Abstract:
Fermi bubbles, black hole feedback in our Galaxy, is a huge structure in our Galactic halo. One possible origin of the bubbles is repeated star captures by the supermassive black hole at the Galactic center. We model these processes as multiple energy outbursts (a.k.a. explosions) from a small volume into a layered exponential atmosphere. We study the formation of the bubbles by the MHD simulation code FLASH4. The evolution and morphology of the bubbles is compared under different initial poloidal and toroidal magnetic field configurations.



*** Colloquium ***

Speaker:    Rob Wittenmyer (University of Southern Queensland)
Topic:        New frontiers in exoplanetary and stellar astrophysics with Australian
observational facilities
Time:        8/1 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:          R1203
Abstract:
Mount Kent Observatory at the University of Southern Queensland is host
to Australia's newest astronomical research facilities.
MINERVA-Australis is the only Southern hemisphere precise radial
velocity facility wholly dedicated to follow-up of thousands of planets
to be identified by NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey satellite
(TESS). Mass measurements of these planets are critically necessary to
maximise the scientific impact of the TESS mission, to understand the
composition of exoplanets and the transition between rocky and gaseous
worlds. MINERVA-Australis is now operational. I present first-light
results and give an update on the status of the project, which will
ultimately host six 0.7m telescopes feeding a stabilised spectrograph.

The Stellar Observations Network Group (SONG) is establishing a node at
Mount Kent. SONG-Australia will complete the global longitude coverage,
delivering breakthroughs in fundamental understanding of the interiors
of stars for decades to come. SONG-Australia is designed on a "MINERVA"
model, whereby fibres from multiple small telescopes feed a single
high-resolution spectrograph. This approach provides expandability and
reduces cost by using factory-built components that have been
well-tested by the MINERVA teams. As a result of these innovations,
SONG-Australia is expected to be fully operational by late 2019.

Topic:        Universality of the IMF? Peak and slope
Time:        8/2 (Thursday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:          R1203
Abstract:
The initial mass function (IMF) is suggested by observations to be universal in spite of the wide variety of star-forming environments. Several major physical mechanisms, such as thermal energy, turbulence, gravity, magnetic field, and radiation, are governing the formation of the stars, or even before that, the formation of the prestellar cores. I will first discuss the possible impact of initial conditions on the mass spectrum of stars forming inside clusters. The observations suggest a high-mass end slope of -1.3 for the IMF, while this does not seem to have been readily reproduced by any of the present day simulations. A series of numerical experiments was performed with a wide range of initial density, turbulent energy level, and magnetic field strength. We compare the stellar mass spectrum outcome to the prediction adapted from the gravo-turbulent fragmentation model of Hennebelle and Chabrier (2009). The IMF from simulations is well reproduced with a powerlaw density !
PDF, that is often observed in collapsing clumps. Nonetheless, a shallower slope is suggested. On the other hand, the simulations exhibit a lower mass limit that truncates the mass spectrum in extremely dense environments, giving a peak of the distribution that is independent of the large-scale conditions. We propose a mechanism to explain the peak of the IMF using a combination of the tidal forces and the thermodynamics of the first Larson core. A characteristic mass of 10 times the mass of the first Larson core, that is, around 0.2 solar masses, is robustly predicted. These results suggest that, the universality of the IMF is probably true only under certain circumstances, or possibly it is the initial conditions and local physics that are universal and some particular conditions are not so common!
