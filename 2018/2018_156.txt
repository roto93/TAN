> The SPace Infrared telescope for Cosmology and Astrophysics (SPICA) mission is selected as one of ESAâ€™s fifth medium class mission in its Cosmic Vision science programme in May 2018. In SPICA, ASIAA partners with JAXA to develop the SPICA Mid-infrared Instrument (SMI) and the science program associate with it. It is important to regain our momentum on the science activities and technical development after the M5 phase A selection.

Panchromatic Panoramic Studies of Galaxy Clusters: from HSC to PFS and ULTIMATE
March 11-13, 2019
ASIAA, Taipei, Taiwan
https://events.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/workshop/20190311/index.php


Owing to its large aperture and wide field-of-view, Subaru telescope
has played key roles in advancing our understanding of the formation
and evolution of galaxy clusters. With the 300-night Hyper Suprime-Cam
(HSC) survey, the largest ever undertaking of Subaru, the HSC
collaboration is conducting a unique survey of all key phases in the
lives of clusters. The deep and wide areal coverage and the superb
imaging quality have enabled us to publish the first large sample of
shear-selected clusters, as well as the largest distant cluster and
proto-cluster samples at z>1.

As a prelude to the second public data release of the HSC survey, we
will hold a 3-day workshop on March 11-13, 2019 at Institute of
Astronomy and Astrophysics, Academia Sinica (ASIAA) in Taipei, which
is part of the Subaru International Partnership workshop series.
Researchers working in all aspects of cluster science are cordially
invited to participate in the workshop, where latest results from the
HSC survey will be presented. The workshop will be a venue for
presenting and discussing results from all large-scale cluster
surveys, as well as for brainstorming and preparation for cluster
studies with the upcoming instruments on Subaru and other telescopes,
such as Prime Focus Spectrograph, ULTIMATE-Subaru, AdvACT, SPT-3G,
DESI, eROSITA, Euclid, Moons, LSST, WFIRST, and 30-meter class
telescopes.

The topics of the workshop include:
* The HSC cluster samples
* Galaxy evolution in clusters
* Cosmology with clusters
* Challenges and new ideas in cluster detection and characterization
* Multi-wavelength studies of clusters
* Prospects with future facilities.
We shall also have discussion sessions on themes such as "Cluster mass
calibration", "Machine learning in cluster detection".

The registration is now open. We particularly welcome scientists
interested in collaborating with the HSC survey team to join the
workshop, where the number of participants is limited to 50. Limited
travel funding is available to early-career scientists. There is no
registration fee for the workshop.

*** Special Seminar ***
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:        Zhi-Yun Li (University of Virginia)
Topic:          Protostellar Disks: Dust Polarization and Formation of Rings and Gaps
Time:           10/8 (Monday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
In the first part of the talk, I will discuss the origins of the  polarization of dust continuum emission from young star disks, with  emphasis on scattering by large grains. The scattering-induced  polarization provides a probe of grain growth in disks that is the first   step towards the formation of planetesimals and ultimately planets. In   the second part, I will discuss the formation of rings and gaps in  magnetized wind-launching disks that are weakly ionized, with emphasis  on a new mechanism that relies on the reconnection of highly pinched  magnetic fields to produce regions magnetized to different levels. More   magnetized regions tend to accrete faster, forming gaps, whereas less   magnetized regions accrete more slowly, allowing matter to accumulate   into dense rings. Implications of the rings and gaps formed through  this  mechanism for the dynamics and size evolution of dust grains will  be  briefly discussed.



*** ASIAA/NTU Joint Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:        Jordi Miralda-Escude (University of Barcelona)
Topic:          Clues to the small-scale mass distribution of the dark matter probed by
gravitational lensing
Time:           10/9 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           CCMS R104
Abstract:
Dark matter continues to pose one of the most important questions in
modern cosmology. Gravitationally lensed multiple images of galaxies, quasars
and stars provide several opportunities for testing the clumpiness of dark
matter on small scales due to, for example, compact objects, axion
mini-clusters and waves, or subhalos orbiting on galactic or cluster dark matter
halos. The idea of using highly magnified stars by lensing clusters to probe
this small-scale granularity in the dark matter will be discussed.



*** Special Seminar ***
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:        Tomomi Sunayama (Kavli IPMU)
Topic:          Testing Halo Assembly Bias using Galaxy Clusters
Time:           10/11 (Thursday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Halo assembly bias is a phenomenon that the clustering of halos exhibits a dependence on additional properties beyond their halo mass (such as formation time and concentration). Halo assembly bias has been observed in simulations but not in observations. Recently, Miyatake et al. 2015 reported the observational detection of halo assembly bias using redMaPPer galaxy clusters; however, their observed signal was much larger than the expected signal from N-body simulations. Since then, there have been a couple of researches claiming that their detection of assembly bias is due to projection effects. In this work, we implement the redMaPPer-like algorithm, which can be applied to the simulations so that we can do more direct comparisons between simulations and observations, and we study whether the observational detection of assembly bias is truly due to projection effects or not.



*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:        Maria Murga (Russian Academy of Sciences)
Topic:          Evolution of small carbonaceous dust grains in photodissociation regions
Time:           10/12 (Friday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
This talk is devoted to the picture of evolution of small carbonaceous grains
in conditions of photodissociation regions (PDRâ€™s): from dense cold molec-
ular cloud to ionised region with enhanced ionisation field. Also, a brief re-
view of experimental and theoretical studies on carbon compounds will be
made in the talk. 
>
Carbonaceous species are highly allotropic, they may have different
structures. This property is widely investigated in laboratories and is used
in industry. PDRâ€™s are kind of space laboratories where modifications of
carbonaceous species occur. Large swings of conditions in PDRâ€™s
(temperature, ionisation field, gas and dust density, etc.) on small scale
promote to these modifications. Almost all types of carbonaceous species
can be traced across PDRâ€™s: from amorphous carbons to fullerenes. That is
why PDRâ€™s are very interesting and important objects for investigation of
carbonaceous species.
>
Astrophysical observations of PDRâ€™s such as Orion Bar, Horsehead, NGC
7023 give opportunity for checking theoretical ideas of photo-processing of
carbonaceous species. It is possible to follow its evolutionary changes at
different conditions within a single object through mid-infrared (IR) emission
bands. Observational variations of the mid-IR bands (at 3.3-3.4, 6.2, 7.7,
8.6, 11.2 mkm) indicate changes in dust size and structure, ionisation stage
and fraction of grains with aliphatic bonds. The observations of abundance
of some small hydrocarbons (C2H, C4H, c-C3H2, l-C3H, etc.) may tell us
about photo-destruction of carbonaceous macromolecules under high ul-
traviolet field.
