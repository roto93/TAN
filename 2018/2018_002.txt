*** Special Seminar ***
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Tom Broadhurst (University of the Basque Country)
Topic:         Fundamental Physics from the First Detections of Cosmological Neutrinos, Axions and Gravitational Waves
Time:         1/9 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
I will present the first direct evidence that the ubiquitous Dark Matter includes a small fraction of massive neutrinos (0.11eV summed over 3 flavours), with the rest composed of light axions (10^{-22}eV) in a Bose-Einstein state, motivated by String Theory. We have made the first cosmological simulations in this context, demonstrating the vast network of structure in the Universe is a beautiful interference pattern, with a standing solitonic wave at the center of every galaxy, representing the ground state. We have detected such a dark soliton in new detailed measurements of stars and gas at the center of our Galaxy.

Furthermore, the LIGO motivated  "primordial black hole" interpretation of the Dark Matter is excluded by our new Hubble Space Telescope discovery of individual stars detected through the huge intervening columns of dark matter in galaxy clusters.  Instead, these gravitational wave sources can be better interpreted as cosmologically distant, lower mass colliding black holes of stellar origin, that are lensed by intervening galaxies.



*** Colloquium ***

Speaker:    Takaya Nozawa (NAOJ)
Topic:         Consensus and issues on dust formation in supernovae
Time:         1/10 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
The role of core-collapse supernovae (SNe) as sources of cosmic dust
is the key to understanding the dust enrichment history in the universe.
Far-infrared and submillimeter observations with Herschel and ALMA
have revealed the presence of cool dust above 0.1 Msun in the ejecta
of SNe, which is in good agreement with masses of newly formed dust
predicted by theoretical studies. However, there remain two unsettled
issues: formation time and survivability of dust. Observationally, there
seems a growing pieces of evidence that dust mass gradually increases
with time over 20 years. However, we see from a simple argument that
this is not easy to be realized. On the other hand, the survivability of
dust against destruction by the reverse shock, which is critical to know
the final amount of dust ejection form SNe, is also hard to be evaluated
observationally. In particular, it depends on the initial size distribution
of dust, which is not constrained very well from infrared observations.
In this talk, I will introduce some recent approaches that address these
issues, and attempt to discuss how we can tackle them from now on.

Topic:         Modeling Cosmic Extremes: Hypermagnetized White Dwarfs and Accretion Disks
Time:         1/11 (Thursday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
In this talk, I aim to establish the important role played by ultra-strong magnetic fields to explain diverse astrophysical phenomena. First, I will talk about my doctoral thesis work on hypermagnetized white dwarfs. Such white dwarfs have strong interior magnetic fields greater than 4.4 x
10^{13} G, which introduce quantum mechanical effects, and also provide
additional pressure support against gravity, yielding highly
super-Chandrasekhar white dwarfs in the range 1.7-3.4 Msun. I arrived at
this conclusion by systematically progressing from a simple, spherically
symmetric, Newtonian model to a rigorous, non-spherical, general
relativistic model. Hypermagnetized white dwarfs have several important
astrophysical implications, the most compelling being their role as the
plausible progenitors of peculiar, highly over-luminous type Ia supernovae
(SNeIa). These SNeIa violate conventional Chandrasekhar-mass explosion
scenarios and seem to invoke white
dwarf progenitors having mass greater than 2 Msun. Finally, I will talk
about my current work on modeling the global properties of hypermagnetized
accretion disks. Local magnetohydrodynamic simulations of accretion flows
have shown that in the presence of a sufficiently strong but subthermal
(plasma-\beta = Pgas/Pmag > 1) vertical magnetic flux, a large-scale,
suprathermal toroidal field (plasma-\beta < 1) is generated, which becomes
the dominant source of pressure support in the disk. I term such
magnetically dominated disks as hypermagnetized accretion disks, which can
resolve several observational
shortcomings of the standard, geometrically thin, accretion disk model. I
have performed a global, linear stability analysis of  hypermagnetized
accretion disks, whose results partly confirm the predictions of a local
model. However, it also reveals important differences that highlight the
necessity of a global treatment to accurately capture the geometric
curvature terms, which are otherwise neglected in weak-field studies of
accretion flows.

Topic:         Stellar population and star formation histories of star-forming regions
Time:         1/12 (Friday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
The interaction between massive ionizing sources (O and early B-type) with their natal
molecular environment plays a constructive role of new generation star formation via. various
mechanisms e.g., Radiation Driven Implosion, collect & collapse process etc. The aim of this
colloquium is to understand some aspects of interaction of high and low mass stars with their
environment on the basis of observational evidences of massive ionizing sources, young stellar
contents and molecular/ionized gas properties. The young T Tauri stars show various types of
complex profiles on the infrared emission due to disk around them, strong emission lines on
their spectra, strong flux variation due to spot signatures. The characterization of those
phenomena could be directly addressed to the properties of these young stars, and also helps

to pick up the young population in a young cluster against the field population. Thus, multi-
wavelength studies of star-forming regions (SFRs) provide census of YSOs, their fundamental

parameters e.g. masses, ages, effective temperatures, circumstellar disks around them etc.

From such parameter space, broad pictures emerge on the young star-forming regions like star-
formation history, star-formation efficiency, timescales etc. We studied the stellar contents and

star formation activities of three distant Galactic SFRs (e.g. NGC 2282, Sh2-149 complex,
Cygnus OB7) using deep optical, near-Infrared, mid-Infrared and radio continuum observations.
We estimated the stellar content of NGC 2282, a young cluster in the Monoceros constellation,

using deep optical BVI and IPHAS photometry along with IR data from UKIDSS and Spitzer-
IRAC. With the aim of investigating star formation mechanism, we studied the Galactic H II

region Sh2-149 and associated molecular clouds with the help of optical spectra, CFHT-
WIRCAM, FCRAO 12CO(1-0), JCMT 13CO(3-2). Adiitionally, we performed CCD I-band time

series photometry of a young cluster NGC 2282 and Lynds 1003 cloud in Cygnus OB7 to
identify and characterize the variability of pre main-sequence stars.
