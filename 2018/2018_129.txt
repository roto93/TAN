We are pleased to announce the opening of the registration for the
"East-Asia AGN Workshop 2019", which will be held on January 21-23,
2019 at ASIAA in Taipei, Taiwan.  The registration will remain open
until November 1, 2018.  We encourage PRC passport holders to register
and contact ASIAA as early as possible, in order to apply for a travel
permit to Taiwan.  We have reserved a block of rooms with a discount
rate in a hotel close to ASIAA.  Please register and make the hotel
reservation early, by yourself.  Please visit our website for the

*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Hirai, Yutaka (RIKEN)
Topic:         Chemodynamical evolution of dwarf galaxies â€” the enrichment of heavy elements
Time:         8/29 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
Abundances of heavy elements in metal-poor stars help us understand the origin of elements and evolutionary histories of galaxies. Recent astronomical high-dispersion spectroscopic observations have shown that there are characteristic features of the abundances of heavy elements. Neutron-capture elements such as Sr, Ba, and Eu have star-to-star scatters in extremely metal-poor stars. On the other hand, there is an increasing trend toward lower metallicity in the abundances of Zn. However, astrophysical sites and enrichment of these elements are not well understood. In this talk, I discuss the enrichment of heavy elements using high-resolution N-body/SPH simulations of dwarf galaxies. I show that neutron star mergers can be the astrophysical sites of neutron-capture elements. I also present abundance of heavy elements can be indicators of star formation histories and metal mixing of galaxies.
