>> Exploring the Infrared Universe: The Promise of SPICA
>> Crete, Greece
>> 20-23 May 2019
>> http://www.spica2019.org/
>> Deadline for abstracts: 2018 December 1
>> 
>> 
>> We now invite the community to submit abstracts for contributed talks and posters for the conference "Exploring the Infrared Universe: The Promise of SPICA". We welcome contributions with clear connections to SPICA, and are very interested in contributions that can help to finalize the design of SPICA,  and to strengthen or augment the SPICA science case.

>> Science rationale:
>> 
>> The infrared wavelength range is key to understand the origin and evolution of galaxies, stars and planetary systems, which are obscured by dust during a large part of their life cycles. With a large cold mirror and a sensitive suite of instruments, SPICA, recently selected as a candidate for ESAâ€™s Cosmic Visions program, stands poised to revolutionize these fields by providing ultra-deep spectroscopy in the 12-230 Âµm range, as well as imaging (17-37 Âµm and 100-350 Âµm) and polarimetry (100-350 Âµm). With launch planned for 2030, SPICA will provide a huge leap in capabilities over previous infrared space missions, and complement current and upcoming facilities, filling the spectral gap between JWST and ALMA. We would like to invite the international astronomical community to participate in the conference, Exploring the Infrared Universe: The Promise of SPICA, which will take place on the island of Crete on 20-23 May 2019.  At this conference, participants will learn a!
 bout the capabilities and current design of SPICA, which includes a significant Guest Observer program, while discussing the exciting scientific promise of the mission. Up to date information about the SPICA mission and its instruments can be found at http://www.spica-mission.org, in addition to links to a set of whitepapers recently published in the journal PASA, that focus on some of the science enabled by SPICA.
