[Introduction]
This is a school on theories and observations of astrophysical 
black-hole systems. Black holes make themselves detectable in 
electromagnetic waves by forming accretion disks in their surroundings 
and sometimes producing outflow jets. Observations across the whole 
electromagnetic spectrum on X-ray binaries and Active Galactic Nuclei 
(AGN) have revealed many fascinating phenomena related to the strong 
gravity and fast spin of the central black holes, to the physics of 
accretion flows, and to the formation and collimation of jets. 
Theoretical efforts in past decades have also led to deeper 
understanding of all these subjects.
    We are very pleased to hold this school on ‘Accretion and Emission 
of Accreting Black Holes’ and cordially invite all interested students 
and colleagues to join us. We believe participants will be inspired by 
wonderful lectures of our invited speakers and by interactions during 
the school. We also expect research collaborations to be initiated. All 
of you are welcome.

Dear astronomers,

We announce "East-Asia AGN Workshop 2019", which will be held on 21-23 =
January 2019 at ASIAA in Taipei Taiwan. This is the 6th meeting of a =
series of workshops focused on the AGN/SMBH field. The East-Asia AGN =
Workshop aims at fostering close collaborations among the scientists in =
East Asia. Given the rich array of research facilities accessible by EA =
astronomers, i.e., ALMA, JCMT, KaVA, Subaru, Gemini, etc, as well as the =
future facilities including TMT and GMT, it becomes more important to =
network and develop research collaborations among EA astronomers. This =
workshop will provide an interesting opportunity to learn the exciting =
scientific results on AGN/SMBH, and to build up new collaborations among =
EA astronomers. Due to the increase of the number of participants, we =
plan to host a three full day workshop in January 2019.

Speaker:    Hsi-An Pan (ASIAA)
Topic:         Molecular Gas in Interacting Galaxies
Time:         6/11 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
Galaxy interactions and mergers are often accompanied by an increase in star formation rate (SFR). Since the  properties of the molecular gas are essential for star formation, it is vital to establish whether, and by how much, galaxy interaction affects the molecular gas properties, and that in turn lead to the change in SFR. We investigate the influence of galaxy interactions on global molecular gas properties by studying a sample of 61 interacting galaxies, and compare their gas properties with galaxy-properties-matched control sample (isolated galaxies).  We find that SFR, gas mass, and gas fraction are gradually enhanced with respect to the control sample as two galaxies approaching each other, and also enhanced from minor to major mergers. On the other hand, dependence of gas star formation efficiency on merger properties is less obvious. According to our analysis, we conclude that galaxy interaction can modify the  molecular gas properties  of a galaxy,  although the s!
trength of the influence is merger properties dependent. Moreover, on the galaxy-wide scale, the total gas content, but not SFE, plays a more important role in the interaction-triggered SFR.



*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Shingo Hirano (Kyushu University)
Topic:         Formation of first stars with ten to one million solar-masses
Time:         6/13 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
First stars (Population III stars) play vital roles in the early cosmic evolution by initiating cosmic reionization and chemical enrichment of the intergalactic medium. The characteristic mass of first stars and its initial mass function are thus essential to understand the formation and evolution of the first galaxy, one of the important observational targets by the next-generation telescopes. The numerous theoretical/numerical works suggest various paths of first star formation and final masses depending on the star-forming environment properties. A large cosmological sample of first star formation shows a wide range of stellar masses from 10 to 1000 Msun depending on the properties of the star-forming gas cloud. Under a quite limited condition, very massive first stars can form with 1e5-1e6 Msun and leave a promising seed for the formation of observed high-z quasars. Furthermore, a recent study shows the formation of the first star clusters and massive star binaries. The !
eventual formation of the remnant black holes will leave a close binary of massive black holes, which can be a progenitor of strong gravitational wave sources. This talk will introduce these latest results and prospects on the formation theory of first stars.
