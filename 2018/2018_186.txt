Speaker:        Gabriel Torrealba (ASIAA)
Topic:          The discovery of the most diffuse galaxy in the Universe
Time:           11/19 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:           R1203


*** Special Seminar ***

Speaker:        Joshua Yao-Yu Lin (UIUC)
Topic:          Hunting for dark matter substructure in Strong lensing with Neural networks
Time:           11/20 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Dark Matter Substructures are interesting since they can reveal the
properties of dark matter, especially the cold dark matter small-scale
problems such as missing satellites problem. In recent years, it has
become possible to detect individual dark matter subhalos near images
of strongly lensed extended background galaxies. In this talk, I would
discuss the possibility of using deep neural networks to detect
dark matter subhalos, and showing some preliminary result with simulated data.



*** Colloquium ***

Speaker:        Re'em Sari (Hebrew University of Jerusalem)
Topic:          Dynamics at the Galactic Center: Super Massive Black hole and Millions of Stars
Time:           11/21 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
The center of our galaxy hosts a super massive black hole, four millions times the mass of our own Sun. How did it came to be, and how does it influence our galaxy? Millions of stars orbit around it. What is their fate? Some explode dramatically when they get too close to the black hole, some get ejected from the galaxy at tremendous velocities and some get swallowed by the black hole. We discuss these processes, their rates at the galactic center and other galaxies and their connection with future detection of low frequency gravitational waves.



*** Special Seminar ***

Speaker:        Jane Luu (MIT)
Topic:          'Oumuamua, an Interstellar Visitor
Time:           11/23 (Friday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
On October 19 2017, the Pan-STARRS telescope in Hawaii discovered an unusual fast moving object.  Given the name 'Oumuamua, the object was traveling on a hyperbolic orbit, which meant the object was not gravitationally bound to the Sun, but came from another planetary system.  The object soon returned to interstellar space after its brief visit.  This talk will describe what is remarkable (and unremarkable) about the object.
