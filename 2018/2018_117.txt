in the following website.
http://www.nro.nao.ac.jp/~nro45mrt/html/prop/index.html

Observation preparation and procedure with the 45-m telescope and data reduction etc. are also available
in the following website.
https://www.nro.nao.ac.jp/~nro45mrt/html/index-e.html

- Large programs (> 200 hr) over up to 2 yrs will be offered.
- Short programs (<20 hr) will be offered also in Semester 2018A and 2018B.
- Observations in On-On mode can be performed with FOREST receiver.
- OTF dump time is allowed to be not only 0.1 seconds but 0.04 seconds as well.
- Japan domestic remote observation other than Mitaka may be possible as risk-shared.
- Remote observation from ASIAA in Taiwan and KASI in Korea is available as risk-shared.

3. Deadlines:
Semester 2018A (Regular, Large, Short, GTO and Back-up Program* Proposals): 
- September 1, 2018, 15:00 JST [06:00 UT]
* Available for researchers affiliated with Japanese institutes
Semester 2018B (Regular, Short, GTO and Joint Proposals with ASTE (if ASTE is open for the 2019 observing season)): 
- December 1, 2018, 15:00 JST [06:00 UT]

DDT proposals can be submitted anytime after the first deadline (September 1, 2018).

4. Submission:
We accept the proposal only via the web submission form. A LaTex
template must be used to generate the PDF file that contains the
Scientific and Technical Justifications.  The device setting table should be submitted in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet 
by using its template.  Please access the application
form, fill the webform and upload the final PDF file and the Excel spreadsheet.

- The scientific and technical justification, including figures,
tables and references, must fit within 3 pages (4 pages for the Large and Joint
Proposals). The maximum file size is 20 MB.
- Please attach (cut&paste) the results of our time estimators to the the scientific and technical justification 
(this part will not be counted for the page limit, but the overall data size should meet the size limit).
http://www.nro.nao.ac.jp/~nro45mrt/html/prop/wsub-help.html
- The device setting table as a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet.

5. Evaluation:
- Proposals in the category of Regular, Large, GTO and Joint proposals are
evaluated by referees, and the acceptance is judged by the millimeter
and submillimeter time allocation committee.
- Proposals in the categories of Short and Back-up programs are
evaluated and judged by the millimeter and submillimeter time
allocation committee.

6. Time allocation:
45-m Observational time will be allocated by the
Nobeyama Radio observatories for proposals accepted by the
millimeter and submillimeter time allocation committee.

7. There is a risk that this Call for Proposals can be the last call for the open use of the 45-m telescope of Nobeyama Radio Observatory, depending on the budgetary condition of the observatory.

8. Questions?
Any questions about observations and preparations of proposals should
be submitted through the helpdesk:
https://www.nro.nao.ac.jp/~nro45mrt/html/helpdesk/inquiry_form.html
