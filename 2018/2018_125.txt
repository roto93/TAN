Dear Yi-Jehng,

The SMA call for proposal (standard science projects, 2018B semester) =
has just ben announced.=20
The deadline for submission is Sep.7 (Fri.), 4 a.m. in Taiwan time.
I would appreciate it if you could circulate this CfP to TAN.

Regards,
Naomi

> Dear Colleague,

> We wish to draw your attention to the currrently open call for =
proposals for observations with the Submillimeter Array (SMA), the =
reconfigurable interferometric array of eight 6-m antennas on Mauna Kea =
jointly built and operated by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory =
and the Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics. The =
array operates in the 230 GHz, 345 GHz and 400 GHz bands.=20
>=20
> The SMA is currently accepting proposals for the 2018B observing =
semester (16 Nov, 2018 - 15 May, 2019) from principal investigators from =
the worldwide astronomical community.=20

> As previously announced, the proposal deadline is:

> The SMA has recently completed significant upgrades in observational =
capability, with more under way. Currently, the SMA observes =
simultaneously with two orthogonally polarized receivers, one in the 230 =
GHz or 345 GHz band and the other in the 240 GHz or 400 GHz band, with =
full polarimetric observations available using the 230+240 or 345+400 =
band combinations. The SWARM correlator processes 8 GHz bandwidth for =
each receiver in each sideband, for a total of 32 GHz, at a uniform 140 =
kHz resolution. This 32 GHz frequency coverage can be continuous where =
the tuning ranges overlap for the two orthogonally polarized receivers. =
In short, the SMA now provides flexible, wide band frequency coverage =
that delivers high continuum sensitivity and excellent spectral line =
capabilities. A full track offers continuum sensitivity of 200 or 500 =
micro-Jy (1 sigma) at 230 or 345 GHz in good weather conditions =
(precipitable water vapor 2.5mm and 1.0mm, respectively). The =
corresponding line sensitivities at 1 km/s resolution are 30 and 70 mJy. =
The small antennas allow access to low spatial frequencies in the =
sub-compact configuration, and at the other extreme, the finest angular =
resolution with the very extended configuration at 345 GHz is ~ 0.25". =
The compact and extended configurations complete the range. Thus, in =
some ways, the characteristics and performance of the SMA are both =
similar and complementary to those of the stand-alone Atacama Compact =
Array (ACA) component of ALMA.=20
