Dear Yi-Jehng,

I would appreciate it if you could circulate the CfP of the TRAO 14m =
telescope
to TAN.

Thank you,
Naomi

Call for Proposal (2018-2019 term)

=20
We would like to call for proposals using TRAO (Taeduk Radio Astronomy =
Observatory) 14m telescope for the term of 2018 autumn to 2019 spring. =
Recently we successfully installed a multi-beam receiver system, =
SEQUOIA-TRAO, and renovated most part of the telescope system. The new =
receiver system is now equipped with high-performing 16-pixel MMIC =
preamplifiers in a 4x4 array, operating within 85-115.6 GHz frequency =
range. System temperature ranges from 170 K (86~110 GHz) to 400 K (115 =
GHz; 12CO). The 2nd IF modules with the narrow band and the 8 channels =
with 4 FFT spectrometers allow to observe 2 frequencies simultaneously =
within the 85~100 or 100~115 GHz bands for all 16 pixels of the =
receiver. OTF (On-The-Fly) mapping mode is the main observing mode, and =
a simple position switching mode is also available. OTF test observation =
shows that it takes 27 min for 6=E2=80=99x6=E2=80=99 region, and 37 min =
for 10=E2=80=99x10=E2=80=99. You may decide a regrid size and =
convolution parameter after completion of your observation. Pointing =
accuracy is about 6 acrsec. The backend system (FFT spectrometer) =
provides the 4096x2 channels with a fine velocity resolution of better =
than 0.05 km/s (15 kHz) per channel. Its effective spectra bandwidth is =
60 MHz.

There are three Key Science Programs (KSP) =
<http://radio.kasi.re.kr/trao/schedule.php> running for three years, =
abstracts of which are accessible at the TRAO home page.  Proposals =
which are not overlapped with KSPs are encouraged. Please refer the TRAO =
homepage for KSPs and other information. There are lots of telescope =
time avaliable between LST 10 and 15hrs, thus proposals using this time =
slots would have more privilege. Scientists, who did not have an =
observing experience at TRAO, are encouraged to have an internal =
collaborator(s) of KASI (Korea Astronomy and Space Science). The upper =
limit of telescope time per proposal is suggested as 100 hours. Two =
bedrooms and kitchen are available for outside observers. Deadline for =
proposal submission is August 31st 2018 (KST 23:59; UT+9). =20
