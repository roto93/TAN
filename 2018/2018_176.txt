Dear Tennet/Ryunet subscribers,

The Chile Observatory of the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ) solicits observing proposals for the Atacama Submillimeter Telescope Experiment (ASTE) telescope for the period June 1st to September 30th, 2019.   A total of ~200 hours is available in the LST range of 13 - 3 hours.

Note that the time available for this call for proposals is significantly reduced. This is because the projects which had lost time due to weather/instrumental problems during the 2017/2018 season are being carried over to 2019.

The deadline is December 4, 2018 (9:00 JST).

Please see

for further information.

Director, Chile Observatory, NAOJ
Seiichi Sakamoto
