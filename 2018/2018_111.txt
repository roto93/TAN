dear all,
I've prepared a page to advertize the science verification period for Spirou:
http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/Instruments/SPIRou/SPIRou_sv.php
It includes a call for the community to propose short observing programs.
Please spread the word, so that we get a nice collection of diverse
science results out of this period.
cheers
Claire
