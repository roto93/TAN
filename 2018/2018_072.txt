Speaker:    Jonathan Marshall (ASIAA)
Topic:         Debris dust as a tracer of planetary system architectures
Time:         5/23 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
Debris discs are tenuous rings of rock and ice around main sequence stars left over from planet formation processes. Their presence, most commonly inferred through the detection of excess emission at infrared wavelengths, is a signpost for the presence of a planetary system around the host star. At millimetre wavelengths, the dust emission is believed to closely trace the unseen belt of dust-producing planetesimals (asteroids and comets). Resolved imaging of debris discs at millimetre wavelengths reveals structures, e.g. azimuthal asymmetries, that can be linked to perturbation of the planetesimal belt by an unseen companion. Here I will present modelling of a sample of debris discs that have been observed at infrared and millimetre wavelengths in order to reveal the size scales of these systems as a function of the host stars' luminosities, and then used that as a ruler to interpret the emission from unresolved systems in order to identify potentially perturbed systems.

Dear all,

We will have TTTT seminar at NTHU on 24 May given by

Title: Near-infrared survey in the GOODS-north field and the
scientific applicationin the study of AGN host-galaxy properties

Speaker: Dr. Li-Ting Hsu (å¾ éº—å©·)

Time: 12:20-13:00pm 24th May (Thursday)

Venue: R501, IoA, 5th floor in the 2nd General Building

Abstract: To understand the evolution of AGNs and galaxies,
near-infrared (NIR) imaging is essential because: (1) NIR can
used to identify Balmer break of galaxies at 1<z<4, (2) NIR
luminosity reflects the stellar mass of galaxies, and (3) NIR is
less affected by the dust extinction comparing to optical
observation. In this talk, I will present the result of our deep NIR
images (J, H, and Ks) in the extended Great Observatories Origins
Deep Survey-North (GOODS-N) field using the instrument
CFHT/WIRCAM. The data reaches 5-sigma limiting AB magnitudes
(in 2â€  aperture) of J=24.6 mag, H=23.8 mag, and Ks=24.1 mag
over ~0.25 deg^2 .Â In addition to the NIR images, I will present the
results of the photometric redshifts (photo-z) using the
multi-wavelength photometry collected from UV to IR. Based on
this results, I will also talk about our ongoing science, which is the
study of the connection between AGNs and their host-galaxy
properties. We make two corrections to get more accurate
emission from the AGN host galaxies by dust de-reddening and
subtracting the AGN contribution via SED decomposition.
I will show our preliminary results in the talk.

With best regards,
Tetsuya Hashimoto
