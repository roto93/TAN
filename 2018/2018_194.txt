Title: SOKENDAI-UST Asia Winter School (SAWS) 2019
      Star and Planet Formation: Key Questions and Challenges

Web site: https://guas-astronomy.jp/eng/Applicants/winter2018.html =
<https://guas-astronomy.jp/eng/Applicants/winter2018.html>

Date: February 27 to March 1, 2019
     - Lecture; 1.5 days
     - Group discussion; 0.5 days in daytime (+ extra nighttime)
     - Presentation; 0.5 days

Venue: Headquarters of the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan,
      Mitaka, Tokyo, Japan (https://www.nao.ac.jp/en/access/mitaka/ =
<https://www.nao.ac.jp/en/access/mitaka/>)

Official language: English

Scientific Rationale:
 The research on star and planet formation has been growing very
rapidly via ground-based and space-based programs in opt/IR and
millimeter/submillimeter wavelengths and also via theoretical works.
Furthermore, the research will be moving to a new era in the next
decade with new telescopes, larger opt/IR telescopes such as TMT,
and space telescopes such as JWST.
 This SAWS2019 provides opportunities to students from EA countries
to stay at Mitaka in NAOJ and experiences to hear a series of lectures
and discuss on key questions, which are still unresolved and really
essentials to unveil the mystery of star and planet formation.
 NAOJ is a central astronomical observatory in Japan and also a partner
East Asia Core Observatory (EAO). NAOJ is operating the SUBARU telescope =
in Hawaii, joining international projects such as ALMA and East-Asian
VLBI Network operation, and TMT construction. NAOJ is also engaged in
fostering doctoral researchers in astronomy and planetary science as
a part of SOKENDAI.

Candidate Lecturers and topics:
 - Observations of forming planets; Jun Hashimoto (ABC/NAOJ)
 - Theory of planet formation: Eiichiro Kokubo (NAOJ/SOKENDAI),
   Yasunori Hori (ABC/NAOJ)
 - Brown dwarf, IMF/CMF: Motohide Tamura (Univ. Tokyo/ABC/NAOJ)
 - First core: Kengo Tomida (Osaka Univ.)
 - Low-mass star-formation, outflow/jet: Naomi Hirano (ASIAA)
 - Dust and polarization: Akimasa Kataoka (NAOJ/SOKENDAI)
 - High-mass star-formation: Kee-Tae Kim (KASI/UST)
 - First stars and metal/dust production in the Era of Reionization:
   Akio Inoue (Osaka Sangyo Univ.)
 - Astrochemistry and astrobiology: Hideko Nomura (Tokyo Inst. Tech.)
 - Future projects: Masao Saito (NAOJ/SOKENDAI), Paul T. P. Ho (EAO)

Format:
 - Lecturers will review each topic and give key questions.
   Key scientific papers will be provided to students.
 - Students will be divided into small groups to discuss each key
   question based on the papers, under supervision by lecturers
   and additional tutors.
 - We would like to ask lecturers to help discussion if they
   are available. We will also ask local staff to help as tutors.
 - The results of discussion will be presented in the last session.

Call for applicants:
 About 40-50 will be accepted mainly from the MS/PhD students studying
in mainly East Asian region, and travel and hotel expenses are supported
(or offered) for students selected by SOC from SOKENDAI or UST.

____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:        Li-Ching Huang (NCU)
Topic:          Flare Activities of Eclipsing Binary Systems in Kepler Field
Time:           11/26 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:           R1203


*** Special Seminar ***
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:        Daniel Harsono (Leiden Observatory)
Topic:          Testing disk formation against observations
Time:           11/27 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Protoplanetary disk population shows a large diversity of physical structure. This diversity could be driven by the different initial conditions of disk formation. While Keplerian disks are typically found in older embedded protostellar systems, it is still unclear when and how they form. ALMA has started to open a window to study these disks in detail. I will present studies that unravel the physical conditions of these young disks and methods to test disk formation models.

Dear colleagues,

Here is a reminder. Deadline for abstracts is in about a week.

> Exploring the Infrared Universe: The Promise of SPICA
> Crete, Greece
> 20-23 May 2019
> http://www.spica2019.org/
> Deadline for abstracts: 2018 December 1
> 
>  
> We now invite the community to submit abstracts for contributed talks and posters for the conference "Exploring the Infrared Universe: The Promise of SPICA". We welcome contributions with clear connections to SPICA, and are very interested in contributions that can help to finalize the design of SPICA,  and to strengthen or augment the SPICA science case.
>  
>  
> Science rationale:
>  
> The infrared wavelength range is key to understand the origin and evolution of galaxies, stars and planetary systems, which are obscured by dust during a large part of their life cycles. With a large cold mirror and a sensitive suite of instruments, SPICA, recently selected as a candidate for ESAâ€™s Cosmic Visions program, stands poised to revolutionize these fields by providing ultra-deep spectroscopy in the 12-230 Âµm range, as well as imaging (17-37 Âµm and 100-350 Âµm) and polarimetry (100-350 Âµm). With launch planned for 2030, SPICA will provide a huge leap in capabilities over previous infrared space missions, and complement current and upcoming facilities, filling the spectral gap between JWST and ALMA. We would like to invite the international astronomical community to participate in the conference, Exploring the Infrared Universe: The Promise of SPICA, which will take place on the island of Crete on 20-23 May 2019.  At this conference, participants will learn ab!
 out the capabilities and current design of SPICA, which includes a significant Guest Observer program, while discussing the exciting scientific promise of the mission. Up to date information about the SPICA mission and its instruments can be found at http://www.spica-mission.org, in addition to links to a set of whitepapers recently published in the journal PASA, that focus on some of the science enabled by SPICA.
