Dear TW-ASTRO  Colleagues

Please take note of a colloquium event at the Institute of Physics, Academia Sin
ica, 
this Thurs. Nov 15 ,  2PM at the 1F Lecture Hall.

Dr. Haino will tell us about  both the AMS experiment at the Space Station (in w
hich IoP & Taiwan
has made major contributions in the past ~20 years)   and the KAGRA experiment i
n Japan 
(on an exciting and emerging subject of gravitational wave detection,  in which 
IoP is involved
with increasing intensity).

Refreshment will be served after the event.

It would be an illuminating lecture.  Please mark your calendar and join.

Best Regards
Henry Wong.

Academia Sinica Institute of Physics  ---   Colloquium Notice

Time/Venue : 2018/11/15(Thu)     14:00 -16:00    1st Floor(auditorium) 

Title     Exploring the Early Universe with Particles and Gravitational Waves
Speaker    Prof. Sadakazu Haino       ;   Institute of Physics, Academia Sinica.

Abstract

Since the detection of cosmic rays in 1912, major developments in particle physi
cs had been led by many discoveries of new particles in cosmic rays and even aft
er accelerators took over the frontiers, cosmic rays still remain to be an impor
tant field in particle physics and cosmology. Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) 
has revolutionized the measurement precision by 1 order of magnitude improvement
 and is charting new territory since the installation on the International Space
 Station in 2011.
 Recently, Gravitational Waves (GW) have been directly discovered 1 century afte
r the prediction by Einstein and they are expected to open a new window to explo
re the early Universe and test the General Relativity at extreme conditions. Lar
ge Cryogenic Gravitational-wave Telescope, also known as KAGRA is a Asian-based 
project to join the world wide GW detector network in the coming years.
 In my talk, I will introduce recent results and next steps of AMS, and current 
status and future prospects of KAGRA.
