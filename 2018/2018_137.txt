Dear Li-Hwai,

Is there a way to distribute this notice broadly to the astronomy community in Taiwan? If so, could you do so? I don't have such capability.

Thanks,

John

Dear colleagues,

Registration is now open for the conference "Extremely Big Eyes on the Early Universe," to be held at the Kavli Institute for the Physics and Mathematics of the Universe (Kavli IPMU), March 25 - 29, 2019. This will be the second installment of a three part conference series:
University of California, Los Angeles, USA, January 28 - February 1, 2019
Institute for the Physics and Mathematics of the Universe, Tokyo, Japan, March 25-29, 2019
Accademia dei Lincei, Rome, Italy, September 9-13, 2019
Scientific Rationale:

In the next decade, the commissioning of Extremely Large Telescopes (20-40m class) will allow us to see the high redshift universe using new eyes of unprecedented power. By themselves or in combination with other facilities, these new eyes will have the potential to transform our understanding of the formation and early evolution of galaxies and black holes, first light and cosmic reionization, as well as the evolution of the intergalactic and circumgalactic media.

The Big Eyes conferences will bring together an international group of experts to review the current state of the art in the study of the high redshift universe and discuss how best to use giant telescopes to learn about it. Specifically, we aim to address the following questions:
What potentially transformative observations will be enabled by giant telescopes? What capabilities are required?
What are the key synergies between giant telescopes and other facilities? What are the areas and topics where a concerted effort will yield far superior results than the sum of all parts?
What theoretical or observational work is needed in preparation for first light? What are the limitations in our understanding that need to be overcome?
What calculations are required in order to make testable predictions and interpret the results of future astronomical observations?
It is extremely important to consider these questions now, while the plans for giant telescopes can still be influenced, and there is still sufficient time to carry out preparatory theoretical and observational work that will be needed to make the most of the large investments in these facilities. In order to facilitate attendance and reduce travel costs, we will hold three coordinated conferences, one each in America, Asia, and Europe.
