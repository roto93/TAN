*** ASIAA/NTU Joint Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Atsushi Taruya (YITP, Kyoto University)
Topic:         Relativistic effects on observed large-scale structure of the Universe
Time:         6/19 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         CCMS R104
Abstract:
The large-scale structure of the Universe observed via galaxy redshift surveys contains valuable cosmological information, and it has been playing a major role to improve our understanding of the Universe. However, ​the observed large-scale structure ​​appears distorted due to the observed ​​systematics in ​​the redshift determination, known as redshift-space distortions (RSD). Recently, the measurement of RSD is renewed with great interest as a probe of gravity on cosmological scales. In this talk, after reviewing the 'standard' RSD caused by the peculiar velocity of galaxies, I w​ill ​discuss yet another distortion arising from general relativistic effects. ​U​​nique feature of the​​ n​ew ​distortion e​ffects ​is demonstrated b​​​​ased on the simulated catalog taking a​ proper ​account of the relativistic effects,​ ​and detectability and implications to cosmology will be also discussed.

Topic:         Nonlinear structure formation in cold dark matter cosmology:  shell crossing and multi-stream flows
Time:         6/20 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
Invisible matter component called cold dark matter (CDM) is now widely accepted in cosmology as an essential building block of the cosmic structure formation. One important feature of CDM is that the phase-space velocity distribution was virtually null at very early time. This leads to, at later time, several interesting phenomena in nonlinear stage of gravitational dynamics: shell-crossing and multi-stream flow. In this talk, I will focus on these two phenomena, and discuss a way to describe quantitatively their phase-space structures, which is compared with state-of-the-art Vlasov-Poisson and cosmological N-body simulations.
