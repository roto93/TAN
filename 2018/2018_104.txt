**Exploring the Infrared Universe: The Promise of SPICA**
Crete, Greece

20-23 May 2019


The infrared wavelength range is key to understand the origin and
evolution of galaxies, stars and planetary systems, which are obscured
by dust during a large part of their life cycles. With a large cold
mirror and a sensitive suite of instruments, SPICA, recently selected as
a candidate for ESA=E2=80=99s Cosmic Visions program, stands poised to
revolutionize these fields by providing ultra-deep spectroscopy in the
12-230 =C2=B5m range, as well as imaging (17-37 =C2=B5m and 100-350 =C2=B5m= )
and polarimetry (100-350 =C2=B5m). With launch planned for 2030, SPICA will
complement current and upcoming facilities, filling the spectral gap
between JWST and ALMA, while providing a huge leap over previous
infrared space missions. We would like to invite the international
astronomical community to participate in the conference, **Exploring the
Infrared Universe: The Promise of SPICA**, which will take place on the
island of Crete on 20-23 May 2019.  At this conference, participants
will learn about the capabilities and current design of SPICA, which
includes a significant Guest Observer program, while discussing the
exciting scientific promise of the mission. Up to date information about
the SPICA mission and its instruments can be found at
http://www.spica-mission.org, in addition to links to a set of
whitepapers recently published in the journal PASA, that focus on some
of extragalactic science enabled by SPICA.=20


Topics to be addressed at the meeting include:

-The rise of metals and dust across cosmic time
-Feedback and feeding processes in galaxy evolution
-Star formation and the baryon cycle in galaxies
-Magnetic fields and turbulence in star formation
-Protoplanetary disks and the formation of habitable planets
-Debris disks, planetary systems, and the Solar system


Confirmed invited speakers include: Susanne Aalto, Yuri Aikawa,
Fran=C3=A7oise Combes, Bill Dent, Edith Falgarone, Davide Fedele, Andrea
Ferrara, Javier Goicoechea, Masateru Ishiguro, Patrick Koch, Leon
Koopmans, Ilse de Looze, Roberto Maiolino, Thomas M=C3=BCller, Tohru Nagao,
Klaus Pontoppidan, Alexandra Pope, and Peter Roelfsema.=20
