***************************************************************************
Registration now open at https://lsst-asia.org
Abstract submission deadline 17th December 2018
LSST@Asia: Exploring the Wide, Fast, Deep Universe
Sydney, Australia
May 20-23, 2019
***************************************************************************

Registration is now open for the LSST@Asia: Exploring the Wide, Fast,
Deep Universe conference (https://lsst-asia.org) to be held in Sydney,
Australia, 20-23 May 2019.

LSST@Asia is the first conference in what we intend to be a series,
following on from the series of very successful LSST@Europe
conferences held in 2013, 2016 and 2018. These meetings encouraged
close interaction between LSST personnel and European scientists
interested in LSST.

LSST@Asia will bring together scientists in Asia, Australia and South
Africa with an interest in the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope and
provide them with the opportunity to interact with each other as well
as with leaders of the LSST Science Collaborations and hear updates on
LSST construction and data processing progress.

The main objectives of the 2019 meeting are to:

    -Provide an update on the status of the LSST Project
    -Strengthen the network of scientists in Asia involved in various
aspects of LSST
    -Promote increased engagement of scientists with the LSST Science
Collaborations
    -Explore synergies with future astronomical facilities

Child care will be provided to maximise participation by those with
carer responsibilities. There will also be some funding support
available to encourage attendance by early-career researchers (<5
years post PHD) and PhD students.

Key Dates:
    Abstract submission now open
    December 17th 2018: Abstract submission closes
    February 4th 2019: Program announced
    March 4th 2019: Registration and conference fee payment deadline

*** Special Seminar ***
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Ryohei Kawabe (NAOJ)
Topic:         New 50m- class Large Submillimeter Telescope (LST) project
Time:         12/3 (Monday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
We introduce the LST project (1, 2) and its key sciences together with the recent discussions in two workshops for the Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST) project (3) held in Europe.  The LST is optimized for wide-area imaging and spectroscopic surveys in the 70-420 GHz frequency range, which spans the main atmospherics at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths for good observing sites such as the ALMA plateau in Chile. We also target observations at higher frequencies up to roughly 1 THz, using an inner high-precision surface. One of the key sciences is CO/[CII] (possibly + [OIII]) tomography, i.e., blind line emitter search, using the imaging spectrograph. With the tomography we aim at addressing key questions in galaxy formation and evolution such as finding first generation galaxies and investigating cosmic star formation history up to the EoR, e.g., z~10. The LST will also contribute to research on wide range of topics in astronomy and astrophysics!
, e.g., astrochemistry, star formation in our Galaxies and galaxies, the evolution of cluster of galaxies via SZE effect, and submillimeter VLBI observations of e.g., SMBHs. Via the discussions in the AtLAST workshops, the LST and AtLAST working groups tentatively concluded or agreed on that two similar projects,  i.e., LST and AtLAST, should be merged, and a killer science of the (~ 50m class) common single-dish telescope is the 3D exploration of the universe at mm/submm wavelengths. Our recent R&D activities for the LST and discussions on the LST for the Master Plan 2020 led by Science Council of Japan (SCJ) will be also reported briefly.

Topic:         CARTA development and live demo
Time:         12/3 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
On behalf of the CARTA team, I will introduce the CARTA (Cube Analysis and Rendering Tool for Astronomy) project. CARTA will serve as the next generation image viewer for the CASA package. In this informal talk, I will briefly report the development progress, then introduce the features we have implemented with a live demo.

Speaker:    Laurent Pagani (Observatoire de Paris)
Topic:         The COMplexity of Orion: An ALMA view
Time:         12/4 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
Orion KL is the closest (400 pc) of all the massive star forming regions 
and allows therefore detailed studies. Despite its closeness, its 
complexity still calls for interferometric observations in order to 
separate the different subregions emitting at different velocities, 
which are otherwise mixed in an inextricable combination of different 
species at similar apparent frequencies in single dish observations. 
Orion KL has another peculiarity : it has undergone an explosive event 
500 years ago as revealed by H2 and CO maps, and also by the proper 
motion of three stellar objects, BN, I and n.

While our ALMA observations were mostly aimed at detecting the rare 
isotopologue 16O18O to follow up on our Herschel detection of O2 towards 
this region (Goldsmith et al. 2011, Chen et al. 2014), we took the 
advantage of that deep search to observe 16 GHz of spectral band in the 
1.3 mm window. We did not detect 16O18O but the quality of our data (a 
5-fold improvement compared to the similar data taken during Science 
Verification 0) allowed us to identify a few species not detected yet in 
Orion, and study the kinematics of the region in detail. In particular, 
we report gGgâ€™ ethylene glycol and acetic acid detections in a peculiar 
place, and we explain the line position and shape of each subregion, 
both in relation with the 500 years-old explosion. We show that based on 
this kinematics, we can make a 3D description of the region.

The data quality is high enough to also study each species channel-wise. 
This reveals gas expansions never seen before which are traceable back 
to the explosion center. These expansions are comparable to 
time-of-flight experiments in the laboratory and allow therefore to 
establish the order of evolution between species, from those that are 
destroyed soon after their sublimation from the ices to those which 
survive until they get too diluted to be observed. This brings 
interesting clues to the chemistry of hot regions, and in particular of 
complex organic molecules (COMs). For example, we think that a route 
exists to produce ethyl cyanide in the gas phase (as also advocated by 
Suzuki et al. 2018).
