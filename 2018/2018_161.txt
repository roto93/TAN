> Over the course of the last several months an issue in CASA mosaic =
imaging was recognized.  The Observatory elected to understand and =
characterize the issue before informing the user community of potential =
impacts on the resulting images.  The CASA team has now identified a =
couple of issues using both the 7-m and 12-m arrays over the course of =
the past few cycles and CASA releases.  The full extent of the data =
affected is still being investigated.
>=20
> The two issues identified by the team with mosaic imaging are:
>=20
> 1.     Mosaicking observations with the 7-m array in Cycles 1-4 (range =
of CASA versions) were all affected.  The Observatory will reimage the =
maps in the archive for those projects and we will inform users of the =
timeline of that campaign.  The impact of this error is the fluxes are =
overestimated by ~10% throughout the map.  This specific issue was =
resolved in Cycle 5 (CASA version 5.1.1) and beyond.
>=20
> 2.     A different and more complex issue arose in the Cycle 5 =
software (CASA version 5.1.1 to 5.3, all versions), which affects all =
mosaics in Cycle 5.  While there are a variety of factors that =
contribute to the range of impacts, the most important parameter is the =
aspect ratio of the mosaic pointing distribution, i.e., the width/length =
ratio of the pointing centers (not the image size).  For projects with =
aspect ratios <1.5, the impact on fluxes throughout the bulk of the map =
is small, with large deviations in flux (>5%) largely confined to the =
edges of the map where the mosaic .pb file reaches values of <0.5.  If =
your science does not depend sensitively on fluxes measured at the edges =
of the mosaic and your aspect ratio is <1.5 the impact is negligible.  =
If your aspect ratio is >=3D1.5, fluxes in the bulk of the map can be =
affected.  This issue has been resolved in the Cycle 6 Pipeline (CASA =
version 5.4.0 or beyond).  The Observatory will determine the aspect =
ratios over the coming weeks and contact PIs regarding corrective action =
timelines.
>=20
>=20
> The Observatory regrets any inconvenience experienced by our ALMA =
users due to these issues. It is recommended that mosaic images are =
regenerated using the latest CASA release, CASA 5.4 (available at =
https://casa.nrao.edu/).  In addition, the Observatory will contact PIs =
further when aspect ratios are determined and follow up actions (e.g. =
QA3) are ready.  The actions that the Observatory is undertaking =
include:
>=20
> 1)    While we determine aspect ratios, all MOUSs with mosaic =
observations will have their proprietary periods paused.
>=20
> 2)    Once aspect ratios are determined, all project MOUSs still in =
proprietary period subject to issue 1, generically, or issue 2, for =
aspect ratios greater or equal to 1.5, will have their proprietary time =
paused retroactively to July 2018.  Projects subject to issue 2 with =
smaller aspect ratios will have proprietary period paused while it is =
determined if the PI needs to recover fluxes in the outer regions of the =
map with high accuracy.  The proprietary time will be extended by the =
amount from July 2018 until the new data products are available to the =
PI.

Observatory, please contact your local ARC for Support through the ALMA =
