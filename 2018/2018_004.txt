Topic:         New constraints on the black hole spin in radio-loud quasars
Time:         1/17 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
One of the major unsolved questions on the understanding of the AGN population is the origin of the dichotomy between radio-quiet and radio-loud quasars. The most promising explanation is provided by the spin paradigm, which suggests radio-loud quasars to have higher black hole spin. However, the measurement of black hole spin remains extremely challenging.
We here present results comparing the mean radiative efficiencies of carefully matched samples of radio-loud and radio-quiet SDSS quasars at 0.3<z<0.8. We find evidence for systematically larger radiative efficiencies by a factor > 1.5 in the radio-loud sample, suggesting that the radio-loud quasar population has on average higher black hole spin that the radio-quiet population. This provides observational support for the black hole spin paradigm.

Topic:         Origins of (sub)millimeter disk polarization
Time:         1/18 (Thursday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
Polarized (sub)millimeter emission from dust grains has long been established as a reliable way to probe magnetic fields in molecular clouds, based on the magnetic alignment of dust grains. At the same time, from theoretical studies, magnetic field is very important in the star formation and the evolution of protoplanetary disks, through either magnetorotational instability or magnetic-driven winds. The application of this method to the first resolved polarization observation in the protoplanetary disk HL Tau, however, yields rather unphysical magnetic field configuration and thus fails badly. This leaves an outstanding question: what are the origins of (sub)millimeter disk polarization? I will discuss the favored alternative mechanism, the “self-scattering” of dust grains, which successfully explains a lot of ALMA polarization observations to date. This brings both good news and bad news to the community. On the dark side, it’s harder to probe magnetic field with (sub!
)millimeter disk polarization, although we still found suggestive evidence in the IRAS 4A1 disk at long wavelength. On the bright side, polarization coming from “self-scattering” strongly depends on the properties of dust grains, including grain sizes, the optical depth, and thickness of dust disks. These allow us to study many important things, such as grain growth and dust settling.
