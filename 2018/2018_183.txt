Topic:          Mergers in MaNGA: Visual Classification of Merging Sequence and Preliminary Results of Spatially-Resolved SFR of Mergers
Time:           11/12 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Among the ~4700 MaNGA galaxies, we identified ~1300 potential galaxy pairs and mergers based on their spectroscopic companions or morphologies. We have devised scheme for classifying the stage of an interaction based on the morphological appearance of the system. The effect of interactions on SFR is quantified by computing the global and spatially-resolved SFR relative to the control galaxies and spaxels. The preliminary results show that although the global SFR enhancement increases with merging sequence, there is considerable variation in the radial profile of local SFR enhancement across the stages.



*** Colloquium ***

Topic:          Dust dynamics in protoplanetary disks
Time:           11/14 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Planet formation takes place inside disks of gas and dust around young stars --- protoplanetary disks (PPDs). While the dust component only makes up about one per cent of the total disk mass, it underpins planet formation from both theoretical and observational perspectives. In this talk, I describe our recent work on dust dynamics in PPDs. I will present a simplified framework to model the complex dynamics of dust-gas interaction, by drawing on n analogy between dusty-gas and pure gas dynamics. I then demonstrate several applications of this new approach, including a new analytical understanding of the `streaming instability' for planetesimal formation; numerical simulations of dust-settling in turbulent PPDs; and the interaction between low mass protoplanets and dusty disks. Implications for planet formation and future work will be discussed.
