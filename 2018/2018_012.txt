Formation of substellar objects: theory and observations

ESAC May 21-23, 2018

Madrid, Spain

********************************************************


On behalf of Local and Scientific Organizing Committees, we are pleased 
to announce a three days workshop devoted to brown dwarfs and their 
formation mechanism/s. More than 20 years have passed since the 
discovery of the first confirmed substellar objects. However, there are 
still many problems concerning brown dwarf formation and evolution.

During the last years, a large number of works have been focused on 
explaining the origin of brown dwarfs. Thanks to Spitzer, Herschel and 
lately ALMA, there are now evidences of a star-like scenario to explain 
the formation of these substellar objects. However, there are still open 
questions, like the role of turbulence, and the efficiency of other 
mechanisms (e.g. photo-evaporation, disk fragmentation) to produce BDs. 
On the other hand, the study of young clusters is producing more and 
more spectroscopically confirmed substellar IMFs, which are fundamental 
to understand BD formation and evolution.

The scope of this workshop is to gather experts on BD formation, both 
theoreticians and observational astronomers, to discuss about the 
results of the last decade. We plan to compare the theoretical 
expectations with the results from observations to understand which 
questions have been answered, and which ones are still open. Moreover, 
experts from other fields, such as exoplanets and chemical modeling, are 
welcome since one of the goals is to study the phenomena from a 
comprehensive perspective and to produce new synergies and projects.  In 
addition, we will discuss about the advances that can be done in this 
field with the advent of new facilities like e.g. JWST or Euclid.

Speaker:    Yen-Ting Lin (ASIAA)
Topic:         cluster galaxy evolution from z=1 to 0.3: an Hyper Suprime-Cam view
Time:         1/29 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:         R1203


*** Colloquium ***

Speaker:    James Wurster (Exeter)
Topic:         ￼The effect of non-ideal magnetohydrodynamics on star formation
Time:         1/31 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
Until recently, numerical simulations of low-mass star formation have been unable to produce large discs around a forming protostar.  This contradicts observations.  With the inclusion of non-ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), large discs are now being formed in numerical simulations, indicating the necessity of non-ideal MHD.  If the inclusion of non-ideal MHD can self-consistently re-introduce discs, then what effect will it have on the formation of the protostar itself, or on large scales in star forming clusters? In this talk, I will first introduce the three non-ideal MHD processes: Ohmic resistivity, ambipolar diffusion, and the Hall effect.  I will then discuss their effects on disc formation, the formation and evolution of the first and second hydrostatic core, and (if time permits) on star cluster formation.



*** Special Seminar ***

Speaker:    Nanda Kumar (Universidade do Porto)
Topic:         High-mass star formation: new observational insights
Time:         2/1 (Thursday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
While the hunt for disks around high-mass stars continues in the ALMA era, other interesting predictions of high-mass star formation theories remain untested. Dense accretion flows leading to the formation of the highest mass stars can become Jeans unstable, producing a near-equal mass binary. This can explain the near-equal mass binarity well-known in field massive stars. I will show high-angular resolution observations (VLT and ALMA) of two such systems in formation. Young high-mass stars are also expected to be bloated, with radii up to 400Rsun, because of high internal entropy. I will present new infrared observations supporting this hypothesis. Finally, I will present a new systematic search and discovery of infrared variability in a large sample of young massive stars.
