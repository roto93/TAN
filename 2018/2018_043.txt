Dear colleagues,

We are pleased to announce the 2018 TIARA Summer School on Origins of =
the Solar System, from July 16-20 in Taipei, Taiwan. The school is =
co-organized by the Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and =
Astrophysics and the Center of Star and Planet Formation and the Niels =
Bohr International Academy at the University of Copenhagen. The school =
will cover topics ranging from star formation to the making of planetary =
materials. The lectures are designed for Masters and PhD students, but =
the school is open to participants at all levels. A limited number of =
lodging support may be available for graduate students.=20

Lecturers include:

Pablo Benitez-Llambay (UCPH)
Martin Bizzarro (UCPH)

*** Colloquium ***

Speaker:    Fernando Olguin (NTHU)
Topic:         Determining the physical properties of the massive YSO AFGL 2591
Time:         3/28 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
The distribution of matter around massive proto-stars tells us which are the physical processes dominating the formation of massive stars. These physical processes can in turn help us to determine whether massive stars are formed as an upscale version of their low-mass counterparts. We can limit the effects of some physical by studying massive young stellar objects (MYSOs) which are where the ionising nature of the radiation from the massive star has not started to change the circumstellar environment. One of the most observed MYSOs is AFGL 2591, which has similar properties to those found in other MYSOs (e.g. jets/outflows) and it is relatively isolated. In this presentation, I will show the latest results of our multi-wavelength dust continuum study of the density and temperature structure of this source and molecular line emission study of its envelope kinematics. In particular, I will show how our radiative transfer modelling explains resolved Herschel 70 micron data, an!
d evidence of rotation in the inner envelope as mapped by methyl cyanide emission.

Dear colleagues,=20

I would like to bring to your attention another PhD scholarship
available within National Science Center (Poland) project at Adam
Mickiewicz University. I would appreciate your help with forwarding the
message to potential candidates.=20

PHD SCHOLARSHIP WITHIN NATIONAL SCIENCE CENTER PROJECT

Applications are invited for a PhD student scholarship at the Institute
Astronomical Observatory, Faculty of Physics, Adam Mickiewicz
University, Pozna=C5=84, Poland. PhD student will work within the Nationa=
l
Science Center project "Inner Main Belt V-type asteroids as tracers of
differentiated planetesimals" under the supervision of Dr. Dagmara
Oszkiewicz and Prof. Tomasz Kwiatkowski. The main goal of the project is
investigation of formation and evolution of differentiated planetesimals
in the Solar System though a comprehensive study of V-type asteroids.=20

Participation in visitor mode in photometric and spectroscopic observing
campaigns, including extended stays at telescopes in Europe and USA is
expected. The scholarship of 3200 PLN/month (about 750 EUR/month after
tax) is planned for 3 years and starts in the mid of 2018.=20

A candidate for the scholarship should have a master degree in
astronomy, physics or computer science. Experience in photometric and
spectroscopic observations of asteroids, data reduction and knowledge of
programming language python will be an advantage, but is not required.=20

During the course of the project the candidate is expexted to complete
PhD studies.=20

Applications must include:
(1) CV with a list of eventual publications,
(2) letter describing research interests and previous experience,
(3) Master degree diploma including transcript of records
(4) two recommendation letters.=20

Applications should be submitted electronically as one PDF document by
March 31, 2018 via email to dagmara.oszkiewicz@amu.edu.pl . =20

For more information, please contact Dagmara Oszkiewicz.=20
