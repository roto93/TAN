> Dear all,
> 
> We will host a SMI/SPICA meeting on Oct. 4 at ASIAA. The website is now open for registration.

> The SPace Infrared telescope for Cosmology and Astrophysics (SPICA) mission is selected as one of ESAâ€™s fifth medium class mission in its Cosmic Vision science programme in May 2018. In SPICA, ASIAA partners with JAXA to develop the SPICA Mid-infrared Instrument (SMI) and the science program associate with it. It is important to regain our momentum on the science activities and technical development after the M5 phase A selection.
> 
> This workshop aims to provide the opportunities for Taiwanese astronomers to review the capability of the new SPICA, to present the science interests with SPICA and also to promote the future collaboration between Taiwanese and Japanese communities especially on SMI.
> 
> We think that the SPICA facility, with its instruments SMI, SAFARI and the (as-of-yet) unnamed polarisation instrument (previously known as SAFARI/POL but now it is separated from SAFARI), match your scientific and project interests. So we hope to have your participation.
> 
> Here I show you a list of references for more about SPICA and its instrumentation suite.
