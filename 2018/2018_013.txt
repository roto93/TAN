Dear all,

We will have TTTT seminar on 9 Feb. in NTHU, given by
Dr. Yuichi Higuchi, who is  a postdoc in Academia Sinica.

Title:
Probing supervoids with weak gravitational lensing

Speaker: Dr. Yuichi Higuchi

Time: 12:20pm 9th Feb. (Friday)

Venue: R501, IoA, 5th floor in the 2nd General Building

Abstract:

CMB experiments revealed that there are non-Gaussian features in the map.
An anomalous cold spot surrounded with a hot ring, called the Cold Spot is
one of such features. The temperature decrement becomes ~100 \muK across 
~10
degree on the skyplane (e.g.,Vielca et al., 2004). The anomaly can be 
explained
by the linear/non-linear integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect caused by a 
supervoid
with a radius of 200-300 Mpc/h in the local Universe. Recent photometric 
and
redshift observations showed the possibility of the existence of the 
supervoids,
while large errors such as galaxy bias and photo-z are included in the 
observations.
In order to investigate the properties of such voids with an un-biased 
method,
we propose to observe the region with weak gravitational lensing which 
can trace
baryon and dark matters on a line of sight.Through a ray-tracing 
simulation, we
investigated the prospects for detecting lensing signals from the 
supervoids and
for investigating the properties through weak gravitational lensing. We 
found that
the lensing signals can be detected at S/N>4 with on-going large weak 
lensing
surveys and we can obtain a constraint on the projected mass 
distribution of the
supervoids with these surveys.

With best regards,
Tetsuya
