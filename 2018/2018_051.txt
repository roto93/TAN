Topic:         Stellar Archaeology as a Time Machine to the First Stars
Time:         4/17 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
Understanding the nature of the first stars is a major challenge of modern cosmology. Despite their importance for the formation of subsequent stars and galaxies, their mass distribution is not well constrained due to a lack of direct observations. Extremely metal poor stars in the Milky Way allow to constrain the mass of their progenitor supernovae and thereby provide precious information about the first generation of stars ("Pop III"). I will present a new diagnostic to reliably distinguish mono-enriched from multi-enriched metal-poor stars, based on the individual and combined chemical yields of Pop III supernovae. Milky Way satellites are the most promising regions to find second generation stars that were enriched by only one previous supernovae. We apply our new diagnostic to recently observed stars from the TOPoS survey and I will show that our results help to optimise upcoming Galactic archaeology surveys to detect more of these precious stellar fossils, which allow !
to better constrain the mass function of the first stars.

*** Colloquium ***

Speaker:    Daniel Whalen (ICG)
Topic:         The Formation of the First Quasars in the Universe
Time:         4/18 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are found at the centers of most
massive galaxies today.  But over 120 quasars have now been discovered
at z > 6, including ULAS J1342, an 800 million solar mass BH at z =
7.5, and ULAS J1120, a two billion solar mass BH at z = 7.1.  We have
developed new radiation hydrodynamical simulations of SMBH evolution
in cosmological environments with the Enzo AMR cosmology code in which
X-rays from the BH are fully coupled to nonequilibrium primordial gas
chemistry and hydrodynamics.  These models include ionizing UV
radiation, winds and SNe due to star formation in the host galaxy, all
of which are known to regulate the growth of the BH and the rise of
the stellar populations themselves.  Our models reproduce for the
first time all the observed properties of J1120: BH mass, radius of
its H II region, and the star formation rate, metallicity and
dynamical mass of the central 1.5 kpc of its host galaxy.  I will
discuss these models as well as detection limits for the first quasars
in the NIR and 21 cm as a function of redshift in connection with
future AGN surveys at 5 < z < 15 by Euclid, JWST, the E-ELT and SKA.
