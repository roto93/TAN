Topic:        Extended dust emission from nearby Asymptotic Giant Branch stars
Time:        8/6 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:          R1203
Abstract:
Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars in the Milky Way are often overlooked due to difficulties in obtaining distances. Understanding their dust emission properties and mass-loss histories leads to better comprehension of the ISM evolution in the Milky Way, in particular its dust reservoir. Most studies have determined the stellar dust mass using mid-IR emission, but a historic cold dust reservoir from a previous mass-loss phase may remain undetected in the mid-IR, requiring observations at longer wavelengths.

We present results of a search for extended dust emission from a diverse sample of AGB stars within 1 kpc. This project is part of the Nearby Evolved Star Survey (NESS), which aims to determine gas and dust return from a volume limited sample of galactic evolved stars.

Observations at 450?μm? and 850?μm? were carried out using the SCUBA-2 instrument on the JCMT and combined with Herschel PACS observations at 70?μm? and 160?μm from the MESS survey (Groenewegen et al., 2011; Cox et al., 2012). Using azimuthally-averaged surface brightness profiles we determined extension and percentage flux of the extended component for each source at the four wavelengths. We derived extensions at the 3σ levels greater than ~40'' for majority of the sources at SCUBA-2 850?μm?. The fraction of the flux emitted from the extended region is ~40% at 850?μm? and ~50% at PACS wavelengths.

We report a clear detection of the detached shell of U Ant in both 450?μm? and 850?μm?. This is the first time this detached shell has been detected in the sub-mm continuum.

By fitting a modified black body to four-point SEDs at each radial point we derive the dust temperature, spectral index of emissivity, and column density to probe dust mass-loss history and detect changes in physical properties of dust as a function radius (hence, time). The resulting dust-to-gas ratios are consistent with canonicalvalues. The surface density profiles suggest deviation from constant mass loss in a majority of the sources.
