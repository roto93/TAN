Dear Yi-Jehng,

Here is the new version of the SMA Call for proposals.
Note that the deadline for the large-scale project has been changed to =
Feb. 14 (in Taiwan time).
I would appreciate it if you could circulate the new version to TAN.

Regards,
Naomi

> Dear Colleagues,
> The Large Scale Projects program for observations with the =
Submillimeter Array (SMA) <https://sma1.sma.hawaii.edu/> is now =
accepting Notices of Intent to propose. Under this program, proposals =
dedicated to answering major astrophysical questions having significant =
scientific impact requiring observing times of order 100 to 1,000 hours =
are solicited. In this communication, we are also pre-announcing the =
dates for standard observing proposals. These calls are for the 2019A =
semester with observing period 16 May to 15 November 2019.

> Notice of Intent: 10 January 2019

> The SMA is a reconfigurable interferometric array of eight 6-meter =
antennas on Maunakea jointly built and operated by the Smithsonian =
Astrophysical Observatory and the Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy =
and Astrophysics. The array operates in the 230, 345, and 400 GHz bands.
>=20
> The SMA has recently completed significant upgrades in observational =
capability, with more under way. Currently, the SMA observes =
simultaneously with two orthogonally polarized receivers, one in the 230 =
GHz or 345 GHz band and the other in the 240 GHz or 400 GHz band (with =
full polarimetric observations available using the 230+240 GHz or =
345+400 GHz combinations).
>=20
> The SWARM correlator processes 8 GHz bandwidth for each receiver in =
each sideband, for a total of 32 GHz, at a uniform 140 kHz resolution. =
This 32 GHz frequency coverage can be continuous where the tuning ranges =
overlap for the two orthogonally polarized receivers. In short, the SMA =
now provides flexible, wide band frequency coverage that delivers high =
continuum sensitivity and excellent spectral line capabilities (at 140 =
kHz spectral resolution).
>=20
> A full track offers continuum sensitivity of 200 or 600 micro-Jy (1 =
sigma) at 230 or 345 GHz in good weather conditions (precipitable water =
vapor 2.5 mm and 1.0 mm, respectively). The corresponding line =
sensitivities at 1 km/s resolution are 35 and 80 mJy. The small antennas =
allow access to low spatial frequencies in the subcompact configuration, =
and at the other extreme, the finest angular resolution with the very =
extended configuration at 345 GHz is ~0.25". The compact and extended =
configurations complete the range.
>=20
> Thus, in some ways, the characteristics and performance of the SMA are =
both similar and complementary to those of the standalone Atacama =
Compact Array component of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter =
Array. For more information about SMA capabilities, visit the SMA =
Observer Center website <http://sma1.sma.hawaii.edu/status.html> and =
explore the set of SMA proposing tools =
<http://sma1.sma.hawaii.edu/tools.html>. Current and archived SMA =
Newsletters <https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/sma/Newsletters/> available =
online provide a sampling of the wide variety of science possible with =
the SMA.
>=20
> The Large Scale Projects program follows a phased development, =
submission, and review path, with the final selection of successful =
proposals synchronized with the TAC process for regular proposals. =
Accordingly, a Notice of Intent =
<http://sma1.sma.hawaii.edu/legacysubmit.html> is required ahead of full =
submission.
>=20
> A second announcement will be circulated when the standard proposal =
system opens for submissions, expected on or before February 7 2019. For =
