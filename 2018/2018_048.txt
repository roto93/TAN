First Announcement
___________________

We would like to announce that the 8th east Asian numerical astrophysics meeting (EANAM8) will be held at Cheng-Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, from Oct. 22 to Oct. 26, 2018. Our web page: http://eanam8.gsroc.tw .

----------------
Aims and Scope:
----------------
Numerical simulations have become even more important as detailed comparisons between theories and observations are now possible at a deeper level in most fields of astrophysics. The aim of this series of meetings is to bring (but not limited to) East-Asian numerical astrophysicists together and provide chances to learn each other's work and explore possible collaborations among them. The scope of the meeting will encompass all major astronomical research fields that involve numerical simulations, including (but not limited to) cosmology, astronomical hydrodynamics, magnetohydrodynamics, radiative transfer, particle acceleration, and planetary / stellar / galactic dynamics. In addition, there will also be a focus on computer science applications directed toward astrophysics including numerical methods, simulation data analysis, high performance computing, and optimization for use on large scale computer clusters. Participants from outside of East Asia are warmly welcome as w!
ell.

The registration deadline is September 30th, 2018.
The abstract submission deadline is September 22nd, 2018.
