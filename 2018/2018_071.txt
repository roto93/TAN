Dear all,

We will have TTTT seminar at NTHU on 24 May given by
Dr. Li-Ting Hsu, who is a postdoc in Academia Sinica.

Title: Near-infrared survey in the GOODS-north field and the
scientific applicationin the study of AGN host-galaxy properties

Speaker: Dr. Li-Ting Hsu (å¾ éº—å©·)

Time: 12:20-13:00pm 24th May (Thursday)

Venue: R501, IoA, 5th floor in the 2nd General Building

Abstract: To understand the evolution of AGNs and galaxies,
near-infrared (NIR) imaging is essential because: (1) NIR can
used to identify Balmer break of galaxies at 1<z<4, (2) NIR
luminosity reflects the stellar mass of galaxies, and (3) NIR is
less affected by the dust extinction comparing to optical
observation. In this talk, I will present the result of our deep NIR
images (J, H, and Ks) in the extended Great Observatories Origins
Deep Survey-North (GOODS-N) field using the instrument
CFHT/WIRCAM. The data reaches 5-sigma limiting AB magnitudes
(in 2â€  aperture) of J=24.6 mag, H=23.8 mag, and Ks=24.1 mag
over ~0.25 deg^2 .Â In addition to the NIR images, I will present the
results of the photometric redshifts (photo-z) using the
multi-wavelength photometry collected from UV to IR. Based on
this results, I will also talk about our ongoing science, which is the
study of the connection between AGNs and their host-galaxy
properties. We make two corrections to get more accurate
emission from the AGN host galaxies by dust de-reddening and
subtracting the AGN contribution via SED decomposition.
I will show our preliminary results in the talk.

With best regards,
Tetsuya Hashimoto
