ASIAA lunch box talk at 12pm on Monday, Nov. 5th
will be given by Dr. Liu, Guo-Chin on the subject:

"Foreground Contamination of CMB polarization"

The content of the speech will be different from
the CosPa talk he gave several days ago. The
talk will be held in the conference room 716 at
our institute (ASIAA) which is located in the Physics
Department Building on the TaiDa campus.

If you want me to order a lunch box for you (not
free, it costs 65 NT dollors), please send me an
email by 10:30am on Nov. 5th.

See you then.
