Dear TANists, here is a good news to share with you.  Yi-Jehng

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prof. Sun Kwok, a leading expert in planetary nebulae and a subscriber
of TAN, has recently published a new book "Cosmic Butterflies" on PNe
and stellar evolution.  This is a popular science book full of thrilling,
pretty pictures of PNe and PPNe.  The style of the book may be similar 
to "Hubble Vision" yet with a systematic introduction on (proto)planetary
nebulae and the stellar evolution of intermediate-mass stars.  This book
provides enjoyable reading for everyone -- scientists or not.

"Cosmic Butterflies" is published by Cambridge University Press and is now
available from www.amazon.com or www.cup.org.
