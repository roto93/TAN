Subject: 2001 Gordon Conference on Origins of Solar Systems

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        2001 Gordon Research Conference on Origins of Solar Systems
                  June 17-22 (Sunday night -Thursday night),
		Connecticut College, New London CT, USA

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
First, an apology if you receive multiple copies of this message. But 
feel free to pass it on to students or recent people in the field who 
might not be on a (rather old) mailing list.

You are invited to attend the upcoming Gordon conference. It is our 
aim to make this meeting lively, interdisciplinary and topical, 
befitting the exciting nature of the field. You can contribute to the 
meeting's success by submitting a poster paper and participating in 
the lengthy discussion period following each invited talk. Requests 
to display poster papers are usually always met (with the proviso 
that nobody should submit several with the same author), and should 
be sent to the Vice-Chair, Pat Cassen at pcassen@mail.arc.nasa.gov.

An almost compete list of speakers was determined months ago (see end 
of this email) but discussion leaders are not yet determined. We 
chose these speakers guided by our desire to have new people (often 
young), include new developments, and to have a gender balance 
representative of the field. We cannot cover everything, but the 
meeting has a broad perspective. A full list of people and schedule 
for the meeting will be forthcoming soon. But remember that the 
purpose of the meeting is to benefit from it in its entirety, so the 
precise schedule of talks should not be relevant to your decision to 
attend.

Because attendance at Gordon Research Conferences is limited, you must
apply to the GRC office for permission to attend. This includes 
invited speakers. Once accepted, you will be mailed a registration 
packet, which must then be returned to the GRC office. You may find 
complete details about how to apply for the Origins of Solar Systems 
GRC in the February 23, 2001 issue
of Science, or by visiting the GRC web page at
http://www.grc.uri.edu/. Further details about the GRC may be found
there as well. In particular, you will find information about the 
Conference site, which is different from previous sites for this 
meeting. (The organizers had no say in this choice but it appears to 
be a nice place.)

The conference is sponsored by the Gordon Research Conference organization,
the Lunar and Planetary Institute, and the NASA Origins of Solar
Systems Research Program. A limited amount of funds will be available
for the support of deserving young scientists. Requests for travel
funds should be directed to the Chair, Dave Stevenson (djs@gps.caltech.edu),
along with a brief statement of justification.

We look forward to seeing all of you at Connecticut College.

Chair: David Stevenson (Div. Geological & Planetary Sci., 150-21, California
Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA 91125; djs@gps.caltech.edu)

Vice-Chair: Pat Cassen ( NASA Ames, MS 245-3, Moffett Field CA 94035 
pcassen@mail.arc.nasa.gov
