> Astronomers have a growing interest in applying advanced statistical
> techniques to the analysis of observational data. Astronomical data sets,
> often enormous in size, are subject to both exploratory statistical
> analysis and complex parametric astrophysical modeling. A vast range of
> problems is encountered: multivariate analysis and clustering, survival
> analysis, data mining, nonparametric analysis, density estimation,
> spatial statistics, image processing, and time series analysis.
>
> The cross-disciplinary SCMA conferences held at Penn State in 1991, 1996,
> and now 2001 are designed to bring together observational astronomers
> with leading statisticians to discuss these issues.  Topics emphasized
> in SCMA III include:
>     * Observational Cosmology
>     * Large Astronomical Databases and Visualization
>     * Bayesian Methodologies
>     * Statistical Computation
>     * Wavelet Analysis
>     * Time Series Problems
> The conference will have invited speakers with both prepared and impromptu
> discussion, and a poster session of contributed papers.  Tutorials provide
> a foundation on selected topics.  Both statisticians and astronomers
> are invited to the conference. Limited funds are available to support
> students and young researchers.
>
> This announcement provides information for prospective participants:
> critical dates, scientific program, Scientific Organizing Committee
