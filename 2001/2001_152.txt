>                      * SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE *
>
> The study of central activity in galaxies is one of the most rapidly
> changing and dynamic topics in modern astrophysics.
>
> First, impressive progress have been made during the last years and
> is expected in the near future, concerning the physics of the central
> engine in active galactic nuclei (AGNs), as a consequence of data
> flows from space missions, such as ASCA, Chandra, FUSE, HST, HUT,
> ISO, XMM, and from high-resolution ground-based observations.
> Presently, there is almost no doubt that an accretion flow is located
> very close to the supermassive black hole (SBH), and that general
> relativistic effects shape the observed spectrum. Mapping of the
> Broad Line Region, variability and spectral studies in the X-rays
> allow to constrain the mass of the SBH, and the structure and
> physical properties of the hot and cold flows in its neighborhood.
> New evidence exists for winds on various spatial scales, and
> multiwavelength monitoring from radio to very high energy allows to
> understand the relation between the disk and the jet in
> radio loud objects. These new results require one to understand the
> physics of the central engine and the interplay between the different
> components of its immediate environment: accretion disk, Warm
> Absorber, Broad Emission, Absorption and Narrow Line Regions, jet and
> radio core.
>
> Second, it became evident recently that nuclear starbursts and AGNs
> are not isolated in their evolution but are closely related to each
> other and possibly to their host galaxies. Understanding the
> intricacies of this symbiosis, which include different aspects of
> fueling of central engines in AGNs, physics of accretion flows,
> central star formation in the presence of radiative and mechanical
> energy deposition, evolution of supernovae remnants in a dense
> environment, dynamics of the central kiloparsec in host galaxies, and
> the role of magnetic fields, is paramount to understanding the nature
> of AGNs. A number of observational and theoretical breakthroughs,
> such as apparent ubiquity of SBHs in galactic centers, correlation
> between properties of the SBHs and bulges of host galaxies,
> footprints of ongoing star formation in Seyfert 2 galaxies, clear
> signs of gas inflows in disk galaxies towards their centers, and
> collimated and uncollimated outflows in Seyferts and quasars --- all
> this sheds new light both on the nature of AGNs and on galaxy
> evolution.
>
> The increased effort to address symbiotic relationship between the
> central engines in AGNs, surrounding accretion disks and their nearby
> and distant environments, coincides with the breakthrough in our
> computational capabilities to study more realistic theoretical
> models. Our understanding of the nature of AGNs is rapidly changing
> and causal relationships in the evolution become more visible. The
> historical division between the AGN experts and galactic dynamists
> rapidly becomes obsolete. We see our goal, therefore, in bringing
> together observers, theorists and computational scientists from both
> sides of the divide in order to summarize the achievements and decide
> on the best strategy in addressing the overall problem.
>
> Although the subject of the proposed conference has been discussed as
> an important issue in the past, it was typically divided into
> subtopics, each dealt with separately. For this Symposium to be held
> in July 2002, we intend to bring together the `mainstream' AGNs
> researchers working on the accretion flows around supermassive black
> holes and galactic dynamicists and experts on star formation and
> supernovae remnants. We shall focus principally on the observational
> and theoretical evidence for the relationship between the central
> engines in AGNs, nuclear star formation and evolution of central
> kiloparsec in disk galaxies.

>                           * LIST OF TOPICS *
>
>         The following topics will be discussed:
>
> - The central engine: X-ray and UV view, hot and cold gas, physical
> processes (gas dynamics and radiation)
> - The parsec scale: BLRs, BALRs, warm absorber, inflows and outflows
> - Radio loud AGN, jets
> - Accretion disks and tori, radiation- and MHD-flows from accretion
> disks
> - The central kiloparsec: fueling of AGN, nuclear starburts, link to
> the host galaxy, dynamics of central kpc
> - Formation of central BH and AGN, symbiosis with the host galaxy,
> cosmological aspects

>
>  The meeting will be held in the Meudon Observatory, which is located
> in a wooden area of the suburbs of Paris, particularly attractive
> during the summer. Transportation will be made by special buses from
> and to Paris each morning and evening. Travels to the observatory can
> also be made by trains, and take about 10 mn from a station located
> in the center of Paris.
>
> Preference will be given to early preregistered participants.
>
> Details about the list of confirmed invited speakers, registration
> fee, proceedings, accommodation, etc., are and will be available on
> the website. PLEASE PRE-REGISTER ON-LINE NOW TO BECOME
> PART OF OUR MAILING LIST.
