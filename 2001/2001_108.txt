Subject: SKA Meeting July 9-13, 2001 Second Announcement

                    SECOND ANNOUNCEMENT

International Science and Technology Meeting on the Square Kilometer Array

What:       The SKA: Defining the Future

Where:      Bancroft Hotel
            Berkeley, California USA
            (Adjacent to University of California Berkeley Campus)

When:       July 9 - 12, 2001
            Monday morning through Thursday noon

To be followed by a meeting of the International SKA Steering Committee
Thursday afternoon through Friday evening

Sponsors:   UC Berkeley Radio Astronomy Laboratory
            SETI Institute
            U.S. SKA Consortium

Purpose:
This will be the fifth in a series of international meetings to refine the 
strawman scientific goals of the Square Kilometer Array and examine 
cost-effective technologies for its implementation.

We will continue the practice of setting aside significant blocks of time for 
the meetings of working groups on:

   Science Working Group (members previously selected)
   Array configuration, artificial-sky simulations 
   Correlator design 
   Station antenna and beam-forming design 
   Interference mitigation techniques 
   Site evaluation and selection

Invited Speakers:
Bob Brown
John Mather
Jerry Nelson
Ron Ekers
Harvey Butcher
Jack Welch
Rick Perley
Graeme James
Sandy Weinreb
Peter Hall
Peter Dewdney
Bo Peng
Arnold van Ardenne
Phil Diamond
Jill Tarter
John Dickey
Paul Goldsmith
Leo Blitz
Frank Briggs
Peter Wilkinson
John Carlstrom
Jim Cordes
Don Backer
John Dreher
Roger Capallo
Mike Kesteven
Steve Ellingson
Bruce Thomas
Colin Lonsdale
Tim Cornwell

Both oral presentations and posters will be accommodated.  We are 
particularly interested in hearing about on-going scientific programs that 
will be significantly enhanced or transformed by the capabilities of the SKA, 
and the key scientific requirement for doing that.  We are also eager to hear 
about the technological progress that has been made since the last meeting in 
August 2000.

A web site is now available at http://www.skatelescope.org/meeting for 
on-line registration and abstract submission, as well as providing 
information regarding hotel accommodations, information about pre and post 
conference tours and activities for accompanying persons.

Please note the following important dates:

   Requests for Travel Assistance need to be received by June 1
   Abstracts are to be submitted by June 15
   On Line Registration deadline is June 30

We are looking forward to this meeting and your participation therein.

Sincerely,

Jill Tarter for the Local Organizing Committee
