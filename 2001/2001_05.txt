> The 1st announcement lead to a very large influx of feedback, for
> which we are grateful. We apologise if we were not able to reply to
> every point that was raised at this early stage. We already received a
> substantial number of abstracts (c. 20) for SCYON Issue No.1; many thanks
> to those who contributed already.
>
> We would like to ascertain that SCYON disseminates abstracts of
> research to be published on young and old star clusters, including
> embedded clusters and star-cluster formation. The authors are
> responsible for the quality of the submission, and for providing a
> correct LaTeX file. Owing to time-constraints we cannot usually edit
> each abstract, or correct wrongly submitted abstracts. The template
> has been chosen to be the same as used for the dwarf-tales newsletter,
> but this unfortunately clashes with the format of the star-formation
> newsletter. Hopefully, a unification will one day become possible.
> For the time being we decided to accept both forms.
>
> If you wish to contribute an abstract, write it in the main body of
> the mail, using the LaTeX template below (or the star-formation
> template). Our target date for the first issue is
>
>                   Issue no. 1 : January 10, 2001.
>
> A template LaTeX file and web-download are available at the web-site,
>
>              http://www.rzuser.uni-heidelberg.de/~s17/scyon
>
> The LaTeX template will be included with each issue of the newsletter sent
> out by email.
>
> The list of subject included in the newsletter is as follows :
>
> **  Abstracts from refereed articles
> **  Abstracts from conference proceedings
> **  PhD Summaries
> **  Announcements : Conferences, new databases, and the likes.
> **  Any other relevant topic ...
>
> We look forward to adding your contribution to the first issue!
