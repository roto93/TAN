>                    NEW FRONTIERS IN ASTROPHYSISCS:
>                        SQUARE KILOMETER ARRAY
>
>
>  The Square Kilometre array (SKA)is a proposed telescope that will
>  operate at metre to centimetre wavelengths with a collecting area
>  of one square kilometre (see http://www.skatelescope.org/).
>  With 100 times the collecting area of the Very Large Array and
>  angular resolution down to milliarcsecond scales, the SKA will
>  probe the structure of the early Universe and the interstellar
>  media of the first galaxies.
>
>  An international Science workshop on the Square Kilometer Array
>  will be held in Bologna (Italy) on 14 and 15 January 2002, at the
>  National Council of Research Area.
>
>  This will be followed by a one-day meeting on 16 January 2002,
>  devoted to the presentation of the SKA project to the Italian
>  astronomical community.
>
>  Finally,  there will be the Meeting of the International SKA
>  Steering Committee  on 17 January 2002.
>
>
>  The goal of the two-day Science Workshop is to identify and articulate
>  the key science drivers for the SKA that determine the technical
>  specifications. The meeting will consist of a first plenary session
>  dealing with the goals of the workshop and guidelines, followed
>  by working groups based on specific areas of astrophysics. Each
>  working group will brainstorm on the key science drivers, and
>  will report on its work at the end of the workshop.
>  The  working groups are:
>            1. The Milky Way and Local Galaxies
>            2. SETI, Stellar end products and transient sources
>            3. Early Universe and Large Scale Structure
>            4. Galaxy Evolution
>            5. Intergalactic Medium, AGN and Supermassive Black Holes
>            6. The Life Cycle of Stars
>            7. The Solar System and Planetary Science
>            8. Spacecraft Tracking
>
>  The one-day meeting on 16 January 2001 is planned to introduce
>  the SKA project to the italian community.
>  Presentations from the chairmen of the ISSC and SAC to
>  illustrate the scientific scope of the SKA, as well as talks
>  from Italian astronomers about their research area and the
>  impact of the SKA will be highlighted.
>  Topics are:
>               Stellar Evolution
>               Interstellar Matter
>               Physics of Radiosources
>               High z Galaxies
