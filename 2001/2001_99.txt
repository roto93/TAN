           Opening for the Nanoscience Research Program


  As a joint effort of the National Center for High-Performance
  Computing at Hsinchu and the DiCon Fiberoptics Inc. at
  Berkeley, a new long-term project the Nanoscience Research
  Program is initiated. This program is intended to be devoted
  to the basic research of nanoscience and the application study
  of nanotechnology. The focused topics will include, but not
  confined to, Nanostructured Materials, Photonic Materials,
  Quantum Heterostructures, etc. Theoretical investigation and
  model simulation on these nanosystems will be conducted in
  the program.

  A number of openings with very competitive salary for the
  program scientist are available. The candidates should have
  strong background in physics, chemistry or optoelectronics
  and have Bachelor or Ph.D. degree in the related fields. Not
  necessarily required, candidates with experience in scientific
  simulation are encouraged. Interested candidates should have
  vitae and two recommendation letters sent to
