> The Core Program Committee on Computational Materials Research
> is organizing a summer workshop, to be held from August 27 (Monday) -
> 29 (Wednesday), at Shi-Tou (Nan-Tou province) 南投縣台大實驗林區.
> This is the 2nd programwide meeting. We shall have about  4 one-hour
> lecture and many short talks (20 or 30 minutes) on subjects
> broadly related to our Core Program (description of physics and
> computational methods or report of results etc). The speakers
> (tentative) at present include
> J.M. Chang (NCHC), C. Cheng (NCKU), G.Y. Guo (NTU),
> H.T. Jeng (NCTS), M.H. Lee (TKU), T.C. Leung (NCCU),
> Y.T. Lu (NCKU), M.F. Lin (NCKU), S.F. Tsai (NSYSU),
> C.M. Wei (AS).
>
> The aim is to promote interaction and collaboration among local
physicists.
> The Program Committee would also like to take this opportunity to hear
about
> interests of the community in order to plan future activities at the
Center.
> Shi-Tou is a popular place for cooling off in the summer, and should
> provide a relaxing atmosphere for fruitful interactions.  Students and
> postdocs
> are also welcome. Finanical support will be available (see application
form).
>
>    If you are interested in attending, please return the registration form
