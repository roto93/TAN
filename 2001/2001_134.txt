> In his original convection experiments 100 years ago, B'enard studied
> whale oil in open dishes heated from below. He observed the now-classic
> pattern of hexagonal flow cells.  Over the next half-century, there was
> substantial confusion over the interpretation of these results. It was
> eventually understood that convection in fluids with a free surface (now
> called B'enard-Marangoni convection) may be driven by a combination of
> buoyancy and surface tension effects. These are traditionally described by
> one-layer models with various choices for the boundary conditions at the
> free surface. In fact, these conditions are difficult to impose in real
> experiments which always involve two coupled fluids in which the upper
> fluid actively participates in driving the flow.  The rich phenomenology
> of the full two-layer problem has only recently been seriously studied. We
> describe experiments on convection in layers of two immiscible liquids.
> Unlike previous studies, which used gases as the upper fluid, we find an
> unexpected square pattern close to onset which undergoes a secondary
> bifurcation to rolls at higher temperature differences. One can tune the
> ratio of buoyancy to surface tension forces by changing the depth ratio of
> the fluids. The results near onset are in quantitative agreement with
> recent two-layer weakly nonlinear theories, which fail however to predict
> the secondary bifurcation to rolls.
