****************************************************
            EUROPEAN MEETING
          CENSUS OF THE GALAXY:
CHALLENGES FOR PHOTOMETRY AND SPECTROMETRY
               WITH GAIA
           2 - 6 JULY, 2001
          VILNIUS, LITHUANIA
****************************************************

       PRELIMINARY ANNOUNCEMENT

The GAIA mission has recently been approved as one of the
next "cornerstones" of ESA's science programme, with a
launch date in 2010-2012. GAIA will provide high accuracy
astrometric, photometric and spectrometric measurements
for one billion stars. Photometric and spectrometric
measurements properly combined with parallaxes will provide
information on temperatures, luminosities, metallicities,
peculiarity types, interstellar reddening and radial
velocities of measured stars.

The aim of the conference is to estimate classification
possibilities of the photometric systems proposed for
GAIA, to evaluate classification accuracy at different
magnitude levels and to establish interaction of
astrometric, photometric and spectrometric data.

The main topics suggested for discussion at the
conference:
 1. Selection of the photometric systems
    * Comparison and analysis of the photometric systems 1F, 2A, and 3G
    * How to quantify the performance of these (and future) systems
    * Requirements and schedule for ground-based tests
    * Methods to account for interstellar extinction
    * Problems of photometric metallicity determination
    * Spectrometric/astrometric observations as complementary information

 2. Special objects:
    * Unresolved binaries and impact on stellar parameter determination
    * Identification and classification of peculiar stars
    * Multi-colour photometry of solar system objects
    * Diagnostic information on extra-solar planets
    * Multi-colour photometry of the diffuse sky background
    * Recognition and photometry-spectrometry of galaxies
    * Recognition and photometry-spectrometry of quasars
    * Detection of Pop III objects

 3. Ground-processing:
    * Photometric data reduction and calibration
    * Classification methods for the photometric-spectrometric data
    * Detection of:
      - eclipsing variables
      - supernovae and GRB
      - lensing events
      - solar system objects (phase effects)
    * Implications for quick-look analysis

 
Any omitted here important aspect of GAIA photometry or
spectrometry is welcome for discussion at the conference.


The European Meeting "Census of the Galaxy:
Challenges for Photometry and Spectrometry with GAIA"
will be held on 2-6 July, 2001 in Vilnius, Lithuania.

It is organized by Vilnius University,
Institute of Theoretical Physics and Astronomy and
Institute of Physics (Lithuania) with support of
European Space Agency.
