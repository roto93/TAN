Dear Tanet subscribers:

The following message given by Prof. Howard Yee is a series of 8 hour
lectures to be given at Taida Physics Building rm 518 from 10-12 am on
the next two Monday and Wednsday, an observational complementary of my
class on Galactic and Extra-Galactic Astronomy.  It aims for
middle-level graduate students, but it contains the introduction to 
the understanding of the hot topics listed below, suitable for advanced
astronomers in other fields to learn about. Interesting parties 
are welcome to attend these lectures.

Hi Tzi-hong:

  Here is a short list of the topics I will hope to cover 
in the 4 lectures next 2 weeks.  I am concentrating on
primarily optical observations/properties of clusters (since
you probably have talked about gas related properties etc).
The topics covered in each lecture is approximate, since
it may finish early, or spill over to the next one etc.
Let me know what you think.  Also, I see that there will
be a lot of lectures with COSPAR next week -- do those impact
on the course lectures?

  Howard
