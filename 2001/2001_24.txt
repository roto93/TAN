<h3><a name="sci_rat"></a>SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE:</h3>
<p>The evolution of galaxies has become an observational fact mainly 
after recent sky surveys (e.g. the HST deep field survey, the 
Canada-France redshift survey, or ISO deep surveys), which have shown 
that the properties of distant galaxies, formed early in the life of 
the Universe, differ from those of nearby ones. New observational 
windows at X-ray, ultraviolet, infrared and millimetric wavelengths 
(ROSAT, IUE, IRAS, ISO, IRAM) have revealed that galaxies contain a 
wealth of components (very hot gas, atomic hydrogen, molecules, dust, 
dark matter).

<p>However, theoretical modeling has not progressed as fast as the 
census of the content of galaxies. So far, most models are very 
empirical or semi-empirical. A real understanding of galaxy evolution 
requires a proper physical description of the galaxy components as 
well as of the coupling and feedback between them: stars and gas, 
cold and hot phases of the interstellar medium, large scale and small 
scale phenomena.

<p>A significant advance is expected in the near future mostly due to 
the conjunction of two circumstances. On the one hand, the 
exploration of the most distant Universe will be possible with the 
new facilities from ground and space (e.g. VLT, FIRST, XMM, etc..). 
On the other hand, the rapidly developing computing facilities will 
permit, for the first time, to provide self-consistent models of 
galaxy evolution. During the next decade, we can expect a 
breakthrough in galaxy modeling, in which all the relevant large and 
small scale processes will be taken into account in a coherent way. 
It will be possible to test this new generation of models against 
strong observational constraints.

<p>We have started a cycle of three Euroconferences on the evolution 
of galaxies. The first conference, devoted to the observational 
clues, took place in May 2000 in Grenada (Spain). The second will 
take place in October 2001 in the Island of La Reunion (France) in 
the Indian Ocean and will address the interplay between the different 
components of a galaxy: interstellar matter, star formation, stellar 
evolution and death, role of dynamics and environment. The last one 
will take place in July 2002 in Kiel (Germany) and will address the 
detailed modeling of galaxy evolution.

<p>Specialists in various fields of Astronomy, observers and 
theoreticians are expected to participate.

<h3><a name="sci_org"></a>SCIENTIFIC ORGANIZATION:</h3>
<p>The general idea of this conference is to create the appropriate 
environment for discussions between specialist of different fields, 
observers and theoreticians, to review the key inputs for galaxy 
modeling. Star formation, physics of the interstellar matter, 
relation between stellar evolution and galaxy enrichment, relation 
between galaxy evolution and environment, primeval galaxy evolution 
will be the major topics analyzed during the conference. Emphasis 
will be put on the physics of the different processes, their relative 
importance and their uncertainties. The conference is composed of a 
first day devoted to introductory presentations, followed by 5 
consecutive sessions on the different processes relevant for galaxy 
evolution. Each of the sessions will be composed of review talks, 
contributed oral presentations (these may include progress reports as 
well as critical reviews) and posters. Each session will end with a 
general discussion on a key issue for galaxy evolution introduced by 
a specialist. <p>Proceedings of the conference will be published, 
including reports of the discussions.

<h3><a name="part"></a>PARTICIPATION:</h3>
<p>Participation of young researchers from European countries is 
especially encouraged.

<p>According to the rules on Euroconferences, attendance is limited 
to 100 persons. The SOC will select the participants on the basis of 
their proposed contribution (or motivation for young researchers). 
Preference will be given to young researchers participating in all 
the three conferences of the series.

<p>The SOC will select for oral presentations the contributions 
dealing explicitly with the topic of this second conference. Posters 
are welcome, including on the topics related with the themes of the 
other conferences of the series.

<h3><a name="fees"></a>FEES: </h3>
<p>The conference fee will be 200 Euros (to be confirmed)

<h3><a name="conf_loc"></a>CONFERENCE LOCATION: </h3>
<p>The conference will take place in the Island of La R&eacute;union. 
La R&eacute;union is a French territory in the south of the Indian 
Ocean. It is located eastward of Madagascar, and very close to 
Mauritius Island. A large effort is done by the French Government to 
develop education and interest for science in La R&eacute;union. The 
heart of the educational system is the Universit&eacute; de 
l'Oc&eacute;an Indien, located in Saint-Denis, the main town of the 
island. There are two laboratories of physics, one dealing with the 
physics of the atmosphere, the second with geology and volcano 
activities. The venue of an international scientific conference 
supported by the European Community will have a strong impact on the 
local students and population in general. It is for this reason that 
we have proposed to hold this conference in La R&eacute;union. A very 
visible outreach program is associated with the conference. This 
program has received an enthusiastic support from the local 
authorities. The conference will benefit from financial support from 
the different political authorities of La R&eacute;union.

<p>The conference will take place in the Village Vacances Famille 
(VVF) located in Saint Gilles, 30 km west of Saint Denis. The VVF is 
a holiday resort composed a restaurant, a swimming pool, a conference 
room and of small houses in a park on the sea side. Each house is 
fully equipped for two persons, with one main room, toilet, bathroom, 
kitchen and an open air veranda. All houses will be refurbished 
within the next 9 months. A shopping center, medical care, small 
beach restaurants and cinemas can be found at walking distances. A 
nice beach is found just in front of the VVF premises.

<p>The conference presentations and poster sessions will take place 
in the VVF conference room, with the exception of the inaugural 
session, which will take place in an auditorium in the Saint Denis 
University. The sessions in the VVF will be split between morning and 
late-afternoon meetings. Lunch will be taken in the VVF restaurant 
and will be followed by a couple of hours for free activities 
(swimming, snorkeling, sunbathing, etc). Dinner will be served in the 
VVF restaurant. After dinner, a couple of hours will be devoted to a 
discussion of the topic of the day while enjoying local beverages. 
The fact that lodging, meals, and scientific activities are located 
in a single place benefiting of a beautiful environment should 
generate a friendly atmosphere and favor informal scientific 
discussions between the participants.

<p>In October, the weather is mildly hot, with average temperature of 
26 C in the day. It is usually sunny in the morning, with some 
possible rains in the afternoon, and a clear sky at night. Tropical 
storms and hurricanes start later during southern summer, usually not 
before December or January. The island is very safe, with no endemic 
tropical diseases. No special vaccination is required, neither 
specific life cares. Drinkable water is available everywhere. While 
being part of the high tourist season, October is more quiet than the 
peak periods of northern summer, or Christmas holidays. La Reunion is 
one of the most beautiful islands of this region. It offers a large 
variety of activities, such as trekking in the mountains in the 
volcano caldera or in deep river canyons, gliding, canoeing, 
snorkeling or scuba diving. The population of La R&eacute;union is 
well mixed, with representatives native from India, Africa, 
Madagascar and France mainland. The very different origins of the La 
R&eacute;union population give a unique flavor to the local way of 
life. An overview of La R&eacute;union can be found on the WEB site 
<a href="http://www.ilereunion.net/">http://www.ilereunion.net/</a> 
(french, english and german versions of the site are available)

<h3><a name="trans_lodg"></a>TRANSPORTATION AND LODGING:</h3>

<p>Saint Denis can be easily reached by plane from Paris. There are 3 
direct flights per day, one by Air France, one by AOM, and another by 
Corsair, the airline belonging to Nouvelles Frontieres. The fares 
range from 3800 FF (570 Euros) to 6000 FF (900 Euros). British 
Airways also also operates a regular flight to Saint-Denis. However, 
it should be noted that the reservations should be made well in 
advance, possibly early in May since these flights are often very 
crowded. For participants who do not want to travel through Paris, 
they might find direct flights to Mauritius Island, and from there 
reach Saint Denis with a 20 minutes flight. There are several daily 
flights between Mauritius and La Reunion.

<p>The lodging will be ensured from Monday October 15 night to Monday 
October 22 morning. We expect that most of the participants will 
arrive on Monday October 15 morning and leave on Monday October 22 
night. However, the conference will end on Sunday 21 early enough so 
that participants may catch the Sunday night flight to Paris (leaving 
at 9 PM). Participants can extend their stay in the VVF, either 
before, or after the meeting by a few days, at the same price 
conditions. Since we must issue a contract with the VVF in order to 
secure all the rooms, the cost for the lodging and the meals should 
be paid to the organizers at the same time as the registration fees, 
3 months before the beginning of the conference. The cost for the 
full pension is
<p align="center">2000 FF (305 euros) for a shared room 2700 FF (412 
euros) for a single room</p>

<p>(These prices may change slightly according to the actual 
attendance) <p>Transportation from and to the airport will be 
provided. The cost of this transportation, as well as of the travel 
to and from Saint-Denis University on the first conference day are 
included in the conference fees. <p>For those wishing to extend their 
stay in the island, the arrangement for extension should be done on 
an individual basis with the VVF, with a mention that the additional 
stay is linked with the conference. We recommend to rent a car, since 
travel distances for the main scenic sites are quite long and public 
transportation is almost non-existent. All main rental car companies 
have local agencies. Cars may be rented at the airport and returned 
in Saint Gilles, or vice versa. Reservation should be made in advance 
to be sure to get a car. During the conference itself, there is no 
need to have a car, since all the transports linked with the 
conference will be provided and all the facilities (shops, 
newspapers, tobacco, doctors, dentists, ...) are within walking 
distance from the VVF.

<h3><a name="support"></a>SUPPORT:</h3>
<p>Funds from the European Community are available to provide some 
support to a number of participants for attending the conference, 
mainly young researchers from the European Community and invited 
speakers. A limited amount of extra funds should also be available 
from other sources. In any case, support will be distributed on a 
case by case basis, upon request. If needed, please fill in the 
pre-registration form appropriately.

<h3><a name="social"></a>SOCIAL EVENTS: </h3>
<ul>
<li>A welcome drink offered by the Centre de Tourisme de La 
R&eacute;union during registration at VVF before the Monday 15th lunch
<li>A conference opening buffet offered by la Region de La 
R&eacute;union on the Tuesday evening in the Saint Denis University
<li>A one day excursion to the Piton de la Fournaise or to the Cirque de Cilaos
<li>A conference closing dinner offered by the Conseil General de la 
R&eacute;union on Sunday October 22.
</ul>
<p>The Tourism Office of La R&eacute;union offers two tickets for a 
helicopter ride above the island. These will be given to the two 
winners of the tombola that we will organize during the registration 
drink.

<h3><a name="public"></a>PUBLIC OUTREACH PROGRAMME:</h3>
<p>The introductory lectures on the first day of the conference 
(Tuesday October 16) are meant to provide an up-to-date overview of 
galaxy evolution not only for the participants of the conference, but 
also for students and professors of related sciences in the 
Universite de l'Ocean Indien.

<p>Two open public lectures will be given during the conference, one 
in the saint Denis University, the second in a place to be defined in 
the southern part of the island.

<p>An open public lecture on galaxy evolution will take place at the 
Observatoire des Makes, an observatory for amateur astronomers which 
is used for children of the La Reunion schools. This conference will 
be followed by informal discussions between conference participants 
and the public and by observations of nearby galaxies and Galactic 
nebulae with the telescopes of the Makes observatory.

<p>Schools with a club of astronomy will have the possibility to 
invite a participant of the conference for a lecture in the speaker's 
native language and for a open discussion.
