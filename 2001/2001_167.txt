> 3.  DISPOSITION OF ORIGINAL IUE DATA TAPES
> 
> The National Space Science Data Center (NSSDC) proposes to 
> release approximately 2000 original tapes containing data 
> from the International Ultraviolet Explorer mission. Most 
> data from this mission safely reside on newer media at the 
> Multimission Archive at STScI (MAST) and at NSSDC. A white
> paper (accessible from http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/astro/ ) 
> explores the nature of data not captured on new media, the 
> scientific potential of the data, and the costs to rescue 
> those files. The cost to rescue all file types not residing 
> on new media is significant. Early community feedback, 
> including that from MAST, leads NSSDC to believe that the 
> rescue of these few files to be an unjustified expense, and
> therefore intends to release the tapes. NSSDC welcomes 
> comments from all potential users of these data prior to 
> November 2001. NSSDC will release these tapes, unless 
> arguments against such action warrant a re-evaluation.
> Please direct comments to Dr. Joseph H. King, Head, NSSDC, 
> at mailto:joseph.h.king@gsfc.nasa.gov.

> 4. GEMINI NORTH AND SOUTH AVAILABLE FOR SCIENCE
>    Proposals Due: 30 SEPTEMBER 2001
> 
> The National Optical Astronomy Observatory announces the 
> availability of our Web proposal form for proposals for 
> observing time for the 2002A semester, from February through 
> July 2002.  Time is available on both the Gemini North and 
> South telescopes of the International Gemini Observatory,
> on the 6.5-m telescope of the MMT Observatory, on the 
> Hobby-Eberly Telescope, and on the telescopes of the 
> Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory and the 
> Kitt Peak National Observatory.  Details of instrumentation, 
> observing modes, and schedules are available on our 
> website at:
> 
> http://www.noao.edu/gateway/
> 
> Investigators applying for time on Gemini telescopes ONLY 
> may alternatively use the IGO Phase I Tool to submit their 
> proposals.  Information on the PIT is available at:
> 
> http://www.us-gemini.noao.edu/sciops/ObsProcess/ObsProcIndex.html
> 
> Proposals are due no later than 11:59 pm MST (Mountain 
> Standard Time) on Sunday, 30 September 2001.

> 5.  ARECIBO OBSERVATORY PROPOSALS
> 
> The next proposal deadline is 1 October 2001.

> 6.  SPRING 2002 CMVA GLOBAL 3mm VLBI CAMPAIGN
> 
> The Coordinated Millimeter VLBI Array project offers an 
> opportunity for Spring 2002 observing with a global 3mm VLBI 
> network. Telescopes may include Effelsberg, Onsala, Pico 
> Veleta, Haystack, and VLBA telescopes with 3mm. Five days of 
> time will be supported, with up to two days also supported at 
> the BIMA Array at Hat Creek for appropriate programs.  The
> CMVA Project will coordinate review and scheduling of projects 
> with the respective observatories.
> 
> Proposals to the CMVA should be limited to those benefiting 
> from the collecting area and resolution of a global array.   
> CMVA observing may also be used in conjunction with VLBA 3mm 
> structural studies to provide a single epoch of increased 
> resolution.  Proposal text should justify the need for 
> transcontinental resolution in a context of source component 
> sizes/brightness temperatures.
> 
> Recording modes will include VLBA modes at sustainable rates.  
> Projects that request 256 Mbits/s (nonsustainable) record 
> rates should explain why such bandwidth is crucial, and 
> restrict the tracks to 6 hours.  If redundant tracks within 
> a program are requested, the amounts and reasons should be 
> clearly stated.
> 
> PROPOSAL DEADLINE  1 October 2001 (end of calendar day)
>                    for session at 3mm in April 2002
> 
> ELECTRONIC SUBMISSION,  LaTeX/TeX, of scientific case is

> 7. PROPOSAL CALL FOR THE NRAO GREEN BANK TELESCOPE
>    Proposals Due: 1 October 2001
> 
> The next deadline for proposals for the Green Bank Telescope 
> is 1 October 2001.  This call is for frequencies up to 26.5 GHz 
> and includes most basic observing modes.  More detailed information 
> on the proposal call may be found at
> 
> http://www.nrao.edu/GBT/proposals 
> 
> Proposals should be submitted using the new version (v1.1) 
> of the Proposal Submission Tool (PST).  Please delete any 
> previous versions you may have, and download and install the 
> new version, which may be found at the web address above.
> 
> Questions on proposal submission and status may be directed 
> to Carl Bignell (mailto:cbignell@nrao.edu, or 304-456-2165).  
> Questions about GBT observing instruments or capabilities may be 
> directed to Ron Maddalena (mailto:rmaddale@nrao.edu, or 304-456-2207).

> 8.  LIMITED ACCESS TO NIRSPEC ON KECK II AVAILABLE TO
>     GEMINI COMMUNITY
>     Proposals due: 8 October 2001
> 
> Scientists from the Gemini partner countries are invited 
> once again to apply for time on the 1-5 micron spectrograph, 
> NIRSPEC, on the 10-m Keck II Telescope. In the current 2001B 
> semester, the final semester of the program, the W. M. Keck 
> Observatory has allocated 3 nights to the Gemini Observatory. 
> Observations will be carried out in a "Service Observing" mode, 
> with Gemini staff executing the observations on behalf of 
> successful applicants from the Gemini partnership. Proposals 
> for use of this NIRSPEC time are to be submitted to the Gemini 
> Observatory and will be reviewed and prioritized by external 
> scientific referees and internal technical assessors.
> 
> The Gemini NIRSPEC observing time in semester 2001B is scheduled 
> on November 20-22. Proposals are due by 8 October. Further 
> information about this opportunity, including application forms 
> and more detailed information about NIRSPEC, is available on 
> the Gemini web pages, via the home page 
> 
> http://www.gemini.edu/ 
> 
> and the NIRSPEC page
