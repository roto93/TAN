1.  DID YOU KNOW? NOMINAL AAS TRIVIA

Did you know that current AAS President Anneila Sargent and
incoming President-Elect Caty Pilachowski were once competitors? 
According to their membership nomination forms, they both began
their careers searching for the magnetic fields in peculiar
A stars.

You receive this tid-bit of trivia as a Member in good standing.
We thank you. Please encourage your colleagues and graduate 
students to join or renew now. (Especially if they are planning 
on presenting a paper at the Pasadena Meeting.)

4.  NOAO OBSERVING PROPOSALS DUE 31 MARCH 2001
    GEMINI NORTH AND SOUTH AVAILABLE FOR SCIENCE

The National Optical Astronomy Observatory announces the
availability of our web proposal form for proposals for
observing time for the 2001B semester, from August 2001,
through January 2002.  Time is available on both the
Gemini North and South Telescopes of the International
Gemini Observatory, on the 6.5-m telescope of the MMT
Observatory, on the Hobby-Eberly Telescope, and on the
telescopes of the Cerro Tololo InterAmerican Observatory
and of the Kitt Peak National Observatory.  Details of
instrumentation, observing modes, and schedules are
available on our website at 

        http://www.noao.edu/gateway/

Investigators applying for time on Gemini telescopes 
ONLY may alternatively use the IGO Phase I Tool to
submit their proposals.  Information on the PIT
is available at:

http://www.us-gemini.noao.edu/sciops/ObsProcess/ObsProcIndex.html

Proposals are due no later than 11:59 PM on Saturday,
31 March 2001.

5.  ASP 113TH ANNUAL MEETING & SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM
    ST. PAUL MINNESOTA, 13-18 July 2001

The first symposium dedicated to results from the Chandra 
X-ray Observatory, will be held 16-18 July 2001 as part of 
the Astronomical Society of the Pacific's 113th Annual Meeting.  
Entitled "The High-Energy Universe at Sharp Focus: A Symposium 
of Chandra Science," this international meeting will include 
all major science areas covered by Chandra observations. The 
program has been organized to highlight review talks plus 
posters and provide ample time for discussion.

The meeting website, which includes the program and 
registration and abstract submission (deadline is 18 May) 
information, is at 

        http://www.aspsky.org/meetings/2001/science.html.

6.  CONNECTING QUARKS WITH THE COSMOS: CALL FOR COMMUNITY INPUT 
    Before 30 March 2001

The NRC's Committee on the Physics of the Universe (CPU)
was charged by DOE, NASA, and NSF with identifying science
opportunities at the intersection of physics and astronomy 
and recommending strategies for realizing these science
opportunities.  The NRC has recently issued the Phase I CPU
report:  Connecting Quarks with the Cosmos:  11 Science
Questions for the New Century.  The report is available 
on-line in its entirety at 

        http://www.nas.edu/bpa/reports/cpu/index.html.

The Committee believes that there are extraordinary
opportunities for breakthroughs in our understanding of 
the Universe in which we live and the fundamental laws 
which govern it.  We are beginning the critical second 
phase of our activity.  The goal of Phase II is to identify 
strategies for realizing the 11 timely science opportunities.  
This will include making recommendations on how the agencies 
can most effectively cooperate and coordinate their programs 
in this area and identifying a set of projects that can realize 
the opportunities identified in the Phase I report.

The CPU needs and seeks input from the broad community
of astronomers and physicists on agency cooperation/
coordination issues and projects to realize the opportunities
before us.  We also welcome advice on any other aspect of
implementing the Connecting Quarks with the Cosmos science.
Comments should be sent to mailto:q2c@nas.edu.

The CPU is especially interested in being informed about
specific projects (experimental or theoretical) that directly
address any of the 11 science questions identified in the
Phase I report.

We encourage astronomers and physicists to tell us about
ideas and projects, from new concepts to relatively mature
experimental and observational proposals.  We ask that
such descriptions be sent to mailto:q2c@nas.edu.  These informal
descriptions should be no longer than 2 pages and should
contain:

1.  Name of contact person and contact information
2.  Discussion of the scientists who will or might be involved
3.  Description of project and techniques used, list of key
    technical challenges and any new technologies
    requiring R&D
4.  Rough estimate of cost and schedule
5.  Description of the science questions that will be
    addressed and, to the extent possible, the science
    reach
6.  Discussion of plans for or potential/need for multi-agency
    involvement

**The CPU would like to receive these descriptions as soon
as feasible, and if possible, before 30 March 2001. This will
permit us to start inviting groups to make presentations.**

Based upon the information received, the CPU will invite
presentations of projects that have significant potential to
address our 11 science questions at upcoming CPU meetings
associated with the APS April meeting in Washington, DC, the
AAS June meeting in Pasadena, the Snowmass meeting in
July and further meetings to be announced.

The Phase I report will be presented at a public session at
the April APS meeting and members of the CPU will be present
to answer questions and receive comments.  The following
are the 11 science opportunities identified in "Connecting
Quarks with the Cosmos:"

- What is the dark matter?
- What are the masses of the neutrinos, and how have they
  shaped the evolution of the universe?
- Are there additional spacetime dimensions?
- What is the nature of the dark energy?
- Are protons unstable?
- How did the universe begin?
- Did Einstein have the last word on gravity?
- How do cosmic accelerators work and what are they accelerating?
- Are there new states of matter at exceedingly high density
  and temperature?
- Is a new theory of matter and light needed at the highest
  energies?
- How were the elements from iron to uranium made?

A more complete description of the questions and their
context is contained in the Phase I report (available at
http://www.nas.edu/bpa/reports/cpu/index.html).

Current members of the CPU are:
Michael S. Turner, The University of Chicago, Chair
Roger D. Blandford, California Institute of Technology
Sandra M. Faber, University of California at Santa Cruz
Thomas K. Gaisser, University of Delaware
Fiona Harrison, California Institute of Technology
John P. Huchra, Harvard University
Helen R. Quinn, Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
R. G. Hamish Robertson, University of Washington
Bernard Sadoulet, University of California at Berkeley
Frank J. Sciulli, Columbia University
David N. Spergel, Princeton University
J. Anthony Tyson, Lucent Technologies
Frank A. Wilczek, Massachusetts Institute of Technology
Clifford Will, Washington University, St. Louis
Bruce D. Winstein, The University of Chicago
