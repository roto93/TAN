>  The Square Kilometre array (SKA) is a proposed telescope that will
>  operate at metre to centimetre wavelengths with a collecting area
>  of one square kilometre (see http://www.skatelescope.org/).
>  With 100 times the collecting area of the Very Large Array and
>  angular resolution down to milliarcsecond scales, the SKA will
>  probe the structure of the early Universe and the interstellar
>  media of the first galaxies.
> 
>  The Istituto di Radioastronomia is pleased to announce an international
>  Science workshop on the Square Kilometer Array to be held in Bologna
>  (Italy) on 14 and 15 January 2002, at the National Council of Research
>  Area.
> 
>  This will be followed by a one-day meeting on 16 January 2002,
>  devoted to the presentation of the SKA project to the Italian
>  astronomical community. This meeting will also be held in English.
> 
>  Finally,  there will be the Meeting of the International SKA
>  Steering Committee  on 17 and 18 January 2002.
