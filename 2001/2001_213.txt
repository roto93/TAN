>      Nanostructure science is a very broad and highly interdisciplinary
>  area of research that has been speeding unprecedentedly worldwide in
>  recent years. Focused researches in this direction are deemed to have
>  great impacts on both basic sciences and technologies. Especially, recent
>  advances in novel quantum transport phenomena have become very powerful
>  probes for the properties of nanoscopic and mesoscopic structures.
>  Electronic devices that are small enough to display quantum phenomena,
>  e.g. carbon nanotubes,quantum dots and granular metals, might soon lead
>  to realization of phase-coherent quantum electronics. Meanwhile,
>  experimental studies in this direction have been puting forward
>  continuous challenges and demands on theoretical efforts. The ability to
>  develop and fabricate new functional materials based on nanostructures
>  will eventually benefit our globe.
>
>     Foreseeing the high potential significance of the nanostructure
>  science,and the importance and advantages of joint global efforts in this
>  sprouting field of research, RIKEN and NCTS have gratefully decided to
>  initiate and sponsor for this Workshop with the support of Institute of
>  Physics, Academia Sinica and University of Tsukuba. The objective is to
>  help bring the current issues and the future trend in the field of
>  nanostructure science into focus, and to foster close collaborations
>  between research groups in Japan and Taiwan. RIKEN and NCTS have in mind
>  of developing this Workshop into a series of workshops that will hold
>  regularly (annually or bi-annually) in Japan and Taiwan.
