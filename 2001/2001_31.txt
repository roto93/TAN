Subject: Science's Human Genome Issue

**DISCOVER THE FUTURE...
IN SCIENCE'S UPCOMING HISTORIC PUBLICATION OF THE 
SEQUENCED HUMAN GENOME**

Dear AAAS Member:

Beginning February 12, Science readers will witness the unveiling of an 
historic scientific achievement: the publication of the sequence for the 
human genome. The suite of peer-reviewed papers appearing 
exclusively in Science reveals a number of seminal findings, whose 
implications will reverberate throughout the research community for 
years to come. 

Key papers and perspectives presented in this issue will also provide a 
context in which to place this historic breakthrough. What do the data 
mean and what are the implications for genetic disease? How will a 
deeper understanding of the human genome effect the way we see 
ourselves...the potential for racial and other forms of 
discrimination...the future of the field? What advances can be 
anticipated in genome-related research in the future?

In addition, Science readers will get a deep look behind the data. You'll 
learn how this innovative research team developed a revolutionary 
technique for sequencing the genome, known as "the shotgun strategy." 
As a direct result, the 95% complete sequence has been achieved both 
more accurately (estimated at 99.96%), and *much* sooner than had 
initially been expected by the planners of the government-based 
project. You'll gain new insights on the implications of this research for 
molecular evolution, data mining, and bioinformatics through Science's 
unique analysis and expert opinions. 

This historic issue of Science will be posted online, free of charge, on 
February 12, and will appear in print on February 16. The printed issue 
will also contain the 11th in Science's series of Genome Maps, as well 
as a giant 4' X 4' poster of the sequenced genome irectl from the 
research.

Watch for your issue in the mail, and look for further coverage of 
genetics research in Science over the next several months.  As 
researchers continue to explore this critical field, Science editors will 
keep you up-to-date.

Sincerely,

Don Kennedy
Science's Editor-in-Chief
