First announcement
------------------

The Australia Telescope National Facility is holding the 5th
Astronomical Synthesis Imaging Workshop during the week of 24-28
September 2001. This will take place at the Australia Telescope Compact
Array near Narrabri, NSW. The workshop is primarily aimed at
developing an appreciation of synthesis imaging techniques amongst
postgraduate students and the broader astronomy community.

The workshop will consist of a series of lectures and tutorials,
a tour of the observatory and some practical sessions using the
telescope. A range of topics (from introductory to more advanced)
will be covered, including

    * Basic concepts of synthesis imaging
    * Fourier transforms
    * Antennas, receivers and correlators
    * Calibration and self-calibration
    * Deconvolution and image analysis
    * VLBI
    * Spectral line techniques
    * Mosaicing and merging single dish data
    * Millimetre wave synthesis techniques
    * Practical observing and data reduction techniques

Accommodation will be arranged in Narrabri township. Some travel and
accommodation assistance will be available for students.

Closing date for registration is 28 July.
