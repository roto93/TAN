> 1.  LETTER FROM AAS PRESIDENT 
> 
> Fellow AAS members,
> 
> We are all reeling in the wake of the recent terrorist 
> attacks in New York City and Washington, D.C.  Most of us 
> have been touched directly or indirectly by these attacks 
> and the anger that we feel can make it difficult to carry 
> on with our normal lives, let alone engage in social or
> political discussion.  However, at times like these, it is 
> especially appropriate that we rededicate ourselves to 
> maintaining an environment that is supportive and
> protective of all members of the astronomical community
> 
> Our profession is a truly global one.  The condolences from 
> colleagues around the world show that regardless of religion 
> or nationality, all civilized people stand together against 
> terrorism.  We know that responsibility for these terrible 
> acts does not lie within one nation or ethnic group.  Yet 
> already some have lashed out at Muslim Americans and
> sadly we have heard of students who have chosen to leave 
> their institutions for fear of verbal or physical violence.  
> Such an atmosphere of fear is unfair, intolerable and completely 
> incompatible with the professional and scholarly values of 
> the American Astronomical Society.
> 
> The AAS respects and affirms the value and unity of all 
> members of the astronomy community, including visitors from 
> other nations and members of all ethnic groups.  We urge all 
> AAS members to take responsibility for ensuring that our 
> profession is one that welcomes and celebrates diversity.
> 
> Sentiments of vengeance and hatred have no place in our 
> institutions of higher learning, observatories, laboratories 
> and other workplaces.  We encourage department chairs and 
> others in positions of authority to assume leadership in 
> informing colleagues of relevant institutional non-discrimination 
> policies and of relevant institutional grievance procedures.  
> We especially encourage sensitivity towards our students,
> who may not feel empowered to seek out support on their own 
> and whose needs for advocacy might otherwise go undetected.
> 
> While we encourage the use of institutional resources wherever 
> possible, AAS members Kevin Marvel (mailto:marvel@aas.org) and 
> Keivan Stassun (mailto:keivan@astro.wisc.edu) have volunteered 
> to act as informal ombudspersons. Feel free to contact them with 
> questions or concerns.
> 
> Let us stand united by a dedication to help build a profession, 
> a nation and a world free of racism and ethnic violence.
> 
> Sincerely,
> 
> Anneila Sargent
> President
> American Astronomical Society

> 2.  VISIT THE HILL AFTER THE AAS JANUARY MEETING
> 
> On Friday, 11 January 2002, after the conclusion of the
> AAS Washington Meeting, members are encouraged to pay a visit
> to the offices of their Congressional Representatives.  Although
> many members of Congress will be in the home district at that 
> time, useful visits with Congressional staff can still be made.
> 
> As a service to members, Kevin Marvel (mailto:marvel@aas.org) 
> will help arrange visits to Hill offices and offer advice on how 
> to conduct an office visit.  If enough members are interested, 
> an informal Friday morning coffee klatch can be arranged to 
> discuss particular strategies and current information.
> 
> Please send email to Marvel if you are interested in visiting 
> the Hill.
