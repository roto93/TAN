BIMA: Call for Proposals (Spring 2002 observing)

Proposal Deadline

Wednesday, January 16, 2002 (11:59 pm CST) is the deadline for BIMA proposals
requesting use of the 10-element interferometer for B, C, and D
arrays at 3 mm and 1 mm for the period March 2002 through June 2003.  
Proposers should note that the amount of time suitable for B-array 
observations in the upcoming cycle is expected to be extremely limited.



Warning

We often receive proposals that will not process correctly. We have neither
the time nor the personnel to deal with these errors. For your convenience,
a list of some errors people have made has been added to the Instructions
for BIMA Observing Proposals. Any proposal containing one of these errors is
subject to being summarily dropped from consideration. If we can't process
it, we can't send it to the referees, and you won't get observing time! It
is as simple as that. We recommend that you Latex the final version of your
proposal, proofread it carefully, and then follow the submission
instructions exactly.
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

General Reminders

  1. Use new version 1.9 of bimaprop.tex and bimaprop.sty.
  2. Standard track lengths in A, B, and C arrays are 8 hours or the time
     the source is at least 12 degrees above the horizon, whichever is
     least. Projects requiring additional integration time should request
     (and justify the need for) multiple tracks. If you need less than a
     full track, specify this via the min-max hours. A short track is not
     the same thing as a Filler track. Filler tracks take lower priority and
     will be fit into the schedule only when there are open slots in the
     desired LST range.
  3. Projects requesting A array time should first obtain B array data. This
     is necessary in order to assess the feasibility of the A array
     observations and to aid in planning optimal observing strategies. Your
     technical justification should address the issues of feasibility and
     strategy.
  4. D array tracks generally should be shorter than standard A, B, and C
     array tracks. D array gives dense coverage of the inner uv plane in 2-3
     hours. Longer tracks may be desired with weak sources or when mosaicing
     large areas. However, shadowing in D array becomes severe away from the
     meridian at certain declinations. D array tracks should be no longer
     than 3 hours south of -10 degrees and no longer than 2 hours south of
     -15 degrees.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Projects involving more than 5 tracks per configuration must be submitted as
"Key" proposals. See WHAT'S NEW? for the policy on Key proposals

Due to weather constraints, 1 mm observing time is very limited and not
guaranteed. Projects at 1 mm are best done with a collaborator at one of the
BIMA institutions.

Are you on a BIMA email exploder? If not, and you wish to be kept informed
about scheduling and other matters, send email to bimasched@astro.uiuc.edu
asking that your name be added to the exploder.
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Electronic submission process

Be sure to download the latest LaTeX Proposal Style file bimaprop.sty and
LaTeX Proposal Cover Sheet bimaprop.tex (version 1.9, updated 04/17/00)
before preparing your proposal. At the top of both forms is the version
number and date.

For more details, see proposal procedures. In Brief:

  1. Email your filled-in LaTex coversheet form to
     ``bimaprop-submit@astro.uiuc.edu''
  2. Wait for a response from the automated BIMA email handler. The response
     will inform you of the proposal ID number assigned to your proposal.
     Take a note of this proposal ID number.
  3. Then if you have any Additional Files, the response will also instruct
     you how to submit them.

Detailed information on the technical capabilities of the instrument and the
proposal procedures are available by the following electronic methods:

  1. The BIMA Web server: http://bima.astro.umd.edu. Click here to view the
     instructions directly.
  2. By email: (This is an automated service; do not send questions here.)
     a) For a single-file summary of instructions, send email to
     bimaprop-info@astro.uiuc.edu.
     b) For basic proposal materials, send email to
     bimaprop-request@astro.uiuc.edu. The materials will be returned to you
     in several messages.
  3. By anonymous ftp to ftp.astro.uiuc.edu . Change into the
     pub/BIMA/proposal directory and consult the README and
     call_for_proposals.txt files to determine which files you need.
