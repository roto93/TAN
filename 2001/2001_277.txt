Subject: Global e-VLBI Workshop - First Announcement


Connecting the Global VLBI Array in the New Era of High-Speed Networks
-
MIT Haystack Observatory
Westford, MA, USA
-
8-9 April 2002
-
a workshop sponsored by
-
International VLBI Service (IVS) <ivscc.gsfc.nasa.gov>
Global VLBI Working Group (GVWG)
MIT Haystack Observatory <http://www.haystack.edu/>

1st ANNOUNCEMENT (please distribute further as desired)
-----------------------
-
---------------
Objectives
---------------
With the world increasingly wired for high-speed data communications, the 
prospects for routine global electronic transmission of VLBI data (dubbed 
'e-VLBI') become brighter every day. Not only will e-VLBI help to eliminate 
costly and complex recording equipment, but it should eventually lead to 
data rates and volumes unattainable by traditional recording equipment. 
This will lead to improved sensitivity, allowing new science to be explored 
at lower costs.
-
This international two-day meeting at MIT Haystack Observatory is being 
organized to explore the current state of high-speed astronomy data 
transmission, concentrating on e-VLBI, but recognizing the synergy with 
other astronomy applications requiring real-time or near-real-time 
high-speed data transmissions. Among the topics to be discussed:
-
- International networking facilities - now and future
- User requirements for high-speed networking
- Reports on current and projected e-VLBI and related efforts
- Networking protocols for real-time data transmission
- Public vs. dedicated networks
..- Establishing international standards for e-VLBI data transfer
-
Contribution of oral and poster presentations is encouraged. We expect most 
presentations to be of a technical nature, but encourage potential users to 
make their needs and wishes known as well. In addition, we plan to invite 
key networking specialists and providers to present their view and 
projections for meeting the challenges presented by e-VLBI and to provide a 
forum for interaction with the VLBI/astronomy community.

Location
-------------
The workshop will be hosted by MIT Haystack Observatory in Westford, 
Massachusetts, USA. Haystack Observatory is situated amid rolling hills on 
1300 forested acres of MIT land 35 miles northwest of Boston. The meeting 
will take place at the Observatory, which offers comfortable and spacious 
surroundings with modern conference facilities. Early April is the very 
beginning of spring in central New England, typified by cool sunny days and 
crisp clear nights, though the weather can be quite unpredictable during 
this time of year.
