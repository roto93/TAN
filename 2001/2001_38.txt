>   The aim of this workshop is to get together people who work on the
>   polarization of diffuse emission of galactic and extragalactic origins,
>   from hundred MHz to hundred GHz. In this wide spectral region many
>   researchers are currently joining their efforts at increasing knowledge
>   as well as at improving observing techniques, both from ground and
>   space. Several ground experiments on CMB polarization are collecting
>   data, others are being prepared together with balloon experiments,
>   while space missions on CMB including polarization investigations are
>   going to be realised soon. New observations of galactic linearly
>   polarized emission are in progress, by using radiotelescopes, at
>   frequencies up to a few GHz.
>
>   Polarization measurements (Stokes Q and U) are always more challenging
>   than total intensity (Stokes I) ones; they require particular observing
>   techniques and dedicated instrumentation as well as peculiar data
>   processing to be successful. It is thus very important to bring the
>   whole community together, facing many common problems, and having the
>   opportunity for a mutual exchange of ideas.
>
>   In three day discussion we wold like to address both theoretical and
>   experimental topics in order to take stock of the situation about the
>   subject.
