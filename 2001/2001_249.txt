Dear Reader,
  As you may know, the next meeting to formulate the next 10-yr plan for 
astronomy in Taiwan is at the end of this week.  I plan to give a report (brief 
summary) on the first meeting in October at Cupertino, California, this 
Wednesday, at 3:30 pm.  I hope that all staff members of ASIAA and maybe also 
Taiwanese committee members who missed the Cupertino meeting may like to attend. 
 I would like to strongly encourage postdocts and students who plan or hope to 
have an influence in the future of astronomy in Taiwan to also attend.
