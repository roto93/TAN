FIRST CALL FOR AN INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON:

"NEW HORIZONS IN GLOBULAR CLUSTER ASTRONOMY"

Padova, Italy, June 24-28, 2002

Dear Colleague:

This email  is to invite  you to attend  the meeting "New  Horizons in
Globular Cluster Astronomy" to be held in Padova, on June 24-28 2002.

The intended purpose of the  meeting is to bring together experts from
the full variety of fields  of research spanning globular clusters and
their stars,  to summarize the  great developments in both  theory and
observations which  have taken  place during the  last decade,  and to
pose and  define clearly  the new questions  and ideas for  the decade
ahead.  Some  of the major  new data sets  would be presented  for the
first time,  along with their interpretation and  implications for the
future  work to  be done.   The  conference is  intended to  stimulate
active  discussion  and  intellectual  cross-fertilisation  among  the
different  branches of globular  cluster research,  and to  develop or
refine  scientific strategies  for the  major ongoing  and forthcoming
facilities, missions, and surveys,  both from the ground (VLT, Gemini,
Keck, etc.) and space (HST, SIM, GAIA, NGST, etc.).

The  meeting is  intended to  honor one  of the  great figures  of the
globular cluster research - Ivan R. King - in his 75th birthday.


TOPICS TO BE ADDRESSED:
The topics covered will include, but will not be limited to:

- Theory of dynamical evolution
- Dynamical simulations
- Proper motions
- Radial velocities
- Fitting dynamical models to observations
- CMDs and LFs from large sample of stars
- Distances and Ages
- Main sequence stars
- Theory of evolved stars
- Interplay of stellar evolution and stellar dynamics
- Metallicity anomalies
- Variable and binary stars
- Exotic objects
- Fundamental correlations of cluster properties and their origins
- Evolution of the Galactic globular cluster system
- Extragalactic globular cluster systems
- GAIA and SIM

----------------------------------------------------------------------

We have invited a number of  leaders in the field to give review talks
(see below). We shall devote time for general discussion sessions, and
have still slots for a number of additional talks and for an unlimited
number of posters.


DATES AND VENUE:  Padova, Italy, June 24-28, 2002

Padova is  a nice  city, known for  its old university,  where Galileo
Galilei spent (using  his words) "the 18 best years  of his life", and
made all his fundamental astronomical observations.

Padova  is less than  30 minutes  by  train  from downtown  Venice, 50
minutes by  train from downtown Verona,  and a little bit  more than 1
hour from  Bologna. June  and September are  the best months  to visit
Padova, and we invite you to come with your family and spend some time
for sightseeing.


REGISTRATION OF INTEREST 

If you  wish to be on  our mailing list, or  if you wish  to present a
contribution,  please  fill  the  pre-registration  form       on  the
conference Web page http://menhir.pd.astro.it/newhorizons, or fill the
form below and send it to: newhorizons@pd.astro.it


ACCOMMODATION

We are presently reserving a number  of rooms at special rates for the
meeting.  Average prices  are  between 60  and  140 euros  (1 euro  is
approximately 0.9 US$). Information  on hotel reservation will be soon
posted on the web page.  We  strongly advice you to reserve your hotel
room as soon as possible, as June  is a high peak of the turist season
in Padova.


TRANSPORTATION

Padova is very  well linked to the rest of Italy  by train.  Padova is
also very  close to the  Venice and Verona  airports from where  it is
easy to reach your hotel, by bus  (about 1 hr) or using a door to door
service (20-30min) that  you should reserve in advance  via e-mail. We
advice  you to  use Venice  airport, as  there are  many  more flights
from/to almost everywhere in Europe (there are also a few direct links
from/to USA).


Additional information are in the Web page.

REGISTRATION FEES
These have  not yet been  finalised, but they  will likely be  no more
than 275 Euros, including lunches and proceedings.

CURRENCY 
Since January  1, 2002 the only currency  in Italy (as in  most of the
other countries of the European Community)  will be the Euro (1 euro =
0.9 US$).

Grants:

We  would like  to be  able to  participate in  your travel  and local
expenses, although at the moment  the total amount is still uncertain,
depending  on  various national  grant  applications  which are  still
pending.   The  final amount  of  money  available  may also  be  used
primarily to support students  and colleagues from countries with weak
currencies.  Students who absolutely  need some support are invited to
indicate it.   We expect  to not  be able to  decide about  grants for
participants before  the beginning  of the meeting.   Consequently, we
urge you to look for your own way to support your expences.
