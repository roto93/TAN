Dear CosPA members,

Today we heard a nice talk about the measurement of H_0 
using the SZ effect given by Ms. Lin in the CosPA Journal club. 
As I commented in the middle of the journal club, 
there is a very recent paper about the same topic "A Measurement 
of H_0 from the SZ effect" posted in the archive on Jan 11 2001, 
written by Mason et al. (astro-ph/0101169). 

I recommend this preprint in the case you are interested in
this topic that is also directly related to our AMiBA 
project.

cheers,

Hun
