Hello,

We are 2 french astronomers, working at ephemeris (you can see our web
pages at : www.bdl.fr), and especially at meteor storms. Perhaps you
know that there will be a great shower on next Nov 18th, visible in east
Asia (Leonids).

In order to observe it, we are looking for a place to go, and it seems
to us that East of Taiwan Island would be nice (if it is not so
cloudy...).

We are looking for professional (or amator) astronomers to "guide" us,
because we need a place safe from light pollution, and with
electricity (because we have an intensified camera). As we are "a bit"
in a hurry, we also need help for accomodations...

So, please, could you forward this request to any interested person?

Thanks a lot for any help !!!

Best wishes.

Jeremie VAUBAILLLON

RADIO-TELESCOPE
ARRAY EMMETT

RE : Support AMSETI / NEO research.

AMSETI / NEO is a 7 dish array of Radio-telescopes deticated to S.E.T.I.
(Search for ExtraTerrestial Intelligence), and N.E.O. (Near Earth Object)
monitoring. AMSETI/NEO ARRAY is online 24 hours aday scanning the sky for
possilbe target signals that warrant monitoring.

AMSETI/NEO also will soon be adding an Optical - SETI, which is a 20
foot optical telescope with image processing and analysis software for 
Deep space imaging. This is set to be constructed in early 2002.

Starting in Janurary 2002, you can download software from a link at 
AMSETI/NEO web site to monitor in real-time the AMSETI/NEO ARRAY on your 
own computer.  Watch as the array picks-up spikes, pulses and unkown 
signals for processing.  Reserve your password and newsletter by becoming
member of AMSETI/NEO.  Join the AMSETI/NEO Team for $24.95 per year and 
help support the research efforts. You will receive monthly 
electronic-newsletter on our progress and events at the station,
Receive software and your personal password to access the server at the
AMSETI/NEO facility to monitor the research efforts.

Send check or money order to: AMSETI/NEO ARRAY
			      2097 North Washington Ave.

Your support is greatly appreciated and if you have any questions, please
