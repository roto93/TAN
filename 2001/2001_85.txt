                Molecular Synthesis in the Late Stages of Stellar
                Evolution

abstract:
========
How did life originate from Earth?  Since the Millar-Urey experiment in
1953, it has been commonly believed that life developed from simple
inorganic molecules.  However, recent astronomical observations in the
millimeter and infrared spectra have discovered many large, complex,
organic molecules.  In this talk, we will present recent results from the
Infrared Space Observatory showing that stars can synthesize organic
molecules from simple acetylene to complex molecules with aromatic and
aliphatic structures over only a few thousand years.  These molecules are
then ejected into the interstellar medium at a high rate, and could be
present in the primordial solar nebula from which the Earth was formed.

We will give a brief overview of the late stages of stellar evolution, the
discovery of stars undergoing active molecular synthesis, and also the
mystery of the unidentified emission feature at 21 microns believed to be
arising from a complex carbon-based molecule.
