        Workshop on Computation Fluid Mechanics-MagnetoHydroDynamics
                           ( CFD-MHD Workshop )
                         3-12-2001 and 3-13-2001
           Website: http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/Announcements

     Institute of Astronomy & Astrophysics of Academia Sinica (ASIAA), 
Institute of Mathematics of Academia Sinica (ASIM), Department of Mathematics 
of National Taiwan University, and National Center for Theoretical Sciences
(NCTS) will sponsor a mini-workshop on CFD-MHD in astrophysics next month. The 
dates are 3-12 and  3-13 (Monday and Tuesday). The place will be in the 
Biochemistry Building in Academia Sinica, Nankang, where ASIAA is located.

     We have 4 lecturers: Professors Frank Shu of UC-Berkeley, Paul 
Woodward of U-Minnesota, Phil Collela of UC-Berkeley, and Jim Stone of
U-Maryland. Frank Shu will talk about the MHD problems in
astrophysics. Paul Woodward will talk about their recent work on stellar 
convections and their latest developments in numerical methods. 
Phil Collela has not outlined his talk yet. Jim Stone will talk about the 
Zeus code. We have asked them to prepare their lectures to a level that 
graduate students will not be totally at lost.

     The format will be that each of the invited lecturers will give
two one-hour talk plus a 30-min discussion period. There will be short
presentations mostly from our local people who will give a 20-min presentation 
plus 5-min question answer period, at the end of each day. We will ask Dr. Ue-li 
Pen of CITA, U-Toronto to give a 40-min talk on his cosmology calculations, 
using moving meshes, during the short presentation period.
