> Applications are invited for the Bolton Fellowship, a three-year
> post-doctoral appointment tenable at the major Australia Telescope
National
> Facility locations. Bolton Fellows are encouraged to undertake research
> and/or development in any area relevant to ATNF observational
capabilities.
> The ATNF facilities provide unique opportunities to observe the Southern
> sky including the Magellanic Clouds and the richest part of our Galaxy.
>
> The ATNF, a Division of CSIRO and Australia's premier radio astronomical
> facility, has its Sydney Headquarters at the Radiophysics Laboratory, and
> operates the Parkes 64m telescope, the Narrabri Compact Array and the
Mopra
> 22m telescope near Coonabarabran. The Compact Array has six 22m antennas
on
> a 6km east-west baseline with a 220m north-south spur and operates in six
> bands between 20cm and 3mm. Among other receivers, the Parkes telescope
has
> a 13-beam focal-plane-array receiver system operating in the 20cm band,
> primarily for HI and pulsar surveys. With other Australian and overseas
> antennas, the ATNF telescopes operate as a VLBI array which uses the
> broad-band S2 recording system. The Headquarters site is shared with CSIRO
> Telecommunications and Industrial Physics (formerly CSIRO Radiophysics)
and
> the Anglo-Australian Observatory, which operates the 4m Anglo-Australian
> and Schmidt optical telescopes near Coonabarabran.
