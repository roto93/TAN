Subject: Deadline for IAU Symposia and Colloquia Proposals




Dear All,

Happy New year to all of you ! 

I'm sending  you this  email as new  president (2000-2003) of  the IAU
Commission 37  "Star Clusters  and Association". I  call to  mind that
both Commission 33 "Structure and Dynamics of the Galactic System" and
Commission  37 "Star  Clusters  and Associations"  constitute the  IAU
Division  VII "Galactic  System".  It  so happens  that  I'm currently
president (2000-2003) of both Commission 37 and Division VII.

Quite a  few members of Commission  37 have not provided  the IAU with
their  email  addresses, or  failed  to  communicate  their new  email
addresses.    They  can   easily  do   so   via  the   IAU  web   site
(http://www.iau.org).  In the mean time, in order to reach immediately
a reasonably large  number of people interested in  "Star Clusters and
Associations", I'm  sending this  message to a  slightly large  set of
people, hoping  that most  members of the  IAU Commission 37  will be,
directly or indirectly,  reached by this email.  Feel  free to forward
it to anybody potentially interested in its content. I apologize if it
is only a disturbance to you and/or if you receive it twice.

The main  purpose of this  message is to  bring to your  attention the
approaching deadline for the  submission of proposals for IAU symposia
and IAU colloquia in 2002, and  letters of intent for IAU symposia and
JDs during the General Assembly in Sydney in 2003. This early deadline
for letters of  intent for the GA 2003 is necessary  in order to allow
the GA organizers to make reservations for ample meeting facilities in
Sydney.

Any proposal should  be submitted to me by 15 March  2001.  It will be
my task, as  the President of the IAU  Division VII "Galactic System",
to organize the endorsement process of your proposals by this division
but it is your responsibility to contact any other division/commission
if you are interested in their endorsement.

For further details, the potential proposers are kindly asked to check
the  following IAU  web site  for information  related to  IAU meeting
proposals (http://www.iau.org/deadline.html).

Proposers of  larger meetings in 2003,  not to be held  in Sydney, are
strongly encouraged to avoid  potential conflicts with the IAU General
Assembly meetings,  since IAU will not sponsor  colloquia and symposia
taking  place in  the half  year period  centered on  the time  of the
General Assembly in Sydney (July 2003).

I look forward to seeing a large number of excellent proposals for IAU
symposia and colloquia.

Yours sincerely,

Georges Meylan
President  IAU  Commission  #37
"Star Clusters and Association"
