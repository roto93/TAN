Subject: International conference on quantum computation in Sigapore


> We are organizing a pedagogical workshop on quantum computation and
> information in Singapore, the International Workshop on Quantum
> Information and Computation  from 2 april 2001-6 April 2001.
>
> Purpose of Workshop
>
> Quantum Computation is an active emerging interdisciplinary research
> frontier that has generated a great deal of interest and stimulated novel
> potential applications in the last five years.  It is presently one of the
> most viable and potentially feasible avenue in which mankind can overcome
> the inherent barrier posed by the rapid miniaturisation of microchip
> components. This workshop also serves as a means of discussing new ideas
> and trends in quantum computations in the next few years. The objectives
> of the workshop are To provide good pedagogical and introductory courses
> for researchers and graduate students on quantum information and
> computation To promote exchanges of scientific knowledge in quantum
> computation To enhance the interactions of scientists working in this area
> within the region
>
> Highlights of the Workshop
>
> Invited lectures: Keynote pedagogical lectures by distinguished speakers
> on quantum computation and information. Tentatively, the list of speakers
> is as follows:
>
> Prof. C. Bennett (IBM, USA)
> Prof. G. Casati (Como, Italy)
> Prof. A. Ekert (Oxford, UK)
> Prof. S. Popescu (Bristol, UK)
> and others
>
>
> For more details and weekly updates please visit our website:
> http://www.physics.nus.edu.sg/~phyohch/workshop
>
> Major Topics
>
> Quantum algorithms; Information theory; Quantum communication; Fault
> tolerant computation; Quantum error correction; Experimental realization;
> Measurement theory; interpretations of quantum mechanics; Hidden variables
> and issues related to contextuality; Quantum chaos and decoherence
>
>
>
> Registration and Accommodation
>
> The registration fee for the workshop will be US$100.  Limited
> accommodation at the university visitor lodge at S$70.00 per night (S$1.75
> =3D US$1.00) is available if the participant books at least two months
prior
> to the workshop.
