I am pleased to announce that Prof. Sun Kwok of University Calgary, Canada
and Prof. Howard Yee of University of Toronto, Canada agreed to give an
intensive short course on "Recent Advances in Optical/infrared Astronomy" 
during this coming winter break, starting from Feb.5 to Feb.8, 2001.  This
course intends to be a one-credit course, lasting for 18 hours, and 
targets at students who have some basic knowledge of astronomy but who 
have had more advanced physics courses, such as electromagnetism, 
thermodynamics, etc.  The level of students ranges from senior 
under-graduate students to graduate students.

The contents of this course cover from the basic radiation processes to
the recent advances in observations of optical/infrared astronomy. 
Especially the second half of the course will be devoted to the research
topics of most current interests.  This is a very rare opportunity for
students in Taiwan to be exposed to such high-level lectures in organized
series.  The course content will be listed in the webpage of the Physics
Department, Taiwan University:

www.phys.ntu.edu.tw 

The course listing will begin to become effective from Jan.5, 2001 on.

The lectures will be held in the new Physics/Center of Condensed Matter
building of Taiwan University, next to the new Gymnasium.  The language
of this course is English. 

Students who attend the lectures are strongly encouraged to take the course,
but non-students, such as postdocs and faculty members, are allowed to 
audit the lectures.  At the end of the course, there will be a 
official certificate from Taiwan University given to the students who 
complete the course.  The certificate allows the students to request one 
credit from their respective universities.  (This matter is under 
negotiation with the university authorities, where most students are
expected to attend.)  

The registration for this course is conducted through the e-mail.
There is no fixed form for the registration.  When you email to us
to register, you should indicate in the mail the following items:

(1) Your name.

(2) What level of study you are currently under, such as 4th-year 
undergraduate in physics.

(3) What university you are in.

(4) What your average grade is in either of the last two semesters (the 
    semester before the summer of 2000 or during the fall of 2000).     

Because our computer is under the Linux system, your registration letter
should be in plain text and DO NOT include anything that is specific to
the Microsoft. 


We envision that the maximum number of students is about 
40. The deadline for registration is the 31st Jan. 2001.
The registration email address is:

astro@aspvm9.phys.ntu.edu.tw 

We are looking forward hearing from you, and if you are a faculty member,
please let your students know about this course.

Professor of Physics, Taiwan University
