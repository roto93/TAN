> Dear Colleagues,
>
>    We are very pleased to announce an international workshop on "Mass-
> losing Pulsating Stars and Their Circumstellar Matter" to be held in
> Sendai, Japan, on May 13-16, 2002.
>    The purpose of this First Announcement is  to  supply some general
> information about the conference and to invite all interested colleagues
> to participate in this workshop.
>
>    If you are interested in attending the workshop, please visit
>      http://www.astr.tohoku.ac.jp/ws2002/
> and return the on-line PRE-Registration FORM attached in the site to
>      wsloc@astr.tohoku.ac.jp
> by OCTOBER 1, 2001.
>   We  will send out the second announcement by the end of DECEMBER 2001,
> which will include details about the conference venue, hotels, program
> and a list of invited speakers.
>    The workshop proceedings will be published soon after the conference.

> SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE
>    New observational technology has revealed  many unexpected views of
> astronomical objects.  This  is especially true in the field  of  the
> stellar astrophysics.   Large-scale optical and near infrared surveys
> and  the  radio observations  of  maser sources have given  many  new
> insights about mass-losing pulsating stars.  In  Japan, a net work of
> VLBI,  the VERA project,  was recently funded.  The VERA will be used
> to measure the accurate positions of many AGB maser sources.
>    In spite of these new observational discoveries, however,  some old
> and fundamental problems like  the  role  of the stellar pulsation in
> mass-loss process still remain unresolved.
>    Our workshop is planned to confront the new observational facts with
> the theoretical results.  Implications of the new photometric studies
> and  the high precision interferometric measurements of radio objects
> will be fully discussed.
>    Since the AGB stars are often the brightest stars in the Galaxy, the
> study of these stars will be also useful to investigate the structure
> of the Galaxy and the mass distribution in nearby galaxies.
>    The purpose of this workshop is not only  to  develop  the  stellar
> physics but also to study the structure and history of galaxies.
>
>
> SCIENTIFIC SESSIONS
>    Recent results of massive photometry projects
>    Pulsation and properties of mass-losing stars
>    Optical or IR observations of circumstellar matter
>    Radio and mm observations of circumstellar matter
>    Distribution of maser sources in the Galaxy
>    VERA and other future projects
>

> SCIENTIFIC ORGANIZING COMMITTEE
>    S.H. Cho(Korea), S. Deguchi(Japan), K.Y. Lo(China R), Y. Muraki
>    (Japan), Y. Nakada(Japan), M.J. Reid(USA), T. Sasao(Japan),
>    M. Takeuti(Japan, chair), H.J. van Langevelde(The Netherlands),
>    C. Waelkens(Belgium), P.A. Whitelock(South Africa), A. Winnberg

> LOCATION
>    The workshop will be held at the International Conference Room in
> the Saito Ho-on Kaikan Hall just at the center of Sendai, a local
> capital of the North East province of Honshu Island, Japan.
>    Sendai was founded four hundred years ago by a famous and ambitious
> daimyo but now is a peaceful city with one-million population.
> The scenic bay of Matsushima is within a half hour travel by train.
> Although our guests in May will not be able to enjoy the famous cherry
> blossoms of Sendai, other beautiful flowers and fresh  green leaves
> will welcome them.
>    We believe the participants will enjoy their scientific discussions
> in a pleasant atmosphere.
>
>
> TRANSPORTATION TO SENDAI
>    Sendai International Airport keeps airlines with Korea and China, and
> some islands in the Pacific Ocean,  but  has  not services with other
> countries. People from the other foreign countries are recommended to
> arrive at Tokyo/Narita International Airport. The most convenient route
> to Sendai from Tokyo is the Shinkansen, a super-express. It will take
> two hours from Tokyo or Ueno railway station to Sendai railway station.
>    The site of conference can be reached within a ten-minute walk from
> Sendai railway station.
>
>
> ACCOMMODATION
>    There are many hotels in Sendai from deluxe hotels for the Imperial
> Family to less expensive ones for business travellers. We shall show
> a list of recommended hotels close to the conference site in the second
> announcement.
>    The LOC will reserve rooms for the participants upon request.
>
>    For more information about Sendai, visit the following web pages:
>      http://www.siip.city.sendai.jp/kankokoryu/english/
> and
>      http://v-sendai.comminet.or.jp/~sendaicb/index_e.html
>
>
> TOUR
>    We plan to organize a one-day tour to visit the Mizusawa Observatory
> where we can study the exhibition on the old latitude observations and
> the brand new radio telescope for the high precision measurement.  On
> the way back to Sendai, we shall have chance to visit the famous scenic
> bay, Matsushima.
>
>
> REGISTRATION FEE
>    Participant: 100 USD for the payment before 1st of March 2002;130 USD
> for late payment. Registered participants will receive one free copy of
> the proceedings.
>    Registered guest: 30 USD. Registered guests will enter freely the
> conference site and enjoy the break time together with the participants.
>
>
> FINANCIAL SUPPORT
>    The LOC plans the financial support to a limited number of
participants.
> The policy will be informed in the second announcement.
