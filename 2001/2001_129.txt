for

>
>    Science Working Group
>    Array configuration, artificial-sky simulations
>    Correlator design
>    Station antenna and beam-forming design
>    Interference mitigation techniques
>    Site evaluation and selection
>
> Both oral presentations and posters will be accommodated.  We are
> particularly interested in hearing about on-going scientific programs that
> will be significantly enhanced or transformed by the capabilities of the
SKA,
> and the key scientific requirement for doing that.  We are also eager to
hear
> about the technological progress that has been made since the last meeting
in
> August 2000.
>
> Please go to http://www.skatelescope.org/meeting for on-line registration

program
> and information regarding hotel accommodations, pre and post conference
> tours, and instructions on how to get to the meeting venue from local area
> airports.
>
> If you haven't already done so - book your room now! (Weddings at the
> Bancroft Hotel immediately before and after the SKA meeting, are adding a
> little confusion, but the Durant Hotel has enough rooms, and is only about
a
> block away.) Note that the conference rate is only guaranteed for booking
by
> 6/9. Less expensive housing is available through the University, and can
be
> accessed via the meeting web site.  Berkeley is a popular destination in
the
> summer, so book your room without delay.
>
> We are looking forward to this meeting and your participation therein.
>
> Sincerely,
> Jill Tarter for the Local Organizing Committee
