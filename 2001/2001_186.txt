                 Title:   Instabilities and Clumping 
                          in Type Ia Supernova Remnants
             
                 Abstract:

            We present two-dimensional high-resolution hydrodynamical
            simulations in spherical polar coordinates of a Type Ia
            supernova interacting with a constant density interstellar
            medium. The ejecta are assumed to be freely expanding with 
            an exponential density profile. The interaction gives rise 
            to a double-shocked structure susceptible to hydrodynamic
            instabilities. 

            The Rayleigh-Taylor instability initially grows, but the
            Kelvin-Helmholtz instability takes over, producing vortex
            rings. Provided the simulation is initiated early in the
            evolution, with a perturbation $\ga 1$\%, the instability 
            reaches its fully developed nonlinear strength within 5
            doubling times. The further nonlinear evolution does not
            depend on the initial conditions. Considering the small
            initial radii of Type Ia supernovae, they are likely to reach
            this fully developed phase. The nonlinear
            instability initially evolves toward longer wavelengths and
            eventually fades away when the reverse shock front is in the
            flatter part of the supernova density distribution. Based on
            observations of  X-ray knots and the protrusion in the
            southeast outline of Tycho's supernova remnant, we include
            clumping in the ejecta because these features cannot be
            explained by instabilities growing from small
            perturbations. The clump interaction with the reverse shock
            induces Rayleigh-Taylor and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities on
            the clump surface that facilitate fragmentation. 

            In order to survive crushing and to
            have a bulging effect on the forward shock, the clump's
            initial density ratio to the surrounding ejecta must be at
            least 100 for the conditions in Tycho's remnant. The $^{56}$Ni
            bubble effect may be important for the development of
            clumpiness in the ejecta.

            The observed presence of an Fe clump would then require a
            non-radioactive origin for this Fe, possibly $^{54}$Fe. The
            large radial distance of the X-ray emitting Si and S ejecta
            from the remnant center indicates that they were initially in
            clumps.
