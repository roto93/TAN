> Title: "The Heisenberg pyrochlore antiferromagnet: a classical spin
>         liquid"
>
> Abstact:
> The results of the current systematic experimental investigation of highly
> frustrated magnets, in particular of a series of rare-earth magnets on the
> pyrochlore lattice, has underlined the need for a detailed theory of
> geometric frustration. To provide both an understanding of the common
> features of these magnets and a basis for the inclusion of perturbations,
> we study a classical antiferromagnet on the pyrochlore lattice, which has
> a large ground-state degeneracy and behaves quite unlike conventional
> unfrustrated or disordered magnets. We discuss the magnet's ground-state
> properties as well as the effect of two experimentally important
> perturbations, namely low-temperature thermal fluctuations and dilution
> with nonmagnetic ions.
>
> We show that the magnet is a classical spin liquid: its correlations are
> short-ranged in both space and time at all temperatures; there is no
> ordering or freezing. In particular, we calculate its spin autocorrelation
> function and develop a method for determining whether thermal fluctuations
> lift the ground-state degeneracy. We find an explicit expression for the
> magnetic susceptibility at all temperatures, for pure and weakly diluted
> systems.  This provides a microscopic basis for a phenomenological model
> recently proposed for the dilution-dependence of the susceptibility. Our
> result is close to a Curie-Weiss law down to a temperature well below the
> mean-field ordering temperature; this feature is known experimentally as
> the fingerprint of strong geometric frustration.

> Title: "Quantum Hall Physics in High Landau Levels - Stripes and Bubbles"
>
> Abstract:
> Two-dimensional electron systems in a strong magnetic field display very
> rich behaviour: as disorder or interactions lift the degeneracy of the
> lowest Landau level, one finds the quantum Hall effects, skyrmions,
> composite fermions and much more.
>
> This talk addresses the question which correlated electron states exist in
> high Landau levels. It turns out to be possible to derive a number of
> exact results in this regime. One finds that the electrons form
> charge-density waves in the form of 'stripes' or 'bubbles', whereas the
> fractional quantum Hall effect is absent. A number of recent experiments,
> as well as numerical work, confirming these results are also discussed.
