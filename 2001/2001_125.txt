                     The 8th Taipei Astrophysics Workshop

    "AMiBA 2001: High-z Clusters, Missing Baryons, and CMB Polarization"
                   Taipei & Hualien, Taiwan 11-15 June 2001

The 8th Taipei Astrophysics Workshop (TAW8) are jointly organized by the
National Taiwan University and Academia Sinica, and sponsored by the
National Science Council ROC and the Ministry of Education ROC.  

The goal of this workshop is to find out the latest development and
future plans of detecting CMB polarization and surveys for
clusters/missing baryons, and other complementary observations and theoretical
works.  

The workshop will be held at 2 sites, the National Taiwan University in
Taipei for the first 2 days 11-12/June, and the Taroko National Park on
the East Coast of Taiwan for the second part of the workshop from 13 June

	AMiBA is a 19-element interferometer array, a dedicated 
	telescope built to search for high-z clusters of galaxies 
	via the Sunyaev-Zeldovich Effect, with full polarization
	capabilities for detecting CMB polarization.  

	It is part of the Taiwan CosPA project.
