> [Purpose of the meeting]
> 
>     "Numerical Simulations in Astronomy 2002 (NSA2002)" is aimed
> at summarizing latest numerical simulations in astrophysics.  
> It is held as a satellite meeting of the IAU 8th Asian-Pacific
> Regional Meeting (APRM2002).  Those who attend NSA2002 are assumed
> to attend also APRM2002.  Those who are interested in NSA2002
> are recommended strongly to visit the web page of APRM2002,
> URL is http://www.astro.isas.ac.jp/conference/aprm2002/ and register
> yourself as soon as possible.  All the information on the conference 
> site, travel, visa, and local area will be given there.  The LOC of 
> this satellite meeting covers only the talks given in the satellite 
> meeting.
> 
> 
> [Style of the meeting]
> 
>     "Numerical Simulations in Astronomy 2002" is interdisciplinary 
> in the sense that it is not intended to focus on any specific 
> astronomical object.  It consists of about 10 invited talks and another
> 10 contributed talks.  Each invited talk summarizes recent advance in 
> a specific theme.   It is 30 minutes long and will be followed by 10
> minutes discussion.  Each contributed talk features recent interesting 
> numerical simulations  and technics which bring us new findings in 
> astronomy and astrophysics.  It is 15 minutes long and will be followed
> by 5 minutes discussion.   Those who wish to present poster papers 
> are recommended to submit them to the main conference.   We do NOT have
> a poster session in this satellite meeting.
