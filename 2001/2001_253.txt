              Room 716, Condensed Matter Science and Physics Building
                                Taida Campus
                   (Corner of Hsin-Hi Rd. & Hsin-Sun South Rd.)

             Time: AM 09:30-12:00

            All graduate students interested in conducting optical/IR
astronomical research are invited. Each speaker will give a 15-20 minutes
informal talk on what projects in their research activities interested and
capable graduate students will be welcome to take part and hopefully develop
into thesis research.  The remaining time will be devoted to questions and
discussions.

Note: Dr. Luis Ho has sent some material for interested students to browse.
These are displayed in ASIAA's library, please check with the librarian.
