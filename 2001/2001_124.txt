            Title: Infrared Spectroscopy of Solid Interstellar Matter
            
            
            Abstract: Infrared spectroscopy is the only tool to assess in-situ 
the physical and chemical nature of solid interstellar matter. In the
ultraviolet and visible, interstellar grains do scatter light. In the
infrared, pure absorption dominates and, interestingly enough, grains are
transparent to their own radiation. Thus absorption spectroscopy, in the
vibrational range of the spectrum, can give access to the chemical
composition of the grains. However, infrared spectroscopy in Astronomy is at
its infancy, mostly because interstellar objects are very faint and the
Earth's atmosphere blocks most of the spectroscopic information. A few years
ago, ISO, the European satellite of infrared astronomy has revolutionnized
the field by allowing observations between 2.5 and 180 microns with a
resolution well adapted to the study of solid state features. I will present
a few results pertaining to the composition of interstellar ices and
silicates. I will also emphasize how experimental approaches, based on
laboratory simulations makes it possible to simulate the evolution of grains
in the interstellar medium and understand the role that these grains may
play in the chemical evolution of our Galaxy.
