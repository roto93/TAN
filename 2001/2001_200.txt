The Eighth Summer School in Synthesis Imaging will take place from
June 18 (Tuesday) through June 25 (Tuesday) of 2002.  The summer
school will be hosted by the National Radio Astronomy Observatory
(NRAO) and by the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology and
held in the Workman center on the Tech campus in Socorro, New Mexico.
Data reduction tutorials on June 21 at the Array Operations Center
(AOC) will allow attendees to get "hands-on" experience with data
calibration and imaging for both VLA and VLBA data.  NRAO scientific
staff will be available at the AOC to aid and advise participants.  A
tour of the VLA site will be given on June 23.

The Summer School will cover all basic aspects of radio
interferometry, including both connected element (e.g. the VLA) and
Very Long Baseline interferometers (e.g. the VLBA).  Lectures will be
given by the NRAO staff, faculty from New Mexico Tech, Caltech, and by
staff members of other observatories.  The range of subjects will be
similar to past Summer Schools, and can be reviewed by consulting
"Synthesis Imaging in Radio Astronomy II", the published collection of
lectures from the 6th NRAO Synthesis Imaging Summer School (ASP
Conference Series, Volume 180, 1999).  The lectures will be given at a
level appropriate for graduate students in astrophysics.  There will
be ample time for questions and discussion following each lecture and
at the end of each day.  The registration fee will include a copy of
the book in the registration package.

There will be a limit on attendance of 150 people.  A fee of $120 will
be assessed, sufficient only to cover our local expenses and a copy of
Vol. 180.  We are investigating the possibility of providing some
financial assistance.  Details about eligibility and the application
process for financial assistance will be described in the second
announcement.  The registration fee will include transportation to and
from the Albuquerque airport on June 17, and on June 25 or 26, daily
transportation to/from hotels, and a tour of the VLA on June 23.  A
summer school dinner, held outdoors on the New Mexico Tech Campus on
Thursday evening is also included in the registration fee, as is a
cookout at Water Canyon on Saturday, June 22.

Rooms will be blocked out at Socorro motels for the school, and
information on these motels will be sent to participants in a general
mailing in February of 2002.  The daily cost of a single currently
ranges from $37-$77 and sharing a double from $22-$40 per person
including tax.  Motel registration will be the responsibility of the
attendees.

To indicate your interest in attending the summer school, please
pre-register electronically by directing your web browser to
http://www.aoc.nrao.edu/~gtaylor/synth02/synth02.html, and following
the directions for electronic pre-registration.  More information
about the meeting, lectures, and the town of Socorro is available from
the web page.
