Dear Colleagues,

It is with deep regret that I have to tell you of sad news about Peter,
who died at home on Sunday after a long illness.  His wife Jane and
daughter Suzi were with him.  Peter was one of the founder members of the
Radio Astronomy group here, joining in 1951.  He was a wonderful source of
knowledge and inspiration for all those who worked here.  We all feel
privileged to have had him as a colleague and will greatly miss his
tremendous insight into all aspects of our subject, together with his
penetrating questions and comments, always delivered with modesty and
humour.

Yours sincerely
  Richard Hills
