>   Central University, Chung-li, Taiwan.
>
>   The program consists of lectures and contributed talks.  The lectures
>   include introductions and current status to supersymmetry topics while
>   the contributed talks are mainly on current topics. All talks are
>   plenary.
>
>
>   *Interested participants are welcomed to give contributed talks(of
>    about 20-30 mins), which we will try to accomodate within the limit of
>    our schedule.

>  The invited lectures
>  ---------------------
>
>  * Pran Nath (Northeastern U.):Supersymmetry and Unification
>    The lectures will cover  soft SUSY breaking, CP violation, dark
>    matter, gauge unification, extra dimensions and string/brane models.
>    I also plan to discuss  g-2, edms, bsgamma, b-tau unification and
>    proton decay.
>
>  * Kaoru Hagiwara (KEK):Precision Measurements vs Supersymmetric
>                         Standard Model
>    The lectures will cover all relevant precision measurements including
>    the electroweak ones on Z and W, muon g-2, EDM's, Atomic Parity
>    Violation, and the recent NuTeV results on low-energy neutral currents.
>
>  * Jonathan Feng (MIT and UC-Irvine):Supersymmetry Breaking an Mediation
>    The lectures will cover various aspects of supersymmetry, supersymmetry
>    breaking mechanisms and mediation approaches.
>
>  * Miao Li (NTU):Supersymmetry and Supergravity
>    An introductory lecture on supersymmetry or supergravity in string
>    theory.
