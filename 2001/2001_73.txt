> Dear Colleague:

> An international conference on "Disks of Galaxies" will take
> place in Puebla, Mexico, November 5-9, 2001.
>
> The purpose of this First Announcement is to bring the meeting
> to the attention of astronomers, and to solicit expressions of
> interest in attending. This First Announcement contains the
> preliminary registration form, and some relevant information.

> Disks are probably the flattest subsystems of galaxies,
> and their formation and evolution pose interesting problems.
> How do they form, evolve and decouple from the other galaxy
> subsystems, such as the halo and the bulge, in the process of
> building a galaxy? Today there are numerous indications of
> the dynamical evolution of disk galaxies, through various
> secular or episodic processes, such as bar formation and
> destruction, bulge growth and mergers, sometimes over periods
> much shorter than the standard galaxy age of 10-15 Gyrs.
>
> Disks develop many sub-structures, either internally, both
> spontaneously via instabilities and due to the interplay
> with other components of the same galaxy, or externally, by
> interactions with other galaxies. In the latter case the
> fragility of the disk structure poses already interesting
> constraints on the amount of interaction which can be
> tolerated.  The sub-structures include bars, spirals, rings
> and warps, each presenting interesting dynamical problems on
> their own.
>
> Disks extend from the most central to the relatively outer
> parts of each galaxy, permitting the study of the kinematics
> and dynamics of the major part of a spiral galaxy using a
> variety of tracers.  Since disks are quite responsive they
> allow us to probe the different environments in which they
> reside, from the black hole in their innermost parts, to the
> halo that surrounds them. The importance of the HI layer to
> test dark matter is well established, and the connection of
> the HI and H_2 with the stellar disk yields clues about the
> history of star formation in disks.
>
> Resonances play a crucial role in the dynamics of disks and
> it is thus important to locate the main resonant regions.
> For this, many photometrical and spectroscopical methods
> have been proposed so far to detect them, but none of them
> can be applied easily in a systematic way to large samples
> of galaxies. Hence we still have not reached a global picture
> concerning their importance.
>
> Star formation is occurring actively in the disk of galaxies.
> The presence of fresh gas and dust allows new stars to form,
> sometimes in an organized way due to the response to density
> wave perturbations in the old disk population. This process
> can at present be studied with IR-imaging facilities as well
> as in the classical optical bands.
