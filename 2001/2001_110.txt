Dear Colleagues,

Thanks to Xiao Gang for forwarding us an extermely interesting press
article on the state of affairs of the cosmological constant and its
implication to string theory. As you will see from my message to Xiao
Gang appended below, string theory now is facing, as never had before,
an experimental confrontation which I take as an exciting positive
input, that is, we perhaps need to change or improve our rules of thumbs
in string theory.

Hi Xiao Gang,

Thanks for forwarding me the exciting message you got from the press.
Unfortunately I didn't see you today. In case you haven't replied to
this inquiry, I want to make a suggestion that you might want to
take into account when you reply.

The statement that a future horizon of our universe is in confliction
with string theory is an over-statement. It is true that with our
current understanding of string theory, we don't yet know the mechanism
for having a finite dimensional Hilbert space. This problem, in a way,
is quite similar to the black hole problem. In this latter problem,
it is widely believed that the finite entropy of a black hole can be
in principle understood in string theory. This is to say that there are
as many quantum states corresponding to the black hole as required
by the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Now if the universe will accelerate
forever, it is like that we all live inside a black hole, and surely
the number of states available to us should be as predicted by
the entropy formula.

As I stressed to you repeatedly that now, if the observational results
will survive, it is time for string theory to confront experiment!
String theory will be turned into real science from ``theology" 
since it can be falsified.

Miao
