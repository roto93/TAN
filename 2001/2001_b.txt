 1.  NRC ORGANIZATION COMMITTEE SEEKS INPUT

1.  NRC ORGANIZATION COMMITTEE SEEKS INPUT
 
The NRC Committee on Organization and Management of
Research in Astronomy and Astrophysics (formerly known as 
the Blue Ribbon Panel) has begun its deliberations on 

1) the organizational effectiveness of Federal support of
astronomical sciences; 

2) the advantage and disadvantages of transferring NSF's 
astronomy responsibilities to NASA; and 

3) other options for addressing the management and 
organizational issues identified by the committee and by 
recent NRC reports. 

The committee needs to hear the views of all of us, and 
seeks input by its next meeting, 12 July 2001. Please send 
your thoughts and ideas to mailto:comraa@nas.edu.

2.  HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE CYCLE 11 CALL FOR PROPOSALS

NASA and The Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) are 
pleased to announce the Cycle 11 Call for Proposals for 
Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Observations, Archival Research 
and Theoretical Research. Participation in this program is 
open to all categories of organizations, both domestic and 
foreign, including educational institutions, profit and 
nonprofit organizations, NASA Centers, and other Government 
agencies. This solicitation will be open from 11 June 2001 
through 7 September 2001 8:00pm EDT, and proposals may be
submitted throughout this period. Results of the selection 
will be announced in December 2001.

All programmatic and technical information, as well as 
specific guidelines for proposal preparation, are available 
electronically from the STScI World-Wide Web site at the 
Announcement Web Page with URL:

3.  DEMONSTRATION SCIENCE AT THE GEMINI TELESCOPES
    By Phil Puxley and Caty Pilachowski

The International Gemini Observatory announces the opportunity
to propose for Demonstration Science observations with visiting
instruments during the 2001B semester.  The Demonstration
Science program will pursue three separate scientific themes,
one each using FLAMINGOS I (a near-IR multi-object spectrograph
and imager on Gemini South), Phoenix (a near-IR high resolution
spectrograph on Gemini South) and CIRPASS (a near-IR integral
field unit spectrograph on Gemini North).  Each theme will be
allocated about 1 week of telescope time.

Selection of the Demonstration Science themes and definition
of the Demo Science teams (which may be drawn across multiple
proposing teams and individuals) will be by Gemini Observatory
together with the Gemini National Project Scientists.  Each
team will be led by a member of the Gemini scientific staff.

Letters of Interest for participation in the Demonstration
Science program should be submitted by e-mail directly to Gemini
(mailto:demoscience@gemini.edu).  The deadline for Letters of 
Interest is 15 July 2001.

For further information on the Demonstration Science Program and
Gemini instruments, see the Gemini website at 

        http://www.gemini.edu.
