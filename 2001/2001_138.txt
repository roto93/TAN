> 
> The international Heidelberg conference on ``Dark Matter in Astro
> and Particle Physics'' is a well-established interdisciplinary
> biennial conference that brings together renowned scientists working
> in fields of cosmology, astrophysics, particle and nuclear physics.
> The aim of this conference is to discuss and unravel the fascinating
> and tantalizing mysteries of the nature and origin of dark matter and
> dark energy which dominate our Universe.
> 
> The first three conferences took place in 1996, 1998 and 2000 in
> Heidelberg (Germany) which gave the conference its name and fame.
> DARK 2002 will thus be the first meeting within this series outside
> Europe. It will take place at the Graduate School of Business on the
> Breakwater Campus of the University of Cape Town at the Victoria and
> Alfred Waterfront, Cape Town, which is a prime South African tourist
> attraction. Arrival date is Sunday, 3 February 2002 and departure 
> date, Sunday, 10 February 2002.
> 
> We would like to cordially invite you to attend and participate in
> this conference on this fast-growing and exciting research field at
> the intersection of cosmology, astrophysics, nuclear and particle
> physics. You will find up-to-date information about the conference
> on our website (address given below).
