Intergalactic Organizing Committee
==================================

         M Bucher, SW Hawking, F Quevedo, N Turok 

This conference is made possible through the generous support
of Mr Dennis S Avery. 


CONFERENCE DESCRIPTION
======================

Several exciting recent developments attempting to connect string 
theory and supergravity to cosmology have taken place in the last
few years. Now seems an opportune moment to bring researchers together 
to assess and to develop these proposals, and hopefully to catalyze new 
developments. This conference is intended to provide a review and 
a forum for discussion of these new developments by bringing together
leading researchers in string/M Theory and in cosmology. 

There is room for approximately 100 participants. The conference will
be held at the new Centre for Mathematical Sciences (CMS), which eventually
will house the entire Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical
Physics (DAMTP) and the Department of Pure Maths and Mathematical Statistics
(DPMMS). At present three of the five pavilions, one of which now houses
the DAMTP Relativity and High Energy groups, and a central core 
where the conference sessions will be held, are fully completed and
operational.   The conference will be held in the lecture theatres in the
CMS central core.

A welcoming wine and cheese reception will be held on the evening of
Monday, 20 August. The conference proper will begin Tuesday morning,
21 August and will end sometime during the afternoon of Saturday, 25
August. 

LODGING AND REGISTRATION
========================

Lodging for participants has been arranged at Selwyn College, one of
the 31 Colleges belonging to the University of Cambridge. Located near the 
heart of Cambridge, Selwyn College is approximately 1/2 mile from the 
Centre for Mathematical Sciences. The lodging consists of single person
rooms in the student dormitories of Selwyn College. Participants wishing
to stay in a hotel instead should contact the organizers to inquire
about possibilities. The #250 pound conference package 
includes housing from the night of the Monday, 20 August through the night 
of Saturday, 25 August, inclusive, as well as the conference registration 
and the conference banquet. Breakfast is included both other meals are not. 

LOCATION 
========

Cambridge is located about a hour from London by train from the King's
Cross train station. Both the Stansted and Luton airports, accessible
from most major European cities, are within less than an hour from
Cambridge  by bus or by train. The other two London airports Heathrow and
Gatwick  airports are accessible by bus or by train but are slightly less
convenient.

financial support are advised to apply by 1 June 2001.
Payment of the registration fee is to be received before the 15 June.
