> We present a HST study of the metal-rich globular cluster NGC 6553

> the STIS broad-band LP magnitude against V$_{555}$ and I$_{814}$
> magnitudes for stars of known metallicity and absolute (visual)
> magnitude, for application to our study of LMC globular clusters.
> NGC 6553 has been shown in earlier studies to have a very unusual
> colour-magnitude diagram, so we also use our data to investigate
> the reddening, distance, luminosity function and structure of this
> cluster. We deduce a higher metallicity and smaller distance
> modulus than did some previous studies, but emphasise that very
> large patchy extinction on small angular scales prohibits accurate
> determination of the parameters of this cluster. The horizontal
> branch of NGC 6553 in ($V,V-I$) is tilted at an angle close to that
> of the reddening vector. We show that extinction does not, however,
> explain the tilt, which is presumably a metallicity effect. The
> colour-magnitude diagram shows an apparent second turnoff some
> 1.5 magnitudes fainter than that of the cluster. We show that
> this is most likely the background Galactic bulge: however, in that
> case, the colour-magnitude diagram of NGC 6553 is not a good match to
> that of the field bulge population. The cluster is probably more
> metal-rich than is the mean field bulge star.

> At the distance of NGC 5128 (3.6 $\pm$ 0.2 Mpc) it is possible to resolve
globular clusters
> with high resolution imaging from the ground, thus allowing the globular
cluster candidate selection primarily

globular clusters in
> NGC 5128 on VLT UT1+FORS1 images, including the faintest members
(M$_{\mbox{V}}$ $\sim$ -5) known to date in
> this galaxy as well as 5 previously known clusters.

luminosity function, spanning
> -10.1 $<$ M$_{\mbox{V}}$ $<$ -4.9 and -9.3 $<$ M$_{\mbox{U}}$ $<$ -3.3,
constructed.
> These are the deepest globular cluster luminosity functions in an
elliptical galaxy determined so far.
> The Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics show that the difference between the
globular cluster luminosity functions
> of NGC 5128 and the MW is not larger than the difference between the ones
of M31 and the MW.
> The (U-V)$_O$ color histogram shows a bimodal distribution.
>
> For 23 globular clusters I obtained K-band images with SOFI at the NTT in
La Silla. Their positions
> in the (U-V) vs. (V-K) color-color diagram indicate that they are indeed
old globular clusters.
> Assuming that the globular clusters in NGC 5128 span a similar age range
as the ones in the Milky Way

obtained

are

> pre-main-sequence stars in Orion on time scales of $\sim$ 1-36 days,
$\sim$ 2
> months, and $\sim$ 2 years. A total of 1235 near-infrared variable stars
are
> identified, $\sim$ 93\% of which are likely associated with the Orion~A
> molecular cloud. The variable stars exhibit a diversity of photometric
> behavior with time, including cyclic fluctuations with periods up to 15
days,
> aperiodic day-to-day fluctuations, eclipses, slow drifts in brightness
over
> one month or longer, colorless variability (within the noise limits of the
> data), stars that become redder as they fade, and stars that become bluer
as
> they fade. The mean peak-to-peak amplitudes of the photometric
fluctuations are
> $\sim$ 0.2$^{\rm m}$ in each band and 77\% of the variable stars have
color
> variations less than 0.05$^{\rm m}$. The more extreme stars in our sample
have
> amplitudes as large as $\sim$ 2$^{\rm m}$ and change in color by as much
as
> $\sim$ 1$^{\rm m}$. The typical time scale of the photometric fluctuations
is
> less than a few days, indicating that near-infrared variability results
> primarily from short term processes. We examine rotational modulation of
cool
> and hot star spots, variable obscuration from an inner circumstellar disk,
and
> changes in the mass accretion rate and other physical properties in a
> circumstellar disk as possible physical origins of the near-infrared
> variability. Cool spots alone can explain the observed variability
> characteristics in $\sim$ 56-77\% of the stars, while the properties of
the
> photometric fluctuations are more consistent with hot spots or extinction
> changes in at least 23\% of the stars, and with variations in the disk
mass
> accretion rate or inner disk radius in $\sim$ 1\% of our sample. However,
> differences between the details of the observations and the details of
> variability predicted by hot spot, extinction, and accretion disk models
> suggest either that another variability mechanism not considered here may
be
> operative, or that the observed variability represents the net results of
> several of these phenomena.  Analysis of the star count data indicates
that
> the Orion Nebula Cluster is part of a larger area of enhanced stellar
surface
> density which extends over a $0.4^\circ\times2.4^\circ$

> error, the presence of unresolved binary stars and a spread in
metallicity.
> In two clusters (King 7 and King 5) red
> giant clump is present. CMDs of the cluster Be 20 (which is oldest among
> the sample) show a horizontal branch which resembles the
> horizontal branch of the globular clusters. Similar feature has
> also been found in other old open clusters (e,g., M67, NGC 6971, BE 18 and
> AM-2).
>        Morphological features of the CMDs can be used to get the
> approximate age of the clusters. Various morphological features
> (e.g., turnoff point, red ginat clump etc) have been used by several
> authors (Phelps et al. 1994; Carraro \& Chiosi, 1994; Anthony-Twarog
> \& Twarog, 1985). We have proposed a colour index parameter (CIP) which
> is the difference in colour index $(B-V)$ of the BTO of the
> MS and BRGB. This parameter is useful for the clusters which have no
> noticeable red giant clump. In the above mentioned methods magnitude at
> turnoff point is used which is rather difficult to estimate, whereas
> the colour at the turnoff (CIP) is not much sensitive to the visual
> estimation, consequently CIP should give a better approximation of
> morphological age, where it can be applied.

>         The observed CMDs are compared with the theoretical
> evolutionary model given by VandenBerg (1985) and convective
> core overshooting model by  Bertelli et al. (1994).
> The quality of fit to the observed CMDs provides clues to decide whether
> the convective core overshooting approach should be preferred or not.
> In case of the clusters Be 64, Be 69, King~7 and King 5, there seems an

> the standard models of VandenBerg (1985). This discrepancy
> can be explained as a failure of the

clusters
> (Be 64, Be 69 and King 5) has a value that agree within error with the
Salpeter
> value, whereas King 7 and Be 20 show a steeper ($\Gamma$ = -2.02$\pm$
0.24) and
> almost a flat MF respectively. We find that the slope of the MF of two
> clusters (King 5 and King 7) changes significantly from the inner region
to the
> outer region, becoming steeper at larger radii. Dynamical relaxation time
> of the clusters under discussion is less than the age of the clusters
> which indicates that all of these clusters are dynamically relaxed. Thus
> observed mass segregation in three clusters can be attributed to the
> dynamical evolution of the clusters. The ratio of the clusters' present
> radius to the limiting radius, estimated from the relation given
> by King (1962), can be representated by a law of exponent. The data used
in
> the present study indicate that clusters under discussion need a minimum
> time of about 18$\pm$5 Gyr to attain their limiting radius.
> It is planned to use a large cluster sample to study the variation of
> the ratio of the clusters' present radius to the limiting radius.

>         A program to search variable stars in the clusters used in
> the present study was also carried out. A few variable stars and
> probable $\delta$ scuti variable stars in the aforementioned
> clusters are being reported for the first time.
> We plan to continue the monitoring of these suspected variables
> in future to learn more about the nature of these suspected variables.
