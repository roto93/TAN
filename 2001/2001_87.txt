Dear TANists,

After I forwarded my last email "Next mini-workshop on the study of
Variable stars based on SLT due in June" to TAN, I just realized that
the following email sent to me two weeks ago might be meant to be
distributed to TAN as well.  I feel sorry that if it's the case because
the workshop was held on Tuesday already.  Still, for your better
understanding of this event and other follow-up events, I decided to
forward it to TAN even though it was late.


Yi-Jehng
