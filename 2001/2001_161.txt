Dear Master students studying astronomy/astrophysics,

Dr. Naomi Hirano (asscoaite research astronomer at ASIAA) and myself
(associate research fellow at ASIAA) are looking for a master student 
who wants to work on Astronomy and Astrophysics with us. Our research 
area is particularly observational study of star and planet formation. 
We mainly use radio telescopes (both single-dish and interferometer) to 
observe star-forming regions. We are also involved into the Submillimeter 
Array  (SMA) project, which is under constraction at the top of Mauna Kea, 
Hawaii. Master students who are interested in observastions, data redection
and working on radio telescopes are welcome. Also, mater students, who have 
not decided projects for their mater thesis, are encouraged to contact us.

We will provide a NSC-based scholarship.
