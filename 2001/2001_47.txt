Subject: RFI Mitigation Workshop

Dear IAU Commission 40 Members,


as many of you may be aware already, IUCAF and the IAU Working Group on RFI Mitigation are organizing a workshop on RFI mitigation. Attached I send you the announcement, with the understanding that the agenda is still provisional and further contributions are welcome, as well as participants, who want to bring themselves up-to-date in this new and fast developing field of research. 

I apologize for the inconvenience, if this hits you repeatedly.

If you are interested, you may also check the IUCAF home page occasionally for updates of the announcement.


Kind regards,


Klaus Ruf

similar, however. We may preferentially book participants, arriving by
car, into Altes Treppchen, which provides car parking.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><u>Contributions:</u></b> If you haven=92t done so, already, please
inform me, if you plan to give a presentation of your work. The plan still
is, to put all contributions together as workshop proceedings.
<p><b><u>Support:</u></b> If you wish to attend but have difficulties to
find the necessary travel money in your institute or observatory, you may
apply for support from IUCAF.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><u>Workshop program: </u></b>The workshop aims at a fully sampled
picture of RFI avoidance and mitigation techniques used in radio astronomy,
a careful evaluation of these methods, and at laying the basis for solid
input into the world of radio spectrum management and regulation. So, the
workshop will bring together different communities and provide an excellent
opportunity to learn from each other. The provisional schedule is as follows
(the schedule will be updated regularly following your responses, so please
consult the IUCAF homepage occasionally):

<p><b><u>Organization of the workshop:</u> </b>The work shop will be=
 organized
at the Max-Planck-Institut fuer Radioastronomie in Bonn, Germany, by the
chairman of IUCAF with, hopefully, some local help. The topic of the work
shop is described below.
<p>This announcement will go out to some e-mail exploders like IUCAF, WP7D,
and to some groups or individuals, who I happen to know are working in
one of the RFI mitigation fields. If you are interested in the workshop,
send an email to IUCAF at:
<center>
<p>Klaus Ruf &lt;kruf@mpifr-bonn.mpg.de></center>

<p>and I will put you on the list. Please inform others, who you assume
are interested and may not yet be included.
<p><b><u>Contributions:</u></b> Please inform me, if you are prepared to
give a presentation of your related work. The plan is, to put all=
 contributions
together as workshop proceedings.
<p>After some initial responses I will start to outline a work shop program
and send it out together with a registration form.
<p><b><u>Support:</u></b> If you wish to attend but have difficulties to
find all of the necessary travel money in your institute or observatory,
you may apply for support from IUCAF. The available funds are limited,
so please negotiate hard at home first.

<p><b><u><font size=3D+2>RFI Mitigation</font></u></b></center>

<p><b>1.<u> Introduction:</u> </b>Radio astronomy critically depends on
the ability to observe at the limits of sensitivity, and that these limits
are not set by man-made interference.
<p>Tackling RFI is a two fold process:
<ol>
<li>
it involves regulatory work e.g. in the ITU-R,</li>

<li>
it is a technological challenge to make ourselves as immune as=
 possible.</li>
</ol>
These two processes are now beginning to merge, and it is high time they
do.
<p>Regulatory work has started early, in 1956 or so, when radio astronomy
was introduced into the radio regulations of the ITU, which led to a number
of frequency allocations as well as to a number of recommendations, dealing
with the living together with transmitting services in shared and=
 neighboring
frequency bands.
<p>Techniques to observe through interference have been known also for
a long time and are used in other radio services, but only more recently
have become a separate field of research within the radio astronomy=
 community.
The explosive growth of the use of radio will make protection measures
more and more necessary and possibly even an obligation.
<p><b>2. <u>The Regulatory Environment:</u> </b>Radio astronomy is a=
 recognized
radio service with a number of entries in the international table of=
 frequency
allocations. Some of these frequency bands are shared with transmitting
services, others are "exclusively passive". The co-existence with=
 transmitting
services, which normally employ signal strengths orders of magnitude higher
than faint cosmic signals, is regulated by the Radio Regulations of the
International Telecommunication Union, ITU, and a number of recommendations.
One of these recommendations, Rec. ITU-R RA 769, developed within the Radio
Communication Sector of ITU, contains threshold values, above which=
 transmitted
power or field strength from transmitters of active services within the
radio astronomy bands is considered interference. These threshold values
are calculated based on the sensitivity of radio telescopes and are=
 accordingly
low.
Radiocommunication services, especially new ones, which have to look for
new allocations in the already crowded spectrum, consider these threshold
limits they have to meet in our frequency bands as a heavy burden, and
we are hearing more and more often that this burden is also undue.
<p>The sensitivity of our equipment is beyond debate, and so is the weakness
of the sources we observe, but we are explained that techniques exist and
are employed by radiocommunication services, so-called "mitigation=
 techniques",
which are designed to ease co-existence, and we are told by telecom=
 regulators
and by other "active" spectrum users that such factors could apply to radio
astronomy as well.
<p><b>3.<u>RFI Suppression:</u></b> Several techniques have been developed
and employed by radio astronomers over the years to suppress RFI in=
 observational
data. They range from filters and radar blankers to null steering in=
 telescope
arrays, adaptive filtering, and, more recently, sophisticated mathematical
modeling using high speed digital signal processing. The results of some
of these developments are very encouraging, but the applicability is=
 generally
limited to certain types of instruments or observing programs. It may be
difficult, but necessary to explain that techniques, which are helpful
to recover spectral line observations from heavy interference, e.g. OH-lines
buried under GLONASS emissions, may not be useful to clean maps of polarized
continuum emission, or that radar blankers may screw up VLBI observations,
and little has been published so far on the successful suppression of=
 unrecognized,
low-level interference. Hence, the extent to which these techniques can
be used advantageously needs to be clarified, for our own as well as our
fellow radio services=92 understanding.
<p><b>4. <u>Purpose and perspective of the workshop:</u></b> The main=
 purpose
of the workshop is to bring together radio astronomy experts from all fields
of RFI suppression and make an inventory of what is going on where. The
evaluation of the different techniques shall be started and preliminary
conclusions put together.
<p>Mitigation techniques and mitigation factors have started to play a
role in the regulatory environment, because our competitors for spectrum
already argue that they can be added, in dB, to our interference threshold
limits. Working Party 7D (Radio Astronomy) of the ITU-R has therefore=
 proposed
a Study Question on the applicability of interference mitigation techniques
to the radio astronomy service. In order to answer this question, WP7D
needs input documents, which can be discussed and which may provide the
technical basis for an eventual later recommendation. IUCAF as a recognized
organization within ITU-R, dealing with radio astronomy and other scientific
radio services, is best suited to initiate the discussions and sum up the
conclusions for input to the ITU-R Working Party 7D.
<p>For follow-up discussions and evaluations, and for the production of
input to WP7D, an IUCAF Interference Mitigation Working Group shall be
set up during the workshop, which will continue to work mostly by e-mail
correspondence.
