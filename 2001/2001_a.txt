>It's a very big universe out there, and an astronomer's work is
>never done when it comes to simply counting and cataloging the
>sheer number of stars in the heavens.
>
>Completing a seven-year effort at digitizing and analyzing the
>entire sky for a second time, astronomers at the Space Telescope
>Science Institute (STScI) in Baltimore, MD, and the Osservatorio
>Astronomico di Torino, in Italy, are releasing the Guide Star
>Catalog-II (GSC-II). This new version, which replaces the historic
>1989 catalog, provides important information on nearly one-half
>billion stars -- over 20 times as many as the original Guide Star
>Catalog.

>The GSC-II consortium is dedicating the catalog to the memory of
>Dr. Barry M. Lasker, who passed away in February 1999. Dr. Lasker,
>one of the founders of the STScI, was directly responsible for the
>vision that led to the creation of the DSS and GSC projects that
>have greatly influenced and benefited modern observational astronomy.
>
>The Guide Star Catalog II is a joint project of the Space Telescope
>Science Institute and the Osservatorio Astronomico di Torino. The
>participation of the Osservatorio Astronomico di Torino was
>supported by the Italian Council for Research in Astronomy.
>Additional support was provided by the European Southern
>Observatory, the Space Telescope European Coordinating Facility,
>the International Gemini project, and the European Space Agency
>Astrophysics Division. The Space Telescope Science Institute
>(STScI) is operated by the Association of Universities for
>Research in Astronomy, Inc. (AURA), for NASA, under contract
>with the Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD.
>The Hubble Space Telescope is a project of international
>cooperation between NASA and the European Space
>Agency (ESA).
