>SEE WHAT NASA'S HUBBLE SEES, WITH THE CLICK OF A MOUSE
>
>Each day, NASA's Hubble Space Telescope collects enough
>information and images to fill five encyclopedias. Now, anyone with
>access to a computer and the World Wide Web can see the most
>exciting pictures captured by the world's first space-based optical
>telescope.
>
>A new web site, "Hubble Space Telescope: New Views of the
>Universe," highlights the unique contributions to astronomy by this
>tireless observatory. The exhibition was developed by the Space
>Telescope Science Institute (STScI), Baltimore, MD, in
>collaboration with the Smithsonian Institution.
>
>The new Internet portal seeks to simulate the experience of visiting
>the Smithsonian exhibition, which is now touring the country.
>Support for developing this exhibition was provided by NASA and
>the Lockheed-Martin Corporation.
>
>Since its launch in 1990, the orbiting Hubble Space Telescope has
>provided unprecedented views of the Universe. Using spectacular
>Hubble images, the exhibition and its companion web site take
>visitors on a fascinating exploration of Martian weather, colliding
>galaxies, the tumultuous life cycles of stars, very distant celestial
>objects, and even a comet colliding with Jupiter.
>
>The web site shares many of the physical exhibition's features, such
>as videos, a roadmap of how long the light from different objects in
>space takes to reach us here on Earth and virtual reality activities,
>which gives users a true hands-on experience of the orbiting observer.
>
>"Hubble Space Telescope: New Views of the Universe" is a special
>feature of HubbleSite, Hubble's official online home and the web's
>most comprehensive source of Hubble news, pictures, information,
>and educational resources. Both web sites were developed by
>STScI, which manages the science program for the Hubble Space
>Telescope and is operated by the Association of Universities for
>Research in Astronomy, Inc. for NASA, under contract with
>NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD.
>
>The Hubble Space Telescope is a project of international cooperation
>between NASA and the European Space Agency.
