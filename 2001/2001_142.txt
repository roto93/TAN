           Note 1: Thanks all the Journal Club speakers from both ASIAA
                   and NCU since last summer. You all did a good job !

           Note 2: Naomi (suggested by Jeremy) has very kindly agreed to
                   be the Chair of the Journal Club. There might be no
                   Journal Club on 20th July since she will be away.
                   We all shall continue to give her full support when
                   she restarts the Journal Club in August.
