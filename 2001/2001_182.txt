<< ABSTRACT >>

Magnetic fields are thought to play a significant role in all stages of
star formation.  However, there are few observations that measure magnetic
fields at the relevant scale for the star formation process. In this talk,
I will present the results from a survey of linear polarization in
molecular cores at 1.3 mm wavelength with the BIMA millimeter
interferometer.  The observations achieve angular resolution up to 2",
which is more than 5 times better than previous single-dish observations.  
The improvement in angular resolution allows me to investigate detailed
magnetic field morphology and obtain reliable values for the dispersion of
the polarization angles. The analysis in the dispersion of the
polarization angles further provides estimates for the magnetic field
strengths in the plane of sky, the upper limit of the mass-to-flux ratios,
and the turbulent to magnetic energy ratios.  I will discuss the
implications of my results for star formation.
