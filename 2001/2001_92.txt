Dear All:

A good friend sent me this today: =20

Read about this horrible new virus. A new virus has just been discovered =
that has been classified by Microsoft and by McAfee as the most =
destructive ever! This virus was discovered yesterday afternoon by =
McAfee and no vaccine has yet been developed. This virus simply destroys =
Sector Zero from the hard disk, where vital information for its =
functioning are stored. This virus acts in the following manner:

It sends itself automatically to all contacts on your list with the =
title "A Virtual Card for You". As soon as the supposed virtual card is =
opened, the computer freezes so that the user has to reboot. When the =
ctrl+alt+del keys or the reset button are pressed, the virus destroys =
Sector Zero, thus permanently destroying the hard disk.

Yesterday in just a few hours this virus caused panic in New York, =
according to news broadcast by CNN ( http://www.cnn.com/   ). This alert =
was received by an employee of Microsoft itself. So don't open any mails =
with subject "A Virtual Card for You".

As soon as you get the mail, delete it. Please pass on this mail to all =
your friends. Forward this to everyone in your address book. I would =
rather receive this 25 times than not at all. Also: Intel announced that =
a new and very destructive virus was discovered recently. If you receive =
an email called "An Internet Flower For You", do not open it. Delete it =
right way! This virus removes all dynamic link libraries(.dll files) =
from your computer. Your computer will not be able to boot up.

SEND THIS TO EVERYONE ON YOUR CONTACT LIST!!
