Subject: Extension of Cycle 7 Archival Research Proposals


Dear Colleagues--
   I would like to call your attention to a new opportunity to submit proposals
for Archival Research only, in response to the existing HST Cycle 7 Call for
Proposals.
   As you may be aware, the current schedule for completion of Cycle 7,
including the GTO and supplemental NICMOS GO programs, extends to June
1999.  With this timeframe we are planning to issue the Cycle 8 Call for
Proposals in mid-1998, with selection and award to occur approximately one
year from now.  This implies that two full years would elapse between
opportunities to submit proposals for funded archival research.
   At the same time, data from the new instruments on board HST is being
acquired at large data rates.  In addition, the success of our efforts to
schedule parallel observations, the great majority of which are immediately
being placed in the public domain, means that there is an untapped wealth of
important scientific data ready to be analyzed.  For this reason, we believe
that it is important now to offer an additional opportunity for you to submit
proposals for archival research.  The NASA HST Project and our advisory
committees are fully supportive of this initiative.
   I am therefore announcing a new deadline of 27 February 1998 for the
submission of Archival Research proposals, and to allow for the fastest
possible turn around we are using the existing Cycle 7 Call for Proposals.  As
stated in the CP, proposals should be submitted on the special AR proposal
form, and the form must be submitted both in hardcopy (two copies) and by
electronic mail.  Detailed Budget Forms must be submitted with the paper
copies of the AR proposal.
   As in the past, this opportunity is restricted to investigators affiliated 
with U.S. institutions.  The peer review will be conducted in early April, and 
we expect to announce the new Archival Research awards by early May 1998. 
After 12 January 1998 detailed up-to-date information about this opportunity
may be found on the STScI World Wide Web home page at the addresses listed
below:

o HST Archive Information

   Please note that the next opportunity to submit proposals for both HST
observations and archival research funding will occur with Cycle 8 later in
1998.
