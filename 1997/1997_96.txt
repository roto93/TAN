Hello,
I'm sending the following advertisement on the
behalf of Jim Houck.  Please bring it to the
attention of anyone you know who might be interested.
Thank you,

Jamie Diller
Project Administrator
Cornell University
607/255-4805

IRS SCIENCE CENTER

Applications are invited for two Research
Associate/Senior Research Associate positions
within the SIRTF Infrared Spectrograph, IRS,
project.  A science data analysis center is being
established at Cornell University to support the
planning, reduction, and analysis of IRS GTO
research.  The anticipated staff will number
eight to ten during the flight program.

The IRS consists of a set of four mid-infrared
spectrographs covering the range from 5 to 40
microns with resolutions of 50 and 600.  The low
resolution spectrographs operate in the long-slit
mode, while the high resolution spectrographs
operate in the echelle mode.  The IRS has no
moving parts.  Additional information on the IRS can be viewed at:
http://astrosun.tn.cornell.edu/SIRTF/irshome.htm.

The IRS is designed to provide very high
sensitivity in support a wide range of galactic
and extragalactic research projects.  SIRTF is
currently scheduled for launch on December 1, 2001.

Applications are invited for an individual to
lead the establishment of the IRS Science Center.
 This person will work closely with the IRS
science team to organize and plan the GTO
program.  Applications are invited for a second
individual to coordinate the development of the
hardware and software infrastructure needed to support the Center.

Candidates should have a Ph.D. (or equivalent) in
astronomy, physics, or a related field.
Appointments are contingent upon evidence of
completion of a Ph.D.  Annual salaries can vary
according to the applicants' qualifications and
experience.  The initial appointments are for two
years.  However, it is anticipated that the
appointments will be extended throughout the SIRTF's five year mission.

Please send a brief statement of research
interests, a curriculum vita, bibliography and
names of three scientists who can be contacted
for letters of reference to J.R. Houck at Cornell
University by February 15, 1998.  Email
submissions to jrh13@cornell.edu are encouraged!
Mailing address is 220 Space Sciences, Cornell
University, Ithaca, NY 14853.  The positions will
be filled as soon as qualified applicants are identified.
