Attention: Professor K.Y. Lo
 
The IAA invites applicants with an independent research plan for several
tenure track positions, available July 1 1998. Research interests at the
IAA include, but are not limited to, Solar system formation and nuclear
astrophysics; Galactic and extra galactic star formation; YSO's and disks,
starbursts, dwarf galaxies, high-z galaxies; galactic structure and
dynamics; the Galactic center and AGN's; clusters of galaxies, large scale
structure of the Universe and Cosmology. Theorists as well as observers are
encouraged to apply. Rank will be commensurate with qualifications and
experience. The IAA has ample international travel support and substantial
computing facilities. Besides guaranteed access to
Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland Association (BIMA) 10-element mm-wave array, the
IAA is also engaged in expanding the Smithsonian Submillimeter-wave Array
(SMA) from 6 telescopes to 8 telescopes to be placed on Mauna Kea, Hawaii.
The IAA is starting a joint project (TAOS- Taiwan-American Occultation
Survey) with the US Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory ant the National
Central University in Taiwan to conduct a census of Kuiper Belt objects. In
addition, there are plans to develop IR instrumentation and experiments on
the CMBR. Applicants with hardware and software expertise, especially in
submm or IR/optical instrumentation, are also encouraged to apply.
 
Applicants should submit a CV, a statement to outline an independent
research plan, and three letters of reference to Professor K.Y. Lo at the
above address. Applications received by 15 December 1997 will be given
prompt attention. Candidates on the short lists will be asked to visit the
IAA for an interview and present a colloquim.
