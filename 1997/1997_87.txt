1997 December 22-23, Mini-workshop on
WHAT CAN THEORETICAL PHYSICISTS DO IN BIOLOGY?

Center for Complex Systems, National Central University
Department of Physics, National Central University

PREAMBLE

     The Center for Theoretical Sciences, sited at the National Tsinghua=20
University, was established by the National Science Council on 1997=20
August 1.  A prime mission for the Physics Division of CTS is to sponsor=20
or conduct Topical Programs focusing on topics that are current and=20
important, or those deemed to have the potential to be so in the near=20
future, and will have a high impact on the local research community.  CTS=
=20
recently targeted "biology Inspired Theoretical Physics" as a potential=20
topical program.

     In order to insure the program be properly focused and motivated,=20
CTS conducted two informal discussion meetings with a number of=20
biologists who are sympathetic to this initiative in October and=20
November.  Records of those meetings may be obtained from the CTS website=
=20
(http://www.cts.nthu.edu.tw/program/TP-BITP-e.html).  This mini-workshop=20
will provide an opportunity for practicing biologists, biophysicists and=20
theoretical physicists who are interested in finding out research=20
possibilities in this interdisciplinary field to meet each other, discuss=
=20
important issues in biology on which theoretical physics and mathematical=
=20
method may make an impact and generally exchange information.  With luck=20
some consensus on a set of specific research topics and strategies for=20
attacking these topics will emerge.  Included in the program will be=20
sessions for panel discussion and "town-hall" discussions.

REGISTRATION FEE

     There will be no registration fee for attending the workshop.
