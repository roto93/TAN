Subject: IUCAF Report on WRC-97 (Condensed)


Dear Colleague,

Below you will find a condensed version of the IUCAF Report on the ITU
World Radiocommunication Conference WRC-97 held in Geneva in
October/November. The Radio Astronomy Service did quite well during
this Conference, thanks to the hard work of a number of radio
astronomers.

Besides the specific results on radio astronomy related issues, some
impressions are given of the atmosphere at the Conference and the
strong forces at work.

Sincerely Yours,

Willem Baan

     RADIO ASTRONOMY AND EARTH EXPLORATION ISSUES AT ITU WRC-97
             Geneva, October 27 to November 21, 1997

                   by Willem A. Baan, Chairman

1.	INTRODUCTION

The bi-annual ITU World Radiocommunication Conference ("WRC-97") has
been held in Geneva from October 27 to November 21, 1997. Spectrum
allocation issues for the Radio Astronomy ("RAS") were not on the
Agenda for this Conference, only issues of peripheral interest.
However, the allocation of spectrum for the Earth Exploration Satellite
("EES") service was an important part of the Agenda, because the EES
had not been allocated any spectrum since 1979. Participation from both
the radio astronomy and Earth exploration communities was strong during
the Conference and both the EES and the RAS were successful on all
relevant issues. The ITU Radiocommunication Assembly ("RA") dealing
with the work of the ITU Study Groups was held in the week preceding
WRC-97.

RADIO ASTRONOMY PARTICIPATION --- The radio astronomy and remote
sensing communities were well represented at the Conference and there
was strong and effective coordination between both passive user
communities. The remote sensing people were all part of national
delegations. The following astronomers participated in WRC-97:

			  Delegation
S. Ananthkrishnan 	  India 		week 123
Willem Baan (USA)	  IUCAF			week 1234 
Jim Cohen (UK)		  IUCAF			week 1234
Boris Doubinskii (Russia) IUCAF			Radio Assembly + w1
Tomas Gergely		  United States		week 1234
Stanislav Gorgolevsky 	  Poland		week 34
Hans Kahlmann		  Netherlands 		week 12
Tom Kuiper (USA) 	  IUCAF			week 2
Dave Morris (France)	  IUCAF 		week 23
Masatoshi Ohishi (Japan)  IUCAF 		week 12
Ken Tapping		  Canada 		week 1234
Titus Spoelstra		  Netherlands 		week 34
Paul VandenBout		  United States		week 2
John Whiteoak		  Australia		week 234
Anders Winnberg (Sweden)  IUCAF			week 2

A big "THANK YOU" to all participants for their part in making this a
successful RA and Conference. With 15 delegates the RAS had a midsize
delegation. IUCAF thanks Paul VandenBout, director of the National
Radio Astronomy Observatory (USA), for his attendance of the Conference
and for his support of the radio astronomy delegation.

COORDINATED ACTION OF IUCAF AND ADMINISTRATIONS --- As a Sector Member
of the ITU, IUCAF can participate in all discussion forums within the
ITU without itself having voting rights. IUCAF acts as an independent
voice for the passive services, and again at this Conference there was
very effective interplay between IUCAF and the national delegations.
IUCAF and the radio astronomy community have become a "known entity" at
the ITU, because the message of "protection for passive services" has
not changed over the years and there are no hidden agendas.  The
presence and the active participation of so many RAS/IUCAF delegates on
large number of Agenda Items have strongly reinforced the need to
protect the RAS and other passive spectrum users. The ITU reality is
that decisions will be made, with or without RAS input. Therefore, it
is essential that the (more) radio astronomers are active at these
battlefields.

THANK YOU --- IUCAF recognizes the considerable support of India,
France, The Netherlands, United Kingdom, United States, and Sweden on
radio astronomy related issues during this Conference. IUCAF also
recognizes the active support of members from the remote sensing
community during this Conference.

IUCAF submitted a position document to WRC-97 on Agenda Items relevant
to the passive service community (WRC-97 Document 144-E; IUCAF WWW doc
440). IUCAF also submitted a position document to the ITU RA, which
dealt with a recommendation from the satellite community to use Monte
Carlo methods to calculate the interference levels into radio
telescopes in the 1600 MHz bands (RA97/PLEN/54; WWW doc 439). In
addition, IUCAF distributed a large number of copies of a popular
article on "Radio Astronomy in the 21st Century" (K. Kellerman, Sky &
Telescope, February 1997) during the last week of WRC-97. Paul
VandenBout also presented a popular lunch talk on "What do the Radio
Astronomers use all that radio spectrum for?"

The final acts of WRC-97 contain some 550 pages. An estimated 7.7
million pages were reproduced during WRC-97 or about 3000 pages per
participant.

In the following Section 2, some remarks will be made on the Conference
and its working climate. Section 3 presents the Conference results on
important RAS and EES issues. The relevant Agenda Items to be
considered at the next WRC-99 are listed. An extended version of this
document (Doc 441) and all relevant WRC-97 documents are on the IUCAF
Home Page.

2       CONFERENCE EVALUATION AND FUTURE WORK

MORE RAS PARTICIPANTS ARE NEEDED TO PREPARE FOR WRC-99 --- The radio
astronomy spectrum above 71 GHz is part of the Agenda for WRC-99, Item
1.16 together with EESS (passive). This will be the LAST change for the
RAS to make any changes in the current mmwave spectrum allocations up
to 275 GHz and to forcefully address protection and interference issues
at mmwave frequencies. We need to be successful at that Conference.

The IUCAF mmWave Working Group, chaired by Phil Jewell (GMRT) and
Masatoshi Ohishi (NRO), in collaboration with ITU-R Working Party 7D on
Radio Astronomy, chaired by John Whiteoak (CSIRO), has been doing
preparatory studies on this topic for almost a year. However,
participation from more radio astronomers and the support from all
(mmwave) observatories are required for the coming years. The Kyoto
Declaration needs to be put to work!!

The next WP 7D meeting will be in Geneva, March 2-6, 1998, preceded by
a two-day open IUCAF preparatory meeting for WRC-99 on February 27-28
in Grenoble. These meetings will be a good time for people to start
participating in the ITU proceedings.

WRC-97 CONFERENCE ATMOSPHERE --- In general, this Conference can be
characterized by "See your investment dollars at work." There was again
much "pushing and shoving" in order to advance specific commercial
interests, often at the expense of sound "spectrum management".
Lobbying efforts of the developing countries were intensive.

BLOCK VOTING AT THE CONFERENCE --- At past meetings, the 40 plus
European CEPT countries have presented European Common Proposals on
many issues in the ITU. Similarly now, some 20 Asia-Pacific countries
presented the APT proposals and also the 12 CITEL countries presented
their IAP proposals. The Arab and African countries also formed rather
coherent blocks but without putting in unified/prepared proposals.

MANY RECEPTIONS --- During the first three weeks, there were receptions
nearly each evening for which all 1000+ participants were invited. Some
parties were extremely lavish and their budgets were far larger than
the annual budgets for spectrum management in many countries. The
atmosphere at the WRConferences is changing rapidly.

	CONFERENCE TRENDS
1.      The Conference showed a continued pressure from operators and
certain administrations to consolidate more spectrum allocations for
specific satellite applications.
2.      Serious coordination efforts still need to be made to allow
implementation of many planned (mostly non-GSO) satellite systems and
to allow a peaceful coexistence of new systems and existing systems. It
appears that sharing in certain bands between different satellite
systems and various terrestrial applications will be very difficult if
not impossible.
3.      The demand for high frequency spectrum has risen dramatically
with the possibility of terrestrial and satellite-based high-density
data systems. Specific assignments have been made for such applications
up to frequencies of 66 GHz. Although many of these systems could still
be far away in the future, astronomers are warned that the (currently
interference-free) mmwave spectral regions may soon have active
applications.
4.      Other services, like those of terrestrial fixed and
aeronautical radio navigation, are getting seriously worried about
"harmful interference", which was strongly expressed at the Conference.
It appears that the RAS and EES are not anymore the only sufferers from
unwanted emissions and there may be some new allies for the passive
spectrum users.

	HOT ISSUES AT WRC-97
1. 	Aggregate Power Flux Density limits in Article S22 to allow
frequency sharing between non-GSO and GSO Fixed Satellite (FSS) and
Broadcasting Satellite (BSS) networks allowing non-GSO systems like
Celestri (Motorola) and SkyBridge (Alcatel) to operate together in a
band. This compromise apparently goes at the expense of the existing
GSO systems sharing these bands, which will have difficulty operating
under these standards.
2. 	An extension band (sE) allocation for Inmarsat around 1600 MHz has
been deferred to WRC-99 (Agenda Item 1.9).
3. 	Satellite broadcasting channel plans for finding an equitable
distribution for all countries.
4. 	HF Broadcasting issues were extremely important for developing
countries.
5. 	Appendices S30 and S30A of the Radio Regulations harmonizing the
feeder link plans for GSO BSS and FSS systems.
6.	Lengthy/confusing discussions on deletions/changes in country
footnotes from the Radio Regulations.

3 ACTIONS ON AGENDA ITEMS OF WRC-97 RELEVANT TO RADIO ASTRONOMY AND
EARTH EXPLORATION

A.      SPURIOUS EMISSION LIMITS

The results from ITU-R Task Group 1/3 have been adopted by the
Conference and have been incorporated in Appendix S3 of the Radio
Regulations. Section II of S3 has the new standards that will apply for
all systems installed after Jan 2003 and for all transmitters after Jan
2012. We will have to wait six years before the new (and greatly
inadequate) Category A limits (dating from the seventies) will be first
enforced.

Recommendation 66 has been revised during the Conference such that
ITU-R Task Group 1/5 can continue its work. TG1/5 chaired by Mohan
Dhamrait (UK) will address the following issues: a) the (outstanding)
spurious emission limits for the space services, b) the spurious
Out-of-Band (OOB) emission limits for all services and particularly for
services not presently included in S3, c) the rewrite of
Recommendations on Spurious and OOB emissions, and d) to find the
reasonable boundary between spurious and OOB. In particular, TG 1/5 has
been tasked to study those bands that need more stringent limits on
spurious and OOB to protect passive and safety services, and the impact
of implementing or not implementing these limits. The dominant
perception is that "general spurious limits" for active services should
not be used to protect the passive services in a few bands.

IUCAF has been actively participating in the work of Task Group 1/3 and
presently in TG 1/5. More radio astronomers need to participate in this
important work.

B.         BANDS BELOW 1 GHZ

Footnote RR S5.186, providing co-primary status for the RAS in the band
79.25 - 80.25 MHz in Region 3, has been suppressed at the request of
the Fixed and Mobile services. This band was totally unusable for
astronomers in Region 3. Another exclusive allocation for RAS in Region
2 in the 73 - 74.6 MHz band with footnotes in Regions 1 and 3 may serve
better as a band in this frequency range. Some return favor from the FS
and MS and cooperation at the next conference will be required.

C.         MOBILE SATELLITE SERVICE

India made proposals were carried to modify Footnote S5.208A relating
to the protection of radio astronomy from MSS (sE) operations in the
bands below 1 GHz. The modified footnote is slightly stronger but it is
still not obligatory.

No new MSS (sE) allocations below 1 GHz. New MSS (Earth-to-space)
allocations were made in the bands 455 - 456 MHz and 459 - 460 MHz for
MSS in Region 2 only.

A new resolution calls for studies on the impact of NGSO MSS (sE) in
the band 405 - 406 MHz on primary services in adjacent bands including
the RAS in the band 406.1 - 410 MHz.

Studies have been called for on "Frequency Sharing in the Bands 1610.6
- 1613.8 MHz and 1660 - 1660.5 MHz between MSS and RAS" using ITU-R
M.1316 (Monte Carlo method) and other relevant ITU-R Recommendations.
This issue is not yet on a future Conference Agenda.

The Land MSS allocation in the band 1660 - 1660.5 MHz has been
converted to general MSS. Footnote S5.376A with "thou shalt not
interfere with RAS" has been added.

COM5-15 calls for studies to consider possible feeder link allocations
for non-GSO MSS (Little LEO) systems in bands adjacent to the 1400 -
1427 MHz passive band. (WRC-01 Agenda 3.5)

Maritime Mobile (except aeronautical mobile) has been added to the band
14.47 - 14.5 GHz, where RAS has secondary status for formaldehyde line.
Studies are planned. RAS needs to get upgrade to Primary in near
future.

D.      FIXED SATELLITE SERVICE

The non-GSO FSS feeder link allocation in the band 15.4 -15.7 GHz has
been modified to 15.43 - 15.63 GHz. This band is adjacent to the
primary RAS band 15.35 - 15.4 GHz. Footnote S5.511A specifically states
that FSS (sE) shall not cause harmful to RAS stations in the band 15.35
- 15.4 GHz based on RA.769 and calls for special measures to protect
the RAS. (WRC-99 Agenda 1.14) It appears unlikely that this band can be
used at all for FSS (sE). The American Ellipso system plans to use this
band in (Es) direction. A Russian system is planned for the (sE)
direction.

The band 40.5 - 42.5 GHz has been provisionally allocated to Fixed
Satellite Service (sE) subject to feasibility studies. This band is
adjacent to the 42.5 - 43.5 GHz RAS band in Regions 1 and 3. The USA
and UK object to use the upper 1 GHz of the band for this purpose,
which may serve as guard band. (WRC-99 Agenda 1.4)

E       EARTH EXPLORATION ISSUES

A proposal from the Netherlands to use 6 MHz in the 420 - 470 MHz range
for observations of forest canopy and ground-trunk interactions
received little support from the Conference. (WRC-99 Agenda 8.7)

Some 18 allocations for the Earth Exploration Satellite service have
been made in bands from 400 MHz to 94 GHz. Some of these allocations
were upgrades from secondary to Primary and some are new worldwide
Primary allocations. Many have restrictive "non-interference to
existing services" footnotes. IUCAF has requested that EES and SR
operations in the band 3100 - 3300 MHz begin at the bottom of the band,
in order to protect RAS observations of the CH molecule.

The allocation of the 94 -94.1 GHz band for space-borne cloud radars.
The specific frequency range has been suggested by radio astronomers
because of its low number of spectral lines. A new footnote RR S5.562
has been added to the 94 - 94.1 GHz band to reserve this for cloud
radars only. These radars will be turned off over mmwave
observatories.

Extensive studies have been done to realign the allocations in the 50.2
- 71 GHZ bands to accommodate the needs of the EES (passive) and SR
(passive) and other active services (like Inter-Satellite Service) in
the high-opacity oxygen absorption bands. In the process, the purely
passive bands have been reduced from 4.85 GHz to 3.65 GHz. Space-based
radio astronomy in this band could share spectrum with terrestrial
services and EESS (passive) and SR (passive).

Allocations for EESS (passive) above 71 GHz have been deferred to
WRC-99. A new resolution calls for studies of EESS (passive) and RAS
frequency bands above 71 GHz. (WRC-99 Agenda 1.16) This is important
for mmwave astronomy.

F       HIGH DENSITY FIXED SERVICE

HIGH ALTITUDE PLATFORM (HAP) systems as proposed by SkyStation have
been allocated spectrum in the FS (sE) bands 47.2 - 47.5 GHz (sE) and
47.9 - 48.2 GHz (Es) via new footnote RR S5 552A. These allocations are
subject to further studies that include the protection of the two
Primary RAS allocations in the bands 42.5 - 43.5 GHz and 48.94 - 49.09
GHz. These stratospheric balloon platforms will be positioned between
20 and 80 km above major cities (around the world). IUCAF expressed
strong concerns about the unwanted emission from such broad band
applications. (WRC-99 Agenda Item 1.5). Radio astronomers discussed
details of SkyStation and the protection of the RAS in adjacent bands
during special meeting.

Bands have been allocated for HIGH DENSITY FIXED SERVICE applications
in the bands 31.8 - 33.4 GHz (secondary in Regions 1 and 3), 51.4 -
52.6 GHz, 55.8 - 59 GHz, and 64 - 66 GHz. These allocations are subject
to further study. WRC-99 Agenda 1.4.
