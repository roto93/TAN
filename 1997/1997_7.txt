Dear Dr. Yi-Jehng,

     I tend to agree with you that your announcement still serves the purpose 
     for those people who are not in Taiwan at this time that they can get to
     know the kind of activities that are going on there.  I would like to 
     remain on your mailing list unless you will change your policy.

With best wishes,
   Ying-chi Lin

  Dear Yi-Jehng,

  Please keep the talk announcements. They provide an idea of what is happening
  in astronomy in Taiwan --- one of the purposes of TAN, I believe.

  Best wishes,
  John Wang
