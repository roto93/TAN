                               FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT

Dear Colleague:

       We are pleased to inform you about the Euroconference `Extrasolar 
Planets: Formation, Detection and Modelling', to be held in the beautiful 
town of Lisbon, Portugal, from 27 April to 1 May and sponsored by the 
European Union, the Lisboa University and the Paris Observatory. 

       This is the first event of a series of three Euroconferences, 
sponsored by the European Union and coordinated by the Paris Observatory 
under the general title Physics and Techniques in Relation With Matter 
Processing Throughout the Stellar and Galactic Universe. 

After the discovery of the first planetary systems, it is now necessary 
to go further and to: 
       - extend significantly the sample of stars to be monitored 
       - detect giant planets by direct imaging 
       - search for Earth-like planets 
       - detect rings and satellites of giant planets 
       - measure the chemical composition of planet atmospheres, especially for exobiological purposes. 
       The objective of this Workshop is to cover these topics and to: 
         - help the coordination of european research on extrasolar planets 
         - help the training of young researchers in this very promising emerging field 
         - present and discuss recent results from research on planetary 
systems, including models of formation and evolution and detection. 

       The topics covered by the invited lecturers will include: 
              methods of detection 
                . optical imaging and astrometry 
                . radial velocity 
                . radioastronomical methods 
                . photometric methods (transits and lensing) 
              the formation of planetary systems 
              planetary atmospheres and exobiology 
              ground based surveys 
              future generation of space missions 

       There will also be a certain number of contributed papers from 
participants. 

        Grants will be allocated , after selection by the Organizing 
Committee, to students and young researchers needing financial support 
(no more than 35). 

The registration form can be retrieved at the conference homepage 
(see address below) where further information will be added soon. 

If you want to receive further announcements or information about this 
conference, or an email message with the registration form, please send 
us a message and we will add you to our mailing list.

The deadline for registration is March 1, 1998.


Thank you
