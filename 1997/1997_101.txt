This would be a basic general interest colloquium -- more descriptive
than quantitative for physicists of a range of ages and interests.
This would be a general discussion of what we can learn from CMB and 
large scale structure that will enable us to test inflation and other 
exotic ideas. It also reviews briefly the past century of cosmology.
