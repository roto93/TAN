1.  DEATH OF DAVID N. SCHRAMM 

Dr. David N. Schramm, a current member of the AAS Council, was
killed Friday, Dec. 19, when the twin-engine plane he was
piloting crashed outside of Denver.  He was en route from his
home in Chicago to his second home in Aspen, Colorado.  Schramm,
Vice President for Research and Louis Block Professor
Distinguished Service Professor in the Physical Sciences at the
University of Chicago, was 52.  His death is a serious loss to
his many friends and colleagues in the AAS.

A session for colleagues to remember Schramm's contribution to
astronomy will be planned at the DC Meeting.  Check the 
message board at registration for details.

3.  OSS SENIOR SCIENTIST

NASA's Office of Space Science is seeking a senior scientist 
to fill a civil service position in the Optical and Infrared/Radio 
Astrophysics Program.

The position description can be found in the AAS Job Register, 
No. 9796, at http://www.aas.org/JobRegister/aasjobs.html.  
Applications must be received by 5 January 1998.

4.  NASA GRANTS REVIEW - REGIONAL WORKSHOPS

A NASA team is conducting an end-to-end review of the grants 
management process, with an eye to identifying ways to streamline 
the process so as to reduce cycle time, reduce burden (both on 
NASA and on the community outside), and reduce cost of managing 
the process. Before forming recommendations to NASA management 
in March 1998, the team plans to travel to five locations across 
the country for discussions with regional stakeholders (both 
researchers and research administrators).

Discussion meetings are planned at 
Scripps Institution of Oceanography; La Jolla, CA (January 20), 
Univ. Corp. for Atmospheric Research (UCAR); Boulder, CO (January 21), 
University of Maryland/Baltimore County; Baltimore, MD (January 26), 
Lunar and Planetary Institute; Houston, TX (January 27), and 
Florida State University; Tallahassee, FL (January 28).

Details about the grants process review and the discussion 
meetings will be posted at URL

Up to ten competitive fellowships are available for
graduate or postdoctoral students.  The central theme of the 
1998 GFD program is the application of dynamical systems techniques 
in astro- and geophysical flows. 

The application deadline is 14 February 1998. 

Further information and an electronic application form for student
fellowships are available online at http://www.whoi.edu/gfd

Prospective senior visitors, please contact Neil Balmforth, the
