Dear Wen Ping and Wen-Shean,

Spurred by the report on TAOS (NATURE, vol. 390, 544, 12/11/97) Miss
Yang, Wei-  Ming of China
Times called me at home Thursday night asking about TAOS.  She    then
ran a story today
(Monday, 12/29/97, p.7) which is full of errors.  I am  angry  and is
sending her the letter
enclosed below demanding the paper to run  a clarification.  However,
the damage is done and I
apologize for this incident. I will be happy to discuss any further
actions that you consider
appropriate
when we meet tommorrow at 10 am in your institute.

Sincerely

Typhoon

Dear Mr. Hwang,
Chief Editor
CHINA TIMES DAILY

I will appreciate it that CHINA TIMES run a clarification on the TAOS
story      which appeared
on p.7 Monday, Dec.29.

TAOS is a collaboration among three partners shown in the following
table:

TABLE: TAOS Partners
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics
   Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL)
   Livermore, California, USA

   Principal Investigator: Charles Alcock

   Funding Source: Department of Energy, NASA (Origin of Solar System
Program)

2. Institute of Astronomy,
   National Central University (NCU)
   Chung-Li, TAIWAN ROC

   Principal Investigator: Wen-Ping Chen

   Funding Source:  National Science Council, Ministry of Education

3. Institute of Earth Science, Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics
   Academia Sinica (AS)
   Nankang, Taipei TAIWAN ROC

   Principal Investigator: Typhoon Lee, Chi Yuan

   Funding Source:Academia Sinica (Inter-institutional Topical Research
Program)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The responsibility of each of the three partners is to provide one
telescope     with its
associated peripherals to form a three telscope array which is to be
sited near the Lu-Lin
Observing Station of NCU in Taiwan's Jade Mountain        National
Park.  The selection of the
site is based on NCU's multi-year survey of the sky condition at Lu-Lin
which is good for
optical observation using small to medium size telescopes for over 200
nights per year.  The
project would alsobenefit from NCU's past experience in conducting
mannual occultation
observation using small telescopes and from the technical capability of
the AS developed
from building sub-mm wave telescopes and running automatic remote
seismometer    networks.

There is also a confusion in your article about the Kuiper Belt and the
home of      comets.
Comets are thought to have been made 4.56 billion years ago in the
the outer solar system
beyond Saturn as mixtures of ice and dust.  They were scattered by the
gravity of major planets
such as Jupiter over the entire solar system.  However, only those
around ten thousands
astronomical units (AU =      earth-sun distance) have orbits stable
enough against the
perturbation by       passing stars and the major planets over the age
of the solar system.
This     population is called the O'ort Cloud. Conventionally, this was
thought to be    the
home of comets today.  In the past few years, two discoveries forced
the    planetary science
community to revise this view.  First, theoretical studies of   cometary
orbital dynamics
suggested that the Jupiter family of short period  comets came from a
belt in the plane of the
planetary orbits (the ecliptic) thuswere not from the O'ort Cloud whose
distribution are not
concentrated toward the ecliptic.  Secondly, a search using large
optical telescopes from Hawaii
indeed found several dozens of comets near the ecliptic just beyond the
orbit of      Neptune
(i.e. at distance a little large than 30 AU).  These discoveries revived
the earlier speculation
proposed almost half a century ago by Edgeworth and     Kuiper.  So this
new home of comets was
christened the Kuiper Belt.  In short,  your article is mistaken in
saying that the Kuiper belt
is ten thousands AU     away.  That distance is for Oort Cloud, the old
home for comets.  The
new home for comets, Kuiper belt, is located just beyond 30 AU and no
one really knows
far it extends.

The Kuiper comets imaged so far are about 200 km in size, much larger
than the
typical comets observed near earth, whose nuclei are less than about 20
km in    size.  The
light reflected from comets of this size at the Kuiper belt is too  dim
to observe direcly even
with the largest telescope in the world.  This is    the reason to use
the occulation techniques
that our TAOS project will use.
