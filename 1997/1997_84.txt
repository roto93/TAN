1.  DC MEETING NOTES

Hotel Registration Cut-off Today
The hotel registration cutoff is today, 10 December.  The Hilton 
will accept reservations at the convention rate as long as rooms 
are available, however, we are fast approaching our room block, 
so don't delay in getting your requests in. Reservations 202-797-5820

Public Policy Activities at the Meeting
Wednesday:
11:40-12:30	Daniel Goldin, NASA Administrator
 1:00- 2:00	Hugh Van Horn, Director, Division of Astronomical
			Sciences, NSF

Thursday:
11:40-12:30	Robert Eisenstein, Assistant Director of Mathematical
			and Physical Sciences, NSF
 2:00- 3:30	Panel Discussion featuring 
		the Honorable Vernon J. Ehlers, R-MI; 
		John Bahcall, Institute for Advanced Study; 
		Charles Townes, University of California, Berkeley.

Parking at the Meeting

Due to the closing of a major parking garage, and the renovation of
the garage at the hotel, parking will be very limited at this meeting.
If you are staying in the hotel and have a car, there will be no
problem.  The daily charge is $12.00.  If you are commuting to the
meeting, please try to take public transportation if at all possible.
There is a garage across from the hotel - the Atlantic Garage that has
limited parking at $8.00/day.  They are limited and often have a
"garage full" sign in the driveway.  Usually, you can drive on in and
find something.  Street parking is almost impossible - most of it is
permit only or a two hour limit.

2.  COMMITTEE ON GRAVITATIONAL PHYSICS SOLICITS INPUT
    Roc Riemer, National Academy of Sciences

The National Research Council's Board on Physics and Astronomy 
(BPA) decadal survey of the fields of physics will contain a 
volume on Gravitational Physics prepared by a Committee on 
Gravitational Physics (CGP).  The report will make recommendations 
on both experimental and theoretical gravitational physics.  Further 
details may be found at 

	www.nas.edu/bpa/projects/cgp  

The committee invites written comments from scientists working in 
gravitational physics on the topics listed on the CGP home page 
by the end of January 1998, which should be sent by e-mail to
bpa@nas.edu identifying "Gravitation" on the subject line, by 
fax to the BPA at 202-334-3575, or by mail to:

Board on Physics and Astronomy
HA-562
National Research Council
2101 Constitution Ave, NW
Washington, DC  20418

3.  NATIONAL ASTRONOMY AND IONOSPHERE CENTER
    CALL FOR OBSERVING PROPOSALS
    USING THE ARECIBO GREGORIAN SYSTEM
    Deadline :  15 December 1997
 	
The Arecibo Upgrade Project has now entered its commissioning phase, 
and consequently NAIC is making a call for observing proposals which 
can make use of the systems that are currently in the best operational 
state.  Such proposals should be submitted by 15 December 1997.  This 
is a call for proposals to use the telescope during its commissioning 
period.  

It is anticipated that NAIC will accept proposals with a February 1 
deadline for observing in the June 1 1998 to September 30 1998 period.  
Prospective proposers can find full details of the Arecibo Observatory, 
NAIC's policies, the telescope and its upgrade, and associated observing 
equipment at 

	http://www.naic.edu 
 
On arrival at http://www.naic.edu, select the Website map (magnifying-
glass icon on the right-hand side of the home page) which will show 
the full range of available information available on the site.  For
information on telescope performance, the Upgrade, receivers, the IF/LO
system, back-ends, etc., select the Telescope hyperlink under "Telescope
Information."
