co-sponsored by the IAU, the National Research Council (Canada),
the University of Victoria and the Canadian Institute of Theoretical
Astrophysics (CITA).

Further information on this symposium can be found at the WWW URL:

Please note that the SOC will use the responses given to this First
Announcement to choose many of the speakers.  If you are interested 
in attending this conference and giving a talk, please fill out and
return promptly the form below or on the above Web page.

I. Scientific Rationale
=======================

The Magellanic Clouds (MCs) provide an excellent laboratory to study
astrophysical processes because of their proximity, nearly face-on
viewing angle, and small internal and foreground extinction.  They are
the only galaxies for which it is possible to observe individual stars
and interstellar structures in great detail for the entire system.

The last IAU Symposium on the MCs was held in Sydney, Australia, in
1990.  Since that meeting significant advances have been made in many
areas as a result of new instrumentation, such as the Hubble Space
Telescope, the ROSAT and ASCA X-ray satellites, the UV Imaging
Telescope and ORFEUS-Spas shuttle missions, the IR Space Observatory,
the Australia Telescope Compact Array, the Swedish-ESO Submillimeter
Telescope, and large-format CCD and IR array detectors at major
southern observatories.

These new instruments have made possible large-scale surveys of
different phases of the ISM and of the stars in the MCs.  Examples
include the ROSAT surveys of the hot (10^6 K) ISM, the Curtis Schmidt
emission-line survey of the warm (10^4 K) ISM, the ATCA HI survey of
the neutral atomic ISM, the MACHO and EROS surveys of variable stars,
and the Scanning-CCD broad-band survey of stars.

These new instruments provide us with an opportunity to probe 
physical parameters/properties that were previously inaccessible.  
Consequently, the scientific frontier has been pushed to an 
unprecedented realm.

For the ISM, the ROSAT and ASCA satellites enable the determination 
of temperatures and abundances of the hot (10^6-10^7 K) ISM, HST UV 
spectroscopy shows the existence and physical conditions of 10^5 K 
gas, and ATCA reveals the HI distribution at 1' resolution.  It is 
now possible not only to study the physical conditions of individual 
structures, such as SNRs and supershells, but also to investigate 
comprehensively the multi-phase structure and evolution of the ISM 
over the entire galaxy.

For stars, the HST allows stellar populations to be studied with
higher spatial resolution so that the basic cluster characteristics
such as age, metallicity, and the IMF can be deduced with greater
accuracy.  With the large format detectors on ground-based telescopes,
studies involving millions of field stars have allowed the star
formation histories of the Clouds to be delineated in much greater
detail.  Recent space-based and ground-based high-resolution
spectroscopic studies of stars have revealed new insights about their
fundamental properties, mass loss, winds, and chemical evolution.
These findings supplement the improved grids of stellar evolutionary
models and model atmospheres that became available in the past years.

New views of the MCs are beginning to emerge from these recent
observations and theories.  It is thus an opportune time to hold an
international meeting on studies of the MCs.  It is our wish to
organize the meeting to emphasize the following topics:

(1) review recent advances in studies of stellar and interstellar 
    components of the MCs
(2) emphasize the interplay between the stellar and interstellar 
    components in the evolution of the MCs
(3) examine the detailed physical and dynamical structures, stellar 
    populations, and star formation histories of the MCs, so that
    this knowledge can be used as foundations to understand the 
    Galaxy as well as more distant galaxies
(4) plan future work utilizing the forthcoming IR/UV/X-ray satellite
    facilities and large ground-based telescopes


II. Outline of Scientific Program
=================================

 1. Recent observations of stars and the ISM of the Magellanic Clouds.
 2. The physical properties and structure of the multiple-phase ISM.
 3. Interactions between stars/OB association/clusters and the ISM.
 4. Stellar evolution - observations vs theoretical models.
 5. Stellar systems - IMFs, abundances, ages, dynamics, populations.
 6. Star formation history and evolution of the Magellanic Clouds.
 7. The global structure of the Magellanic Clouds - populations,
    distributions of matter, and dynamics.
 8. The Distance to the Magellanic Clouds.
 9. Connections to other Magellanic irregulars and the distant universe.

The scientific program of the meeting will consist of invited reviews
and contributed talks that are of general interest.  Other
contributions will be presented in posters.  Ample time will be
reserved for discussion and poster viewing.

    James Hesser,      chair LOC,         e-mail: Jim.Hesser@hia.nrc.ca


IV. Venue
=========

The meeting will be held on the campus of the University of Victoria,
which is located in suburban Victoria.  Bed and Breakfast style
accommodations will be available in student housing on campus, which
offers private rooms and shared bathrooms for very reasonable prices.
No block of rooms has been reserved in downtown hotels; participants
preferring hotel accommodations will be provided contact information in
the second announcement and on our Web page.  This will be high season
in Victoria, so hotel accommodations should be made well in advance of
arrival.

Victoria is situated on the Strait of Juan de Fuca near the Pacific
Coast, and provides easy access to many scenic National, Provincial 
and City parks in both Canada and the U.S. All are accessible by car 
(and possibly a ferry ride) within a day. They include the Pacific 
Rim National Park and Strathcona Provincial Park on Vancouver Island,
Garibaldi Provincial Park north of Vancouver, and the Olympic National
Park, North Cascades National Park and Mount Rainier National Park in
Washington State, as well as numerous State Parks and resorts along the
coasts of Washington and Oregon.  Temperate rain forests, mountains,
glaciers and vibrant aboriginal cultures are only part of the sights
available to visitors.  Family members accompanying participants will
find much to do in Victoria!

Temperatures in July typically range from a high of about 25 C to a 
low of 11 C. Probability of rain is low, except during international
conferences....

Our Web site provides many links to information about the area. 


V. Visa and Travel
==================

Participants are advised to check with their local Canadian consulate
or their travel agent regarding current visa requirements to enter
Canada. 

Frequent short flights connect Victoria to both Seattle and Vancouver
International Airports.  Non-stop flights are also available from
Calgary, Alberta.  Victoria's airport is about a 25 minute taxi ride
distant from the University or downtown.

An alternative, more leisurely route would be by rental car and the
B.C.  Ferry from Tswassen (south of Vancouver, Canada); from SeaTac this
connection requires about five hours, while from Vancouver's Airport it
requires about three.  There are additional ferry routes, for which
information will be found on our Web pages.

All participants are strongly recommended to check their medical
insurance for coverage during their stay in Canada.  The LOC will
not accept liability for sickness or accidents.


VI. Funding
===========

Limited funding is available to assist those who otherwise cannot
attend the conference due to financial constraints.  Generally only
partial support for the travel can be offered.  An application form
for the Travel Grant will be included in the registration form to be
sent in the Second Announcement.
