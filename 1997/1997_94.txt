Dear Physicists and Astronomers,

Please find below the final version of the TAW5 programme (5th Taipei
Astrophysics Workshop).  For more information please visit the TAW5
web-site at http://biaa.sinica.edu.tw/taw5/.

(please note that Prof Alcock's talk may be swapped with Prof Steinhardt's
if he won't be available at the scheduled time.  Again we will give a
one-night notice at the web-site before any change.)

Sincerely yours,

CHEN, Lin-wen
