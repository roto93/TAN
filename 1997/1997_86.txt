Dear Colleague/Recipient,
  An advertisement for The Bolton Fellowship, a post-doctoral position at the 
ATNF, follows. Please post it and/or pass it on to anyone interested. My 
apologies if you receive more than one copy of this notice.
  Yours sincerely,
     Dick Manchester

Australia Telescope National Facility, CSIRO
Marsfield NSW 

The Bolton Fellowship

Applications are invited for the inaugural Bolton Fellowship,
a three-year post-doctoral appointment tenable at any of the
Australia Telescope National Facility locations. The ATNF, a
Division of the CSIRO, has its headquarters in the
Radiophysics Laboratory at Marsfield, about 25 km from the
centre of Sydney, and operates a 64m telescope near Parkes,
NSW, a 6-element 6km synthesis telescope near Narrabri (the
Compact Array), NSW, and a 22m antenna near Coonabarabran,
NSW. A major upgrade of the Compact Array for operation at
wavelengths of 13mm and 3mm is currently under way. With
other Australian and overseas telescopes, the ATNF telescopes
operate as a VLBI array based on the S2 recording system. The
Marsfield site is shared with the Anglo-Australian
Observatory, which operates 4m and Schmidt optical telescopes
near Coonabarabran, and CSIRO Telecommunications and
Industrial Physics.

The Fellowship is named in honour of John Bolton FRS, a
pioneer of radio astronomy, who worked at the CSIRO Division
of Radiophysics from 1947 to 1981. Applicants must have (or
have satisfied the requirements for) a PhD degree in
astronomy, astrophysics or related disciplines.  The Bolton
Fellow will be expected to undertake research in one or more
areas which exploit the ATNF observational facilities, and
will have ample opportunity to make innovative contributions
to the development of the Facility in the spirit of John
Bolton.

The Bolton Fellow will receive a salary in the range of $A41K
to $A46K plus superannuation. Reasonable relocation expenses,
including return airfare to Australia if appropriate, will be
paid.

Applications should include a curriculum vitae, list of
publications, a statement of proposed research programmes,
and the names and addresses (preferably email) of three
referees familiar with the applicant's work. Applications
should be addressed to The Director, ATNF CSIRO, P.O. Box 76,
Epping NSW 2121, Australia.  The closing date for
applications is January 31, 1998.

programs, see the ATNF WWW pages at
