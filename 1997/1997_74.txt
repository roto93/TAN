Subject: Announcement of COSPAR Meeting in Nagoya, Japan

Dear Colleague,
     
     We would like to announce an exciting session that
we are organizing as part of the 32nd COSPAR meeting next July (12-18)
in Nagoya, Japan on "The Connection Between Normal and Active Galaxies."
We believe that this session will provide a rare opportunity for
rich scientific interactions between the researchers in both normal and 
active galaxies.  This message is being sent to potentially interested 
astronomers; please circulate it among your colleagues in case we have 
neglected to include them in the mailing list.

     The meeting currently has been allocated only one and a half days.  In 
light of the preliminary agenda (see below) and the interest so far expressed 
by some of you, we are hoping to extend the meeting to three full days.

     We encourage the submission of abstracts both for contributed
talks and for posters.  Abstracts are due by January 9th, and
should be sent simultaneously to kinney@stsci.edu (or fax number
410-338-4579) and to the COSPAR central office (cospar@copernicus.org,
or fax number 49-5556-4709).  The tex form and style file can be
retrieved from the web address given above.  All participants 
who want to present results must submit abstracts.  
      
     A description of the meeting is given below, along with
a preliminary agenda.  Full details of the meeting can be found
at the web site http://www.copernicus.org/COSPAR/.   
 
                                  Sincerely,   
                                  Organizing Committee,
                                  Luis Ho, 
                                  Satoru Ikeuchi, 
                                  Anne Kinney,
                                  Henrique Schmitt,

                The AGN/Normal Galaxy Connection
               Session E1.2, 32nd COSPAR Meeting

 
Goals and Motivation for the Meeting
-------------------------------------
   The main goal of this meeting is to build a framework for discourse on the 
connection between "normal" and "active" galaxy populations and the role of 
black holes in that connection.  This will set the stage for future 
discussions on the cosmological and physical evolution of both active galactic 
nuclei (AGNs) and normal galaxies, fields that are anticipated to undergo 
rapid progress with the current and near-future generation of space-based and 
large ground-based telescopes.

Evidence for Accretion-Powered Activity in Galaxies
---------------------------------------------------
    Two recent, parallel developments independently point to the prevalence of 
supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the centers of nearby galaxies.  On the one 
hand, evidence has been slowly accumulating through high-resolution kinematic
observations that massive dark objects, most likely black holes, appear to 
be quite common, at least in the relatively small samples studied so far. 
The kinematic evidence has been bolstered by photometric studies of 
early-type galaxies using the HST that suggest that perhaps most or all 
bulge-dominated systems contain SMBHs. One of the most remarkable findings 
of these studies is that the SMBH mass appears to be correlated with the 
mass of the bulge of the host galaxy.  On the other hand, ground-based surveys 
of nearby galaxies at optical and radio wavelengths have increasingly 
furnished evidence that a large fraction of galaxy nuclei, especially those 
in bulge-dominated systems, contain low-level nuclear activity qualitatively 
resembling much more powerful active galactic nuclei (AGNs) such as those 
found in "classical" Seyfert galaxies, radio galaxies, and quasars.  Within 
the conventional AGN paradigm, the observed widespread nuclear activity 
implies that SMBHs are a generic component of many present-day massive
galaxies, consistent with the picture emerging from the kinematic studies.
We aim to provide a comprehensive update of the status of AGN surveys 
both at low and high redshifts.  

Properties of the Host Galaxy and Clues to the Formation of SMBHs
-----------------------------------------------------------------
    The apparent prevalence of SMBHs in nearby galaxies opens up a suite of 
fascinating problems.  Do *all* galactic bulges, large and small, contain 
SMBHs?  If only some do, why are some galaxies so endowed and others not?   
Are SMBHs an inevitable by product of the formation or evolution of bulges?  
The suggested correlation between the masses of SMBHs and the masses of 
the spheroidal component of the host galaxies, if borne out by additional 
observations that are soon to become available from the Space Telescope 
Imaging Spectrograph on HST, will represent a truly astounding breakthrough 
in our understanding of nuclear activity.  

     How are SMBHs formed?  The dependence of the detection rate of AGNs
on the morphological type of galaxies, as well as the possible existence of 
a correlation between black hole mass and bulge mass, strongly suggest that 
significant clues may be found in examining the properties of bulges.
Evidence has been mounting that the central regions of galaxies which 
clearly have bulges exhibit light profiles that broadly fall into one of 
two families. These data suggest that the spheroidal components in 
galaxies may arise via different paths during the process of galaxy formation 
(e.g., dissipative vs. non-dissipative mergers), and it is therefore 
reasonable to postulate that the properties of the SMBH (e.g., its mass), or, 
indeed, its very presence, might depend on the galaxy's evolutionary history.  
Progress in these issues will require the participation of theorists 
expert in galaxy formation and in the physics of very dense stellar clusters.  
SMBHs might be seeded and ultimately grow from the normal formation and 
evolution of galactic bulges.  

     We will encourage a critical discussion of the latest photometric studies 
of the structure of nearby galactic bulges, of the properties of our own 
Galactic Center, of Seyfert galaxies, and of more distant quasars. The 
kinematic searches for SMBHs will be introduced to shed light on the 
connection between the presence of massive dark objects and the structure of 
the central regions of galaxies.  We will congregate theorists interested in 
the building galaxy bulges and in the formation and evolution of dense stellar 
systems.

Feeding the Central Engine
--------------------------
    This meeting will also provide a forum to address another longstanding, 
related issue in AGN research, namely how the SMBH is fueled.  The most 
promising ideas will be reviewed in light of the recent observations emerging 
from high-resolution studies of the gas content in nearby galaxies.  

    The standard optically thick, geometrically thin disk has provided a fairly
successful framework for describing the accretion process in AGNs.  It has 
recently been realized, however, that this paradigm is probably inappropriate 
for most nearby, low-luminosity, low-accretion rate systems.  AGNs such as 
those in M81, NGC 4258, and M87 emit markedly different spectral energy 
distributions compared to those in luminous AGNs.  This departure possibly 
signals a different regime in accretion physics, one that has received 
relatively little in the context of AGNs.  The most promising models so far 
advanced are those pertaining to "advection-dominated" accretion flows, and 
we intend to incorporate these timely developments into the overall program.
