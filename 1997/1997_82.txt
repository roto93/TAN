		         **** First Announcement ****
	     **** ULTRALUMINOUS GALAXIES:  MONSTERS OR BABIES ****
		      **** Ringberg Castle, Germany ****
		         **** 20 --- 26 Sep 1998 ****

We are pleased to present this first call for submissions for a
workshop studying the star formation and AGN properties of Ultraluminous
Galaxies to be held from 20 -- 26 September 1998 at the Schloss Ringberg
in Bavaria, Germany.  

PURPOSE OF THE WORKSHOP:

In a period of exciting new observational results, the goal of this workshop 
is to bring together scientists from across all wavelengths, and both
observational/theoretical backgrounds to discuss the fundamental issues 
concerning ultraluminous galaxies, namely:  
- The relative importance of AGNs vs star formation to their bolometric 
  luminosities
- The dynamics of stars and gas during the various stages of the merging 
  process
- The use of nearby luminous galaxies as "templates" for studies of galaxies 
  at high redshift
- (Cosmic) evolution of luminous galaxies.  

The structure of the workshop will be one where there are several
highlight or review talks, but the bulk of the presentations will come
from contributed talks selected by the SOC.  The oral presentations will
be relatively short to allow maximum time for open discussion.  
We emphasize that attendance will be limited to about 60 people. 

WORKSHOP VENUE:

The venue for the workshop is the Schloss Ringberg (Ringberg
Castle), a turn of the century castle located in the foothills of the
Bavarian Alps, and overlooking the Tegernsee.  Located about 70 km
south of Munich, the Tegernsee is a beautiful lake surrounded by
mountains and small resort villages.  The peaceful location, meeting
schedule, and attendance limit of 60 set by the size of the castle
are all conducive to an informal workshop atmosphere offering many
opportunities for stimulating discussion.

SCIENTIFIC ORGANIZING COMMITTEE:
  Linda Tacconi and Dieter Lutz (co-chairs)
  Reinhard Genzel
  Tim Heckman
  Lars Hernquist
  Carol Lonsdale
  Michael Rowan-Robinson
  Nick Scoville
  Yasuo Tanaka
  Roberto Terlevich

LIST OF SCIENTIFIC SESSIONS:
  Overview of Ultraluminous Galaxies, Surveys 
  The AGN vs Starburst Debate  
  Observational Results in the Optical/NIR, Millimeter, Radio (e.g. VLBI), 
     Mid/Far-IR (e.g. ISO), X-rays (e.g. ASCA)
  Mergers and Dynamics
  Star Formation and the ISM
  Ultraluminous Galaxy Evolution 
  Pushing to High Redshifts (e.g. deep infrared surveys)                    


PRESENTATIONS:  
We expect that oral presentations can be allocated for about half 
of the workshop attendees. Due to time constraints and our desire to 
leave sufficient time for open discussion, some contributions will be 
scheduled as poster presentations. For posters, boards of size 
125cm*150cm are available.  Those authors assigned to posters will 
have the opportunity to present brief poster summaries during 
discussion periods.

PRE-REGISTRATION:

If you wish to attend, we ask that you completely fill out the attached 
form and return it via e-mail to:

		  ulirg@hpgenzel.mpe-garching.mpg.de

The deadline for submissions is February 15, 1998.  The scientific
organizing committee will select the attendees based on the submitted
titles and abstracts within a month of the submission deadline. At that 
time we would urge those accepted participants to make their travel 
arrangements immediately.  The week of the conference is the first week
of the Oktoberfest in Munich and flights fill up months in advance.  Limited 
funding will be available for attendees who require support for travel and 
lodging.  There will be a conference fee of approximately DM 200 which will 
be payable at the workshop.

Further information will be posted and regularly updated on our web site:
