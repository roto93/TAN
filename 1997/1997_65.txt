          "Infrared Spectrum of H3+: A Novel Probe for Plasmas
             in Planetary Ionospheres and Molecular Clouds"

An excerpt from "Missing Link Found in Space" (Nature, v.384, p309):
  After more than 15 years of searching, H3+ has finally been detected 
(Geballe & Oka, Nature, v.384, p334). This detection provides the 
most direct evidence yet for the ion-molecule reaction networks that
are believed to drive the chemistry in interstellar molecular clouds.
Nearly all of the trace molecules, such as CO, H2O, OH, CN and CH3CH2OH,
are formed by reactions involving H3+. H3+ controls the entire chemistry
of these clouds, and the chemistry in turn controls how fast the gas can
cool and collapse to form stars.  So an understanding of the chemistry 
is critical to an understanding of star-forming regions.  With the 
detection of H3+, the missing link between ionization and the rest of
interstellar chemistry has been found.
