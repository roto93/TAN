We seek a postdoctoral scientist to conduct research into the circumstellar
and interstellar environment of Supernova 1987A.  The work would include
completed, ongoing and planned observations of SN1987A and its
surroundings, including data from IUE, UIT, ISO, HST and ground-based
observatories, plus preparation for observations with future ground,
airborne and space-based instruments.  Research topics include mapping the
SN's circumstellar nebula and the interstellar medium of the 30 Doradus
region using light echoes, detailing the composition, density and velocity
structure of the circumstellar envelope, analyzing polarimetric and
photometric properties of surrounding dust, measuring the reflected
ultraviolet flux from SN shock breakout, and observing interaction between
the SN ejecta and circumstellar envelope during the formation of Supernova
Remnant 1987A.

We seek excellent candidates practiced in some of the above observational
techniques and knowledgeable concerning circumstellar and interstellar
processes.  The person selected will study these problems as well as to
develop her/his own related investigations, with support for observation,
publication and professional travel.  This funded position is available for
one year with the possible extension to up to three years, starting in
mid-to-late 1998.  Applicants should provide a curriculum vitae, summary of
research, and names of three colleagues willing to write letters of
reference, by 2 February 1998 to the address above.
