                    Numerical Astrophysics 1998

                        March 10 - 13, 1998

           National Olympic Memorial Youth Center (NYC)
                           Tokyo, Japan

   National Astronomical Observatory,  Japan will hold  an international
meeting  on  the numerical astrophysics.  The aim  of the meeting  is to
explore recent advances in astrophysics aided  by numerical simulations.
In the last decade  numerical simulations  have grown up as a major tool
for astrophysics. Numerical simulations have given us invaluable inform-
ation on complex systems and physical processes under extreme conditions
which  can  be  obtained  neither  by experiments  nor  by observations.
Computers could work as telescopes for theoretical astrophysics.  In the
conference  we will discuss  how numerical simulations have expanded our
understanding  on  astrophysics  and  explore  frontiers  opened  up  by
numerical simulations.  The subjects of the meeting cover all the astro-
nomical objects  from  the  large-scale  structure  of  the universe  to
planet. The meeting consists of invited review talks, contributed talks,
poster papers, and video displays. Various simulations will be presented
including hydrodynamical simulations, magnetohydrodynamical simulations,
particle  simulations  of  gravitational  N-bodies  and  simulations  of
electromagnetic particles. We will discuss also the numerical techniques
on simulations  and  computer technology available and useful for astro-
physical simulations.

  The conference would consist of the following sessions: 

*Astrophysics oriented sessions
  -Cosmology
      (galaxy formation, formation of large-scale structures)
   -Galaxy
      (interacting galaxies, active galactic nuclei, galactic evolution)
   -Star and Planet Formation
      (gravitational collapse, proto-planetary disk)
   -Accretion Disk and Jets
   -Supernovae, Neutron Stars, and Black Holes
   -Solar and Stellar Atmosphere/Interior
   -Solar System (solar wind, planetary magnetosphere)

*Computer Science oriented sessions
   -Numerical Methods
      (hydrodynamics, magnetohydrodynamics, radiation hydrodynamics,
       self-gravitating system, general relativity)
   -Scientific Visualization
   -Computer Technology Useful for Numerical Simulations

--------------------

   The conference site  has  lodgings  available  for  participants  and
accompanying persons.   The lodging is  not luxurious but convenient for
attending  the conference.   Room charge  is  about 4,500  Japanese  YEN
(approximately 40 USD) per person  per night.   The room charge does not
include breakfast  but this is less expensive in Tokyo.  The details for
hotel accommodation will be given in later circulars.

Subject: Post Doctoral Research Fellowship

AAO/ATNF POST DOCTORAL RESEARCH FELLOWSHIP

Applications are invited for an Anglo-Australian Observatory/Australia
Telescope National Facility (AAO/ATNF) post-doctoral research
Fellowship. The AAO/ATNF Fellowship will be tenable for up to two years
from October, 1997. The AAO operates optical telescopes at
Siding Spring, near Coonabarabran, NSW, while ATNF operates radio
telescopes at Narrabri and Parkes. Both have a substantial scientific
staff at their laboratories on a shared site in Epping, about 25km from
the centre of Sydney. 

The recipient of the Fellowship will be expected to conduct a research
program which would exploit the facilities of either or both
institutions, which include the newly-commissioned Multibeam HI receiver
at Parkes and the 2dF multi-object fibre spectroscopy facility on
the Anglo-Australian Telescope. The research could be conducted
independently or in collaboration with AAO and/or ATNF staff
astronomers. The appointee will be expected to participate in the
operation of the observatories and to divide their time roughly equally
beteeen the two institutions. The Fellowship salary will be in the range
$A37,981 to $A40,770 p.a., depending on research experience.
Reasonable relocation expenses including airfare to Australia (and
return on completion of the appointment) will be paid. 

Applications should include a curriculum vitae, list of publications, a
statement of proposed research programmes and the names and
addresses of three referees familiar with the applicant's work. Closing
date 15 August, 1997. 

Prospective candidates should apply in writing to:
The Personnel Officer 
Anglo-Australian Observatory 
PO Box 296 
Epping, NSW 2121 
Australia
