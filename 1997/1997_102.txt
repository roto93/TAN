Top astrophysicist dies in plane crash

BYERS --- A University of Chicago vice president died when his twin-engine 
palne crashed into a field about 10 miles east of Denver on Friday night.

David N. Schramm, 52, a world-renowned astrophysicist, was the only person 
on the plane, Arapahoe county sheriff Pat Sullivan said Saturday.

Schramm was the vice president of research at the University of Chicago and a
Louis Block Distinguished Service Professor in the Physical Sciences.

Sullivan said Schramm left Midway Airport in Chicago for his second home in
Aspen on Friday afternoon.  He stopped to refuel the plane, a Swwearaingen
SW-3, at Front Range Airport in Watkins.

About 7:55 p.m., Schramm took off again for Aspen, where his wife was 
waiting for him.

About 10 minutes later, Schramm radioed the control tower to report his
plane was stalling.  Radar showed him at an altitude of 10,000 feet.

"The next sweep of the radar showed him at 7,000 feet, and the next sweep
of the radar, he was gone." Sullivan said.

At 8:16 p.m., the sheriff's department began receving phone calls from area 
residents and motorists about an explosion and fire a mile north of 
Interstate 70.

Authorities identified the plane with help from Schramm's wife, who 
telephoned with the tail number.

Saturday morning, investigators from the Federal Aviation Administration 
and the National Transportation Safety Board began examining the wreckage
to determine why the plane crashed.  The wreckage was strewn over an
area about a half-mile long and 200 feet wide.

The plane crashed about 4 1/2 miles east of Byers.  It was foggy, and the
temperature was in the 20s at the time of the crash, Sullivan said.

"The odds are reall good that it's icing, but it's going to be the 
NTSB's call" Sullivan said.

Schramm joined the University of Chicago faculty in 1974.  He was a 
world leader in theoretical astrophysics and a leading authority on the 
"Big Bang" model of the formation of the universe.

Physicist Stephen Hawking called Schramm's death "a great loss."

"All I can say is that David was larger than life in many ways," Hawking
said in a written statement.  "His death is a great loss for physics,
his friends, and the Aspen Center for Physics."

Micheal Turner, chairman of the university's astronomy and astrophysics 
department, agreed.

"Dave was one of the giants of modern cosmology, and a towering figure in 
astrophysics," he said.  "He was also a tireless proponent of the importance
of basic scientific research."
