Hi,

Sorry for disturbing you. Just to let you know a big event in Cosmology 
taking place in UK --- the official COSMOS launch. COSMOS is a new UK 
Cosmology Supercomputer, shared by many cosmology groups in this country.
The official COSMOS launch event is now scheduled for Monday May
19th in DAMTP, Cambridge, starting at 10am and finishing at about 1pm.

The concept of a national cosmology supercomputer continues to capture
the public's imagination with sustained press interest here.  There have
been further articles in the Sunday Times, the Times, PC Week etc
(beyond the many previously reported), and BBC World Service TV and
Radio have both done features on COSMOS.

COSMOS has now been set up in our group already, and my supervisor is 
currently the Director of this scheme. Any enquiry or discussion is 
welcome. For further information, please check:

	Best,
		Proty
