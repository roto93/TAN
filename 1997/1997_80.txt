November 26, 1997

Dear Colleague:

This summer's Congressional Budget season has concluded with a
monumental result for Space Science.  The Congress has accepted 
the Administration's proposal for a new Origins Initiative in Space 
Science and has approved the funding augmentation required to start 
the proposed new programs in the FY 1998 budget.

Just one year ago, NASA was working with the National Academy of
Science and the White House to develop the science goals and 
program content for the "Origins" initiative in Space Science.  
The President had just released his new Civil Space Policy in 
September 1996 containing specific directives to NASA relevant to 
Space Science.   In October 1996, the Space Studies Board conducted 
its Space Science Workshop and produced a report for the Vice President.  
The Vice President then conducted his own workshop on Space Science 
with selected members of the science community on December 11, 1996.  
The outcome of all this activity was the new Origins program content in 
the President's FY 1998 budget proposal for NASA submitted to Congress 
in February 1997 which the Congress has now approved and the President 
has signed.  

Another result of the FY 1998 Congressional budget process was the
extraordinary support for the future of Space Science.  The VA, HUD 
and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act which funds NASA contains
specific language regarding Congressional expectation that the
Administration submit an FY 1999 budget which fully supports the
outyear runout for Space Science contained in the FY 1998 Congressional 
budget.  At the same time, however, the Congress and Administration 
reached an agreement on a balanced budget for the Nation by 2002.  
This agreement is not compatible with the outyear runout of the Federal 

FY 1998 budget and will require significant outyear reductions across
the Federal Government.  The budget pressures will not ease, and the
new programs for Space Science in our Strategic Plan will continue to
be a fiscal challenge in the future.   We must continue to demonstrate
the value of Space Science to the Nation by delivering--both on time
and on budget--the quality science that the public has come to expect. 
  
The Congress also added language to the Appropriations bill which
requires Space Science to consolidate its Advanced Technology
Development (ATD) activities into a single budget line and to broadly
compete 75 percent of all ATD funds.  Since the dissolution of NASA's
Technology Office last year and the acquisition of some of its
technology programs by Space Science, we have been restructuring the
entire Space Science technology program including the processes by
which we make funding decisions.  We agree wholeheartedly with the
intent of the Appropriations Committees in the appropriate use of
competition in making funding decisions for ATD.  

Therefore, we will be working to establish the appropriate balance in
Space Science between directed technology development to enable
approved missions at the promised cost, maintenance of core
capabilities at the Centers to carry out the development of these
missions, and broadly competed advanced technology development (ATD). 
To assist the Office of Space Science in this process, we will be
conducting an internal Agencywide review; and, also, we will be seeking
advice from the National Academies of Sciences and Engineering and from
other Federal Agencies involved in technology development.  

Fiscal Year 1998 initiates a significant change in the future for Space
Science and constitutes a healthy start in realizing the vision and
missions articulated in the new Space Science Strategic Plan to be
published early next month.  We should all be grateful to our champions
in the Administration, the Congress, and the public who have responded
so positively to the exciting things we are doing in Space Science and
who have all supported us in making this possible.  We must now work to
ensure that this vision for the Nation is maintained as we proceed
through the continuing difficult fiscal years ahead.  


Sincerely, 


Wesley T. Huntress, Jr.

Associate Administrator 
  for Space Science
