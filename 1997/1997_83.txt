Dear colleague,

You are invited to participate in the Fourth Annual SIRTF Science 
Workshop being held on January 7 from 8-10 pm in the Georgetown Room 
at the AAS meeting. SIRTF has taken enormous strides during the last year 
with such key milestones as passing its Preliminary Design Review 
and the selection of Tom Soifer to lead the SIRTF Science Center located 
at IPAC. SIRTF is on track for a launch in December, 2001, and the project 
is funded to begin construction in 1998. Please join us on the 7th to 
participate in discussions of the SIRTF Science Program, how you would 
like to use the 75% of SIRTF's observing time that belongs to the 
community, and how the Science Center can be most effective in helping 
you achieve your science goals with SIRTF. A preliminary agenda for the 
Workshop is attached below. If you are unable to make this workshop, we 
hope that you will attend "Astrophysics of IR Surveys: A Prelude to 
SIRTF" to be held at CalTech, June 22-24, 1998.

Sincerely,


Bob Gehrz				Marcia Rieke
SIRTF Community Task Force Chair	SIRTF Outreach Coordinator
