The 1997 annual meeting of the Chinese Astronomical Society will be
held on April 13, Sunday, at the Institute of Astronomy, National
Central University.  Members should have, or soon will have, received
the meeting announcement.  You are cordially invited to participate
in this event.

The morning will be shined by two Suns as invited speakers.
Sun Kwok (IAA) will talk on "Astronomy from Space",
accounting his personal experience in the development on modern
ground-based and space astronomy in the last two decades.  He has
been asked, and agreed upon, to speak in Chinese.

Wei-Hsin Sun (NCU) will talk on "Solar Eclipse, Comet, and Helong River",
sharing the memoir of his trip to the northernmost village in China
to spot the magnificent celestial display in early March.

The afternoon is devoted to contributed presentations, with posters and
two parallel oral sessions (scientific and educational respectively).
You are *encouraged* to contribute either a 15-minute talk or a poster
(or both) so we all get to know what you have been doing.
A total of 6 slots have been scheduled in each oral session.  Staff
from the newly established Taipei Astronomical Museum and Natural
Sciences Museum will brief us on their recent programs and future
plans.

So do come and join us for this exciting, one-day event. Title and Abstract 

of your contribution (specify oral or poster) should forward to either
