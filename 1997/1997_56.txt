Subject: Why Do We Need a Strong Astronomy Program?  Another Aspect

For almost three years, I have been follwoing the VSOP (the VLBI Space
Observatory Programme) newsletter from Japan.  The newsletter is 
widely circulated among astronomers worldwide.  However, every once
a while it contained messages like:
===
[Number 40, 7th July 1996]
TANABATA
 
July 7th is `Tanabata', or the star festival, in Japan. It is said that on
this one night of the year a couple of lovers on opposite sides of the Milky
Way, Vega (wife) and Altair (man), meet!
The just-married Phil Edwards returns to Japan this week: his wife, Leanne,
will follow next month. This delayed `Tanabata' will bring them together in
the same side of the Galaxy, and, more specifically, the same side of the
globe, but hopefully for more than just one night!

[Number 68, 25th July 1997]
TANABATA
 
July 7th is `Tanabata', the star festival, in Japan. Japanese tradition has it
that on this one night of the year a pair of lovers forced to reside on
opposite sides of the Milky Way are allowed to meet. The stars Vega and Altair
represent Orihime (the weaving princess) and her lover Hikoboshi, respectively.
These latter two names have also been chosen by NASDA (Japan's National Space
Development Agency) as the names for two satellites that will be used to
attempt the first docking of unmanned space vehicles via Earth-based remote
control. Closer to home, we are pleased to report that the recently-married
George Moellenbrock has returned to Japan with his wife, Karen. The two will be
allowed to see each other for more than just one night per year!

[Number 72, 19th September 1997]
TYPHOONS

September and October are traditionally typhoon season in Japan, though this
year the typhoons started arriving as early as late June! Earlier this week
Typhoon no. 19 headed towards Kyushu, causing fears that the 20m antenna used 
for commanding HALCA and other ISAS satellites might be put out of action by 
the high winds. Indeed, one tracking pass was lost due to the typhoon, but the
next day commanding was able to be carried out and co-observing with the EVN 
went ahead as scheduled. The word `typhoon', by the way, is derived from two 
Chinese characters: `tai', meaning great, and `fung' meaning wind. The word
has been slightly modified in Japanese and is pronounced `taifuu'. 
===

It give us another good reason (other than science:-) to build up a strong
astronomy project of our own.
