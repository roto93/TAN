Dear Astronomers and Astrophysicists,
 
An email network (TAN: Taiwan Astronomy Network) has been set up for all
professional astronomers/astrophysicists in Taiwan or related to Taiwan.
The aim of this network is to increase the communication among us in an
informal way.  TAN acts just like a real-time open forum and your messages
will be distributed to all subscribers automatically.  A good example of the 
usuage of TAN is information exchange.  As mentioned, this is not an 
official network, so feel free to bring up anything you think is relevant
to astronomy in Taiwan.

If you are interested in subscribing it, please email
		kuan@sinica.edu.tw
for details.  Please give a short description of your professional
background.  Graduate students in astronomy/astrophysics/physics programs
are also welcome.

Comment?  Suggestion?  PLEASE PASS THE WORDS OF THE EXISTENCE OF TAN TO
PEOPLE YOU THINK WHO SHOULD BE INCLUDED.  To keep TAN alive, active 
participation from all subscribers are needed.  Please GIVE IT A TRY!
Hope we can hear from you very soon.
