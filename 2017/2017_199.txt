Speaker:    James Simpson (ASIAA)
Topic:         S2COSMOS: First results from an EAO survey to unveil 1200 sub-mm sources in the COSMOS field with SCUBA-2
Time:         12/11 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:         R1203


*** Special Seminar ***

Speaker:    Daisy Leung (Cornell University)
Topic:         The Interstellar Medium and Gas Dynamics of High Redshift Dusty Star-Forming Galaxies and Quasars
Time:         12/11 (Monday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
Gas-rich star-forming galaxies are the main contributors to the buildup of stellar and black holes masses in the Universe, which took place rapidly between the redshift of z=1-3. Both star formation and active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity are related to the gas content and the dynamics of their host galaxies, which in turn shape their subsequent evolution to the present epoch. In this talk, I will present our recent findings in characterizing the interstellar medium (ISM) of dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFG) and powerful quasars using multi-wavelength photometry and CO- and [CII]- line imaging obtained with telescopes such as ALMA, VLA, PdBI, and SMA. In particular, I will focus on our findings of the most massive z~3 "main-sequence" disk galaxy discovered in the rare sample of IR-luminous galaxies at the peak epoch of cosmic star formation using the Herschel Space Observatory. I will conclude with a discussion on the implications of these studies in the context of galax!
y formation and evolution.



*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Anne Dutrey (University of  Bordeaux)
Topic:         ALMA and NOEMA Observations of Disks: deriving Gas and Dust Properties
Time:         12/13 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
Protoplanetary disks of gas and dust encountered around low and intermediate young stars are now recognized as sites of planet formation.  Determining as accurately as possible their physical parameters, such as the temperature and the density, is therefore  fundamental.  So far, our knowledge of these physical parameters remains in many cases model dependent. In the first part of this seminar, I will discuss some recent results we have obtained using ALMA and NOEMA to study the TW Hydra and the Flying Saucer protoplanetary disks.  I will then briefly discuss disk evolution by showing the results of the survey of hybrid disks we have done using the IRAM 30-m telescope and APEX.

Topic:         Cosmology from joint probes of clustering and weak lensing
Time:         12/14 (Thursday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
We live in an exciting time for cosmology. With ongoing imaging surveys such as Dark Energy Survey (DES) and the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) Survey covering increasing volumes of sky, we are now able to explore much more of the large scale dark matter distribution with weak gravitational lensing. Observations of galaxy-galaxy lensing and cosmic shear provide new information on the nature of dark energy and cosmic acceleration by breaking cosmological parameter degeneracies when combined with galaxy clustering. However, the sophistication of our theoretical modelling needs to match the precision of our observations. This will be especially significant for small deviations to the standard model such as massive neutrinos and time variations to the equation of state parameter for dark energy.
>
This talk presents results from one of the first studies from DES involving joint probes of weak lensing and large scale structure. I will also talk about the analysis tools that I have built to supply percent level predictions for highly non-linear quantities such as the halo bias and mass function using a large suite of N-body simulations including dynamical dark energy and massive neutrinos.

1st Announcement

14th European VLBI Network Symposium and Users Meeting

Granada, Spain, 8-11 October 2018

http://EVNSymp2018.iaa.es

The 14th European VLBI Network (EVN) Symposium and Users Meeting will be =
hosted by the Instituto de Astrof=EDsica de Andaluc=EDa-CSIC in Granada =
(Spain) on behalf of the EVN Consortium Board of Directors. The meeting =
will take place on October 8-11, 2018 at the main auditorium of the =
Parque de las Ciencias of Granada, the science museum of the city, =
within walking distance from the historic areas of Granada.

This biannual meeting is the main forum for discussion of the latest =
very long baseline interferometric scientific results and technical and =
technological developments within the EVN member countries. At this =
meeting there will also be a chance for user input into the future =
Science Vision for the EVN.

Topics to be discussed include:

Powerful AGN science
LLAGN, starburst galaxies and extragalactic masers
Stars and planetary systems, supernovae, and stellar masers
Pulsars and non-AGN transient sources
Astrometric, geodetic & space applications
VLBI technology developments
Users feedback
Current and future VLBI facilities and international cooperation
Moreover, the meeting will also focus on the role of EVN on:

Very high-sensitivity VLBI with SKA
Future multi wavelength and multi messenger astronomy including high =
angular-resolution astronomy at other wavelenghts.
The weather and the city environment in Granada is typically excellent =
for the period selected for the conference. A number of social =
activities have been organized, including (among others) a welcome =
reception at Nazari Palace "Cuarto Real de Santo Domingo" (October 7th, =
evening), a visit to the historic Alhambra palaces and gardens (October =
9th, evening), a visit to the IRAM 30m millimeter Radiotelescope =
(October 10th, afternoon; if weather allows), and the conference dinner =
in the historic rooms of Palacio de Santa Paula (previously the Santa =
Paula Convent and the Casa Morisca, in the XVI and XII centuries, =
respectively, in October 10th, evening).

Further information regarding the meeting and details about relevant =
dates, the venue, accommodation  and travelling to Granada is available =
on the conference web site at:
