Title: Exploring the 5:1 Neptune Resonance:
        Dynamics, Population, and Origin

Abstract:
The long-term evolution of objects in the outer n:1 resonances with
Neptune provide clues to the evolutionary history of the Solar System.
Based on 4 objects with semi-major axes near the 5:1 Neptune resonance,
we estimate a substantial and previously unrecognized population of
objects, perhaps more significant than the population in the 3:2 (Plutino)
resonance.

Understanding the characteristics and trapping history for
objects in these populations is critical for constraining the dynamical
history of the solar system. The 4 objects detected in the Canada-France
Ecliptic Plane Survey (CFEPS) were classified using dynamical
integrations. Three are resonant, and the fourth appears to be a
resonance diffusion object, part of a population which exited the
resonance through chaotic diffusion.

The dynamical behavior of the known objects, suggests that the
trapping mechanism for the 5:1 resonance is resonance sticking
from the scattering objects. This is consistent with the measured
surface colors of the objects. However, our investigations
of Solar System evolution models show that they do not emplace a
sufficiently large population into this resonance, and the source
of this large population remains unexplained.
