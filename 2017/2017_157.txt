********************************
Call for Proposals of KaVA (KVN and VERA Array) 2018A
Deadline:  1st November, 2018, 08:00 UT
*********************************

Dear Colleagues.

We invite proposals for the open use observations of the KaVA,
http://radio.kasi.re.kr/kava/main_kava.php
a joint VLBI array of
the KVN (Korean VLBI Network) and the VERA (VLBI exploration of Radio
Astrometry).
The joint array consists of three 21-m KVN telescopes and
four 20-m VERA telescopes, with baseline lengths ranging from 300 km to
2300 km.

This open use call will be based on risk-share, and provide VLBI
observations at
22GHz and 43GHz for astronomers in the world.
We support astronomers in the preparation of proposals, scheduling, and
data analysis.
For that reason, for proposers who are not familiar with KaVA, they are
recommended to include
at least one collaborator from VERA or KVN. If it is difficult to find
collaborators
from VERA or KVN, please consult us to find one.
The contact address for the support  is kavaprop (at-mark) kasi.re.kr.

In order to avoid conflict and/or duplication of the targets between open
use proposals
and LPswith existing KaVA Large Programs, proposers are highly recommended
to visit KaVA Large Program (LP) webpage where KaVA LPs and their source
list are presented.
http://radio.kasi.re.kr/kava/large_programs.php

If the open use proposals can not be achieved with the data of LPs,
then they will be accepted as separate open use observations.
Otherwise, we encourage the proposers to collaborate with the science teams
of
the corresponding KaVA LPs.
Observations will be conducted with single polarization (LCP) and 1-Gbps
data rate.
From this call, KaVA will offer a new C2 wideband (128MHz x 2 IFs) mode for
43GHz.
And, at the correlation, an accumulation period of 0.2 sec becomes
available
in the C2 mode observation. Please consult the KaVA status for the details.

The total available observation time is up to 250 hours and the
observations will be
scheduled between 15th January 2018 and 15th June 2018. The maximum
observing
time per proposal is limited to 100 hours.
If requested in the proposals, the observation time can be allocated over a
year,
until 15th January 2019, for this call. But the observation time will be
still limited to 100 hours.
The deadline of submission is at 08:00 UT on 1st November 2017.
Detailed information on the KaVA call-for-proposal can be found in
http://radio.kasi.re.kr/kava/proposal_info.php

ToO opportunity
It is strongly recommended that Target of Opportunity proposals (especially
expected ToO)
are submitted to regular CfP of KaVA.
Unexpected or urgent ToO can be submitted to ask =EA=B0=BEDirector=EA=B0=BD=
s time=EA=B0=BF at any
time.
These proposals must include specific triggering criteria to initiate an
observation.
The ToO is valid for one year when it is approved. The proposals to
Director's time
must be submitted by PDF files using e-mail to kavaprop (at-mark) kasi.re.k=
