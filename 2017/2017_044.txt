Title: Circumstellar Spirals/Shells/Arcs:
        the Messages from Binary Stars

Abstract:
A growing consensus has been developing in the past few decades that
binarity is key in providing an understanding of the morphological
diversities of the circumstellar envelopes (CSEs) surroudning stars
in the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) to Planetary Nebula (PN) phase.
However, despite extensive efforts to detect companions of AGB stars
and the central stars of PNe, the number of detected binaries in
particular with their orbital properties derived are still small.
As a consequence, the possible roles of binaries in the shaping of PN
and in the CSEs of AGB stars have yet to be clarified.

On the other hand, recurrent (ring/spiral/arc) patterns are often found
in the CSEs of AGB stars and the outer halos of pre-PNe and PNe. Such
patterns provide a fossil record and can be used to trace the temporal
history of the mass loss dynamics during the AGB phase. In this regard,
recent molecular line observations using radio interferometric facilities
such as ALMA and JVLA have revealed the spatio-kinematics of such
patterns. Numerical simulations of binary interactions producing
spiral-shells have been extensively developed and are now becoming
increasingly sophisticated, revealing new probes for extracting the
stellar and orbital properties from these patterns.

I will review the recent theoretical and observational investigations
on the circumstellar spiral-shell patterns and discuss their implications
in linking binary properties to the asymmetric ejection events in the
post-AGB phase.

Tea/Discussion Time is followed !  All Welcome !!
