*** Colloquium ***

Speaker:    Wing Ip (NCU)
Topic:         News from Rosetta
Time:         8/2 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
After a long journey, almost as long as the planning period, the Rosetta spacecraft finally reached the target comet, 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, in August 2014. For nearly two years, Rosetta provided close-up looks of a cometary nucleus that came from the time of the solar system formation and a far-away place. In this talk, we will give a summary of some of the major results obtained by different instruments onboard the spacecraft and the Philae Lander. The research results produced by the NCU group will be described in passing.

Speaker:    Shuay-Pwu Patty Ho (Princeton)
Topic:         Review of Techniques for Large Detector Array Packages on ACT for Cosmic Microwave Background
Time:         8/2 (Wednesday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
The cosmic microwave background (CMB) continues to reveal new aspects of the large scale universe. Technologies for ground-based and balloon-borne instruments measuring the polarization of the CMB have been well established and advanced in the last decade. Experience from the current generation of CMB projects indicates that the integration of the cryogenic detector array package, including its multiplexing and readout elements, is critical to the performance of the CMB instrument. The next generation of instruments needed to fully explore the potential of the CMB will require many more detectors than have currently been deployed. 
As the number of detectors per focal plane scales up, improvements and new technologies for large array packaging will be required. In this talk, I will present the concept from ACTPol and Advanced ACTPol for the assembly of large bolometer arrays. I will summarize the possible improvements and limitations anticipated in driving towards large numbers of even higher density detector arrays when comparing to the successes from other CMB projects, keeping in mind the need for faster production rates while maintaining good performance and high yield.


*** Special Seminar ***

Speaker:    Shuay-Pwu Ho (Princeton)
Topic:         Large Millimeter Bolometric Arrays for Cosmic Microwave Background Observations
Time:         8/4 (Friday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
The cosmic microwave background (CMB) continues to reveal new aspects of the large scale universe. For example, current projects are searching for evidence of primordial gravitational waves, for signatures sensitive to the sum of the neutrino masses, and for further understanding of the formation and growth of large structures under the influence of gravity in the accelerating universe. Technologies for ground-based and balloon-borne instruments measuring the polarization of the CMB have been well established and advanced in the last decade. 

Two upgraded bolometric polarimeters on the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), the ACT Polarimeter (ACTPol) and the Advanced ACTPol, have made and will make sensitive measurements of the temperature and polarization in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) with arcminute resolution.  In this talk, I will focus on the instrumentation of these state-of-the-art arrays, especially the Advanced ACTPol ones. I will conclude with the results coming from the two-season cosmological results presented in Louis et al. (2016) and describe the current progress on the all three ACTPol seasons.

> Subject: Frank Shu: TIARA seminar on July 28, Friday at 2:00pm (1F Auditorium)

Dear All,
  We will have a very special TIARA seminar this Friday 28 at 2pm.

  Frank H. Shu (ASIAA, and Astron Solutions Corporation) will give a talk with the title
"Six Decades of Spiral Density Wave Theory"

  The topic is particularly relevant to galaxy structure and protoplanetary disks, and the speaker is particularly relevant to scientific efforts at ASIAA.
  We appreciate the organizers of 5th IAA Interstellar and Circumstellar Medium workshop for their help in arranging the schedule of this special seminar.
  Welcome all to hear this interesting talk,
Ruben

Title: Six Decades of Spiral Density Wave Theory
Time: July 28, Friday, 14:00 - 15:00
Place: 1F Auditorium
Abstract:
The theory of spiral density waves had its origin approximately six decades ago in an attempt to reconcile the winding dilemma of material spiral arms in flattened disk galaxies. Our review of this subject begins with the earliest calculations of linear and nonlinear spiral density waves in disk galaxies, in which the hypothesis of quasi-stationary spiral structure (QSSS) plays a central role. The earliest success was the prediction of the nonlinear compression of the interstellar medium and its embedded magnetic field; the earliest failure, seemingly, was not detecting color gradients associated with the migration of OB stars whose formation is triggered downstream from the spiral shock front.  The reasons for this apparent failure are understood with an update on the current status of the problem of OB star formation, including its relationship to the feathering substructure of galactic spiral arms.  Infrared images can show two-armed, grand design spirals, even when the o!
ptical and UV images show flocculent structures. We suggest how the nonlinear response of the interstellar gas, coupled with overlapping subharmonic resonances, might introduce chaotic behavior in the dynamics of the interstellar medium and Population I objects, even though the underlying forces to which they are subject are regular. We then move to a discussion of resonantly forced spiral density waves in a planetary ring and their relationship to the ideas of disk truncation, and the shepherding of narrow rings by satellites orbiting nearby. The back reaction of the rings on the satellites led to the prediction of planet migration in protoplanetary disks, which has had widespread application in the exploding data sets concerning hot Jupiters and extrasolar planetary systems.  We then return to the issue of global normal modes in the stellar disk of spiral galaxies and its relationship to the QSSS hypothesis, where the central theoretical concepts involve waves with negati!
ve and positive surface densities of energy and angular moment!
um in th
e regions interior and exterior, respectively, to the corotation circle; the consequent transmission and overreflection of propagating spiral density waves incident on the corotation circle; and the role of feedback from the central regions.  Lastly, we discuss how the amplitude modulation predicted for the destructive interference of oppositely propagating waves that form standing wave patterns may have been observed in deep infrared images of nearby spiral galaxies.
