Topic:         Lightning black holes as unidentified TeV sources
Time:         12/18 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes have revealed more than 100 TeV gamma-ray sources along the Galactic Plane, around 45% of them remain unidentified. Nevertheless, radio observations recently revealed that dense molecular clumps are associated with 67% of 18 unidentified TeV sources. We demonstrate that copious TeV gamma-rays can be emitted from rapidly rotating, stellar-mass black holes when they encounter gaseous clouds. Since the general-relativistic effect plays an essential role in this magnetospheric lepton accelerator scenario, the emissions take place in the direct vicinity of the event horizon, resulting in a point-like gamma-ray image. We demonstrate that their gamma-ray spectra have two peaks in MeV-10GeV and 10GeV-TeV, via curvature and inverse-Compton processes respectively, and that the accelerators become most luminous when the mass accretion rate becomes about 0.01% of the Eddington rate.

Topic:         Seeking the Sources of IceCube's Cosmic Neutrinos
Time:         12/18 (Monday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
The IceCube Collaboration has reported their discovery of high-energy
(e_nu > 1 TeV) neutrinos of cosmic origin. Since the original
announcement in 2013, the confidence level of their discovery has
increased to >5-sigma, and the signature of this relatively
hard-spectrum, isotropic or near-isotropic population of neutrinos has
been recovered via multiple event selections. Despite increasingly
energetic efforts, however, no high-confidence source has been
identified for any of the high-energy neutrinos. At Penn State, the
Astrophysical Multimessenger Observatory Network (AMON) has been
pursuing and enabling time-sensitive searches for neutrino
counterparts which might reveal these sources. I will discuss our
efforts, which have included archival analyses, rapid-response X-ray
and UV/optical observations with NASA's Swift satellite, and recently,
multiwavelength studies of a particularly interesting BL Lac-type
blazar, TXS 0506+056. Whatever the nature of the sources emitting
IceCube's cosmic neutrinos, they are some of the universe's
highest-energy particle accelerators, and may also be the long-sought
sources of the highest-energy cosmic rays.

Topic:         The Parabolic Jet from the Spinning Black Hole in M87
Time:         12/18 (Monday) 13:30 - 14:15
Place:         R1107
Abstract:
Recent comprehensive VLBI studies toward M87 give a unique opportunity
for understanding an AGN jet inside the sphere of influence. The structure and
dynamics of the M87 jet are examined by utilizing GRMHD simulations
as well as the steady axisymmetric force-free electrodynamic (FFE) solution.
Quasi-steady, Poynting flux-dominated funnel jets are obtained in our simulations
up to ~ 100 r_g for various black hole spins. The funnel edge is approximately
determined by the following equipartition; i) the magnetic and rest-mass energy
densities and ii) the gas and magnetic pressures along the outermost parabolic
streamline of the FFE solution (Blandford-Payne-type jet geometry), which is
anchored to the event horizon. The Bernoulli parameter (Be) approximately
becomes zero along the funnel edge, providing a physical boundary between
the funnel (Be > 0) and the matter dominated corona/wind (Be < 0). We confirmed
a quantitative overlap between the outermost parabolic streamline in the FFE jet
solution and the edge of jet sheath in VLBI observations at ~ 10^(1-5) r_g,
suggesting that the M87 jet sheath is presumably powered by the spinning black hole.
Our simulations also indicate a lateral stratification of the bulk acceleration
(i.e. the spine-sheath structure) as well as an emergence of superluminal features.
The black hole spin characterizes the jet stagnation (inflow/outflow separation;
Be ~ 0) surface inside the funnel. The limb-brightened feature in M87 could be
associated with the nature of the black hole-driven jet, if the Doppler beaming is a
dominant factor. Our findings can be examined with on-going mm/sub-mm
VLBI (EHT/GLT) projects, giving a clue for the origin of the relativistic jet
at the horizon-scale for the first time.

Topic:         SP_Ace v1.3: a friendly software to measure stellar parameters and chemical abundances
Time:         12/20 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
The big number of spectra collected nowadays by large spectroscopic
surveys (such as LAMOST, APOGEE, RAVE, and others) requires software
for automated analysis.  I present the software SP_Ace, designed to
derive stellar parameters and chemical abundances.  I describe how it
works and show its performance with application on real spectra such
as the ELODIE spectral library and the LAMOST database, with which we
recently performed the analysis of the LAMOST spectra of the first
data release (DR1, paper submitted).  I also discuss some key points
that affect the accuracy of any method of spectroscopic analysis.
