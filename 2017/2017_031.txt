TITLE: Development of Mid-IR High resolution spectrograph toward the observation of interstellar and planetary atmospheric molecules, with preliminary results and future project

SPEAKER: Prof Yasuhiro Hirahara (Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Nagoya University) [|W˘Dj?I?j?C ˘D--i1t?jĄÓDĄÓA]

ABSTRACT:

We developed GIGMICS (Germanium Immersion Grating Mid-Infrared Cryogenic Spectrograph), which operates at N-band (8-13 Łgm in wavelength Łf) with maximum resolving power  R(ĄÝŁf /ŁGŁf) ~ 40,000. A single crystal germanium echelle immersion grating (30 ĄŃ 30 ĄŃ 72 mm) for collimated beam size of 28 mmŁp was fabricated by utilizing ultra precision micro-grinding method coupled with the ELID (ELectrolytic In-process Dressing) technique. We have conducted the astronomical observation of GIGMICS by the Kanata 1.5-m telescope at Higashi-Hiroshima Observatory, Japan. The observation of Venus showed the significant carbon isotope anomaly of CO2 in the Venusian mesosphere for the first time.
        University of Hawaii, Institute for Astronomy has proposed to establish and operate the PLANETS (Polarized Light from Atmospheres of Nearby Extra-Terrestrial Systems) 1.9-m telescope facility located within the Haleakal? High Altitude Observatory Site near the summit of Haleakal? with 3000-m altitude. Just recently, on Mar. 4, 2017, the proposal has successfully passed the environmental assessment by the BLNR (Board of Land and Natural Resources), State of Hawai?i. On receiving the result, the construction of telescope will begin with the scheduled completion in two years later.  GIGMICS shall be set at the Gregorian focus of the PLANETS, and be used for the deep searches for the vibration-rotation spectra of molecules existing in the various astronomical object including (exo-)planetary atmosphere.
