Hi Keiichi,

    Please distribute to the ASIAA community.

Dear Colleagues,

      Following the SAC recommendation #6 of the November report, a
new call for Large Programs (LP) at CFHT will open February 1st 2018.
If you are interested in submitting an LP proposal, you need to
provide a non-binding Letter of Intent (LoI) by February 15 2018. The
letter should contain a brief description of the science to be
proposed, the instruments requested as well as a first order estimate
of the number of nights that you plan to request. These letters are
non-binding so they will not be used for proposal evaluation.

The LoIs can be up to one page in length and are to be sent to CFHT by
email to director@cfht.hawaii.edu.  These letters are an important
step in developing a LP Evaluation Panel. A list of collaborators as
complete as possible is required and the page limit can be exceeded to
provide it.

Please consult the following URLs for more details:
