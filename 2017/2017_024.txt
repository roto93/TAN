Specially Appointed Research Staff at the NAOJ Chile Observatory (Stationed at the Kagoshima University)

The NAOJ Chile Observatory invites applications for a Specially Appointed Research Staff to conduct the research project “ALMA Study of Disk Formation around Protostars” using ALMA data (including archival data). The selected applicant will spend 100% of the time for this project under the supervision of Professor Takakuwa at the Kagoshima University (1-21-35 Korimoto, Kagoshima, Kagoshima Prefecture, Japan). The selected applicant is required (1) to publish one paper using ALMA per year, and (2) to submit one ALMA proposal per year. The selected applicant may supervise students for the purpose of carrying out this project.

for further information.

The candidate must have a Doctoral degree (PhD) or equivalent in a relevant field. The selected applicant will be employed by the NAOJ, and will be stationed at the Kagoshima University. In case the PI of the project (Prof. Takakuwa) moves to another university or institute, the selected candidate is expected to accompany the PI. However, if such an arrangement is deemed difficult by the new university/institute, the selected candidate will be relocated to NAOJ in Mitaka and continue the proposed research project.

In principle, the term is for two years from the starting date. NAOJ will conduct a review based on the mid-term performance report submitted by the PI and may extend the term for an additional year. For a researcher who has been employed by NINS (National Institutes of Natural Sciences) after April 1, 2013, his/her term will be set so that the total employment period from April 1, 2013 will be less than 10 years.

The starting date is negotiable, but must be between April 1st 2017 and March 31st 2018.

Interested candidates should prepare the documents in English, convert them to PDF (max 10MB per email) and send them to the e-mail address with a subject line “Application for ‘ALMA Study of Disk Formation around Protostars’”. Please contact us if you do not receive a reply within two working days.

(1) Cover letter with the title of the research project.

(4) PDF of three relevant papers
(5) Statement describing your commitment and plans for the job
(6) Two or more reference letters (must be sent directly to the e-mail address, before the deadline.)
