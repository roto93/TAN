Topic:          The impacts of cosmic ray heating on star formation in high-redshift galaxies
Time:           4/6 (Thursday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Young galaxies with strong star formation activity are likely sources of
cosmic ray particles. At high-energies, these particles interact with
the baryon and radiation fields of the galactic environment via
hadronuclear, photo-pair and photo-pion processes to produce charged and
neutral pions, neutrons and protons. At lower energies, they can
interact by collisional ionization. In both cases, the effect is to
drive a heating process in the interstellar medium and beyond. The
distribution of this heating effect is governed by the galactic magnetic
field in the case of low-energy cosmic rays which effectively become
‘locked’ and diffuse predominantly along field lines. At high-energies,
the cosmic ray heating is governed more strongly by the multi-phase
interstellar density field, with the particles being more freely able to
diffuse throughout the magnetic field. This talk addresses the
interactions between these low and high-energy particles and the
partially ionised gases and dense molecular clouds in starbursting
protogalactic environments. We calculate the energy deposited by cosmic
rays as they propagate in and around their host galaxy and demonstrate
how this affects the thermal conditions and star formation in the host
galaxy and its neighbours.
