Dear Colleagues, 

You are cordially invited to attend the Joint Colloquium which will be held on May 22.

The Joint Colloquium Series is organized by the NTU Physics Department, Center for Condensed Matter Science (CCMS), Leung Center for Cosmology and Particle Astrophysics (LeCosPA), Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA), the Institute of Atomic and Molecular Sciences (IAMS), and the NTNU Physics Department.

This Joint Colloquium is also one of the series talks of The Third KAGRA International Workshop (KIW3), which is aims to promote active collaborations from international communities of Gravitational Wave and related physics. KIW3 will be held at Academia Sinica (NTU campus), from May 21-22. For more information, please see KIW3 website.

ASIAA/CCMS/IAMS/LeCosPA/NTU-Physics/NTNU-Physics Joint Colloquium


Time : 5/22 (Mon) 13:30 - 14:30
Place : 1F Auditorium, Astronomy-Mathematics Building, NTU/AS
Speaker: Professor Gabriela Gonzalez  
(Department of Physics & Astronomy, Louisiana State University)


Topic :

Searching for ¡V and finding! gravitational waves

Abstract:

On September 14 2015, the two LIGO gravitational wave detectors in Hanford, Washington and Livingston, Louisiana registered a nearly simultaneous signal with time-frequency properties consistent with gravitational-wave emission by the merger of two massive compact objects. Further analysis of the signals by the LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo Collaboration revealed that the gravitational waves detected by LIGO came from the merger of a binary black hole system. This observation, followed by another one in December 2015, marked the beginning of gravitational wave astronomy. I will describe some details of the observation, the status of LIGO and Virgo ground-based interferometric detectors, and prospects for future observations.


Brief Bio:

Prof. Gonzalez has been a member of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration since 1997, and in 2011 she was elected as its spokesperson. Her group is involved with the characterization of the noise in the LIGO detectors, the calibration of the detectors, and the analysis of the data. In analyzing the data, she searches for the waves produced by binary systems of compact stars in their final orbits before coalescing into a single black hole.

Prof. Gonzalez is a Fellow of the American Physical Society and has won numerous honors and awards, including the Edward A. Bouchet Award of the American Physical Society, Jesse W. Beams Award of the Southeastern Section of American Physical Society, Gruber Cosmology Prize of the International Astronomical Union, Manne Siegbahn Medal from AlbaNova University Center (Stockholm), the 2017 Rossi Prize from AAS, etc. Most notably, Prof. Gonzalez has been selected as Nature¡¦s 10 People Who Mattered This Year in 2016.
