1st Announcement

Star Formation in Different Environment (SFDE) 2017:
    from Local Clouds to Distant Galaxies

International Center for Interdisciplinary Science and Education
   in Vietnam (ICISE), Quy Nhon, Vietnam, 6 - 12 August 2017

http://rencontresduvietnam.org/conferences/2017/sfde2017/


Building upon the success of the SFDE16 conference held in ICISE, Quy
Nhon, Vietnam, we will get together again in 2017 to discuss about the
recent progress in star formation from local clouds to distant galaxies.
The conference will highlight the recent advances in wide-field and high
resolution surveys and detail numerical simulations of star formation in
different environments, from individual star to galaxy systems. The idea
is to search for a universal picture of star formation across all scales
and also identify the characteristics of each individual scale.

The goal of the conference is to share the different views from
different research communities by balancing contributions from different
categories and to encourage collaborations between researchers across
the Globe. Depending on the demand, we might continue as SFDExSeries in
the next years. Focus group meetings also allow more specific topic
discussion. Ample time is set aside to encourage discussions and
collaboration.



Deadlines:
- Oral abstract submission deadline: 30 April, 2017
- Poster abstract submission deadline: 30 April, 2017
- Early registration deadline: 06 Jun, 2017
- Final registration deadline: 16 July, 2017

The number of participants will be limited to around 80, so that all
participants will be accommodated in the same hotel Seagull. Priority
will be given to speakers and poster presenters and early registration
participants.

Registration fee is 350 USD (early bird) or 420 USD (normal).
Accommodation + meal (breakfast, lunch, dinner) fee for the entire
conference duration (6 nights) is 450 USD for a single room and 315 USD
per person for a double room.



Conference venue

The conference will be organized at the International Center for
Interdisciplinary Science and Education in Vietnam (ICISE) by Rencontres
du Vietnam, a scientific non-profit organization. The venue is located
at a beautiful beach in Vietnam, thus allowing participants also to
enjoy the nature, culture while having rich scientific discussion. ICISE
in the city of Quy Nhon (Central Vietnam) has the ambitious objective to
focus on developing science and education, helping young Asian students
and scientists to meet with the international science community,
bringing the opportunity to accelerate their knowledge by attending
lectures and sharing ideas with overseas high-level counterparts.
