Topic:         Internal share archive of ALMA data
Time:         8/21 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
Beside the regular PI projects of ALMA, one can also utilize the public ALMA data for his/her own research.
In this talk, I will present the motivation why we need an interval share data archive and the plan.



*** Colloquium ***

Speaker:    Mike Barlow (UCL)
Topic:         Observations of Supernova Dust and Molecules
Time:         8/23 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
Although a number of models for the formation of dust in the ejecta of 
core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) had predicted that between 0.1 and 1.0 
Msun of dust could be formed per event, it was not until the 2009-2013 
Herschel mission that direct observational evidence was obtained for the 
presence of such large masses of dust in several young supernova remnants, 
including Cas A, the Crab Nebula and SN 1987A. High angular resolution 
submillimetre observations of SN 1987A with ALMA subsequently confirmed 
that its cold dust emission originated from the inner expanding ejecta. 
The presence of dust in CCSN ejecta can also be diagnosed and quantified  from red-blue asymmetries in their late-time optical emission line profiles. I will summarise current results for SN dust masses based on these methods. >
The ALMA observations of the ejecta of SN 1987A also revealed strong CO and SiO rotational line emission. Broad CO line emission has also been detected from the reverse shock region of Cas A, while ArH+ (argonium) rotational lines were first detected by Herschel from the Crab Nebula. These molecular lines have opened up the possibility of measuring supernova isotope ratios for the first time.



*** Special Seminar ***

Speaker:    Roger Wesson (UCL)
Topic:         The abundance discrepancy problem in planetary nebulae
Time:         8/24 (Thursday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
The abundances of heavy elements in planetary nebulae reveal the evolutionary past of the central star, and the future of the interstellar medium, but suffer from a major systematic uncertainty: abundances derived from emission lines formed by recombination exceed those from collisionally excited lines by a factor ranging from ~2 to nearly three orders of magnitude in the most extreme case. The discrepancy has been known since the 1940s but only now are its causes being tracked down. There is now substantial evidence for the presence of cold hydrogen-deficient material within the normal hydrogen-rich gas of planetary nebulae, which gives rise to strongly enhanced recombination line emission. > 
It has recently become clear that the most extreme abundance discrepancies occur in nebulae which have a close binary central star. I will discuss my recent work which has doubled the sample of nebulae with a close binary central star and known chemistry, placing new constraints on the origin of hydrogen deficient material and the cause of the abundance discrepancy.
