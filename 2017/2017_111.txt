Announcement:=20
The Korea ALMA group and the Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute =
(KASI) are pleased to announce the East Asian (EA) ALMA Science Workshop =
2017-Korea. This is the annual meeting of the EA ALMA community =
involving Japan, Taiwan, and Korea. Since being started in 2014 in =
Korea, completing the circle around (2015 Japan and 2016 Taiwan), this =
year it will be held back in Korea, on November 27-29, 2017.

KASI welcomes all the participants of the EA ALMA Science Workshop =
2017-Korea, those who have been carrying out ongoing ALMA projects and =
plan to propose and/or utilize ALMA observations in the near future. The =
meeting would be an ideal starting point to promote a new collaboration =
timely for the next proposal call. Daejeon is located around the middle =
of South Korea, and KASI is the astronomical hub of the Korea =
astronomical community, where you can see various activities for the =
future of the Korea astronomy. In order to maximize all the three =
aspects of updating the current ALMA sciences, sharing our science =
results, and promoting our future projects, this meeting will consist of =
review sessions, parallel sessions for Galactic and external galaxy =
sciences, and discussion sessions. Any astronomers who are interested in =
ALMA, regardless of having their own ongoing ALMA projects or not, are =
strongly encouraged to join the meeting and are most welcomed!
