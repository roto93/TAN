Mineralogical mapping across the main belt, Vesta and Ceres as test cases

From July 2011 to August 2012, Dawn spacecraft orbited around Vesta. It escaped then for Vestan gravitational well and since January 2015 is acquiring data at Ceres. The Visible InfraRed mapping Spectrometer (VIR) mapped Vestan and Cerean surfaces acquiring VIS/NIR spectra (0.5 £gm -5.0£gm) with resolutions ranging from 70m to 800m.
Vesta and Ceres have a completely different composition. Vestan surface is dominated by basalt and is genetically linked to HED meteorites. Ceres on the other hand has on the surface mainly aqueous alteration products like clays and does not have a clear match in the meteorite collection. These two different surfaces are indicative of a different evolutionary path of the two most massive objects of the main belt.
