Speaker:        Andrew Mann (University of Hawaii at Manoa)
Topic:          Tracing Planetary Evolution from Formation to Maturity
Time:           3/20 (Monday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Planets are not born in their final state; rather, they change significantly
over their lifetimes. Understanding how planets evolve has been a central
question since the discovery of the first exoplanets. The first few hundred
million years are thought to be the most formative, but planets in this age
range are also the most difficult to identify and characterize. Instead,
research has focused on inferring the history of planets through patterns in
the population of older systems. In this talk I will discuss how this paradigm
is shifting, as novel search techniques and new missions have enabled our
discovery of Earth- to Jupuiter-size planets as young as 10 Myr. These
discoveries have altered our understanding of how planets migrate and lose
atmosphere, but raise further questions about the physical drivers of these
changes. The upcoming TESS mission will discover hundreds more young planets,
including analogues of a young Earth. Combined with follow-up from new NIR
spectrog!
 raphs (e.g., SPIRou on CFHT, IRD on Subaru), the TESS sample will enable new
tests of planet formation and evolution through population statistics.
Eventually, JWST, SPICA, and 30m-class telescopes can be used to study the
atmospheres of young, rocky planets, providing unique insight into the history
of potentially habitable planets.

Topic:          Imaging Black Holes - Shadows, Accretion and Variability
Time:           3/22 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
In the coming months and years mm-VLBI observations of supermassive black
holes using the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), most notably of Saggitarius A*
and M87, are expected to verify the existence of astrophysical black holes
through detection and measurement of the black hole shadow. Although the
mathematical description of a black hole shadow is straightforward, its
observational appearance is strongly governed by the (thermo)dynamics and
geometrical structure of the surrounding accretion flow. This accretion flow,
particularly on event horizon-scales, is turbulent and time variable, and must
be modelled using general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamical (GRMHD)
simulations. The propagation of radiation and therefore the appearance of
shadow images, spectra and lightcurves are calculated using GR radiation
transport (GRRT). Here we combine GRMHD and GRRT calculations to derive
observational predictions of what upcoming VLBI observations of Sagittarius A*
are expected to obs!
 erve, addressing questions concerning variability therein and also discussing
the possibility of testing the Kerr black hole hypothesis and constraining
other black hole solutions and theories of gravity.

Topic:          Lighting up the Universe with Extreme Supernovae
Time:           3/23 (Thursday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Recent all-sky transient searches have discovered new and unexpected explosion
types
that fall outside traditional SN classification schemes. These exotic outliers
in many cases
are due to the deaths of massive stars and therefore may have been prevalent
in the
primordial universe because the Pop III IMF is thought to be top-heavy.
Depending on the
mass of the progenitor, these outliers may be faint, magnetar-powered,
pair-instability, or
general relativistic instability SNe, all of which have unique observational
signatures.
Some of these events are superluminous, 10-100 times brighter than normal
supernovae,
and may produce energetic UV, X-ray, or gamma-ray bursts. Their extreme
luminosities
enable their detection at z > 10 and they are ideal probes of the primordial
universe at
cosmic dawn, prior to the advent of the first galaxies. Here, we examine these
exotic
explosions with state of the art 3D radiation-hydro simulations that bridge
all spatial scales
from the central engine to breakout into the IGM, where observational
signatures can be
computed. We discuss the coevolution of radiation and turbulent mixing in SN
ejecta
and present realistic light curves for these explosions for JWST and the
coming generation
of extremely large telescopes (ELTs). Detection rates for Pop III SNe can
place useful constraints
on the primordial IMF, and their nucleosynthetic yields can be used to study
the chemical
compositions of extreme metal poor stars.
