Topic:         Magnetic Field Effects on Pulsars
Time:         6/5 (Monday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
Pulsars are fast-rotating neutron stars with strong magnetic fields. Magnetars are an extreme group of pulsars with extraordinarily strong magnetic fields of $10^{14}$--$10^{15}$ G, and remarkable for the bursting activities and high X-ray luminosities powered by their high magnetic field. However, recent discoveries blurred the boundary between magnetars and rotation-powered pulsars (RPPs). In this talk, I will introduce the recent works on the high-magnetic-field RPPs, especially the youngest ones of J1846-0258, J1119-6127, and B1509-58. Young and high-magnetic-field RPPs have surface temperatures between the magnetars and canonical RPPs, indicating that high-magnetic-field RPPs are potential bursters and may contain toroidal magnetic fields according to the magneto-thermal evolution model. This model implies that the toroidal field could play an important role in bursting rate and the temperature anisotropic. Our recent work on the statistics of magnetars' pulse profiles !
agreed on this implication well.  Finally, I will introduce the possible connection between the magnetars and the accreting pulsars in ultraluminous X-ray sources. Toroidal or multi-polar magnetic fields are necessary to interpret the high luminosities and the observed spin-up rates, indicating that ultraluminous pulsars are possibly powered by magnetars.

Topic:         Cosmology with the Large-scale Structures of the Universe
Time:         6/6 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R104, CCMS
Abstract:
In the first part of my talk I will briefly review sciences with the large-scale structures of the universe. In particular, I will introduce how the growing galaxy redshift data can be used to constrain cosmological models and galaxy formation theories.

In the second part a new method for measuring the cosmological parameters governing the expansion history of the universe will be introduced. The method uses the Alcock-Paczynski (AP) test applied to the overall shape of the galaxy two-point correlation function along and across the line-of-sight. We applied this method to simulated data and also to a recent galaxy survey data to obtain an impressive constraint on the dark energy equation of state and matter density parameter Î©m.

Topic:         Satellites of Isolated Early-type Galaxies and the Missing Satellite Galaxy Problem
Time:         6/7 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
The standard galaxy formation scenario in the popular LCDM cosmogony has been very successful in explaining the large-scale distribution of galaxies. However, one of the failures of the theory is that it predicts too many satellite galaxies associated with massive galaxies compared to observations, which is called the missing satellite galaxy problem. Isolated groups of galaxies hosted by massive early-type galaxies are ideal laboratories for finding the missing physics in the current theory.

We discover through a deep spectroscopic survey of galactic satellite systems that bright isolated early-type galaxies have almost no satellite galaxies fainter than the r-band absolute magnitude of about -14. The cutoff in the satellite galaxy luminosity function is at somewhat brighter magnitude of about -15 for early-type satellites. Physical properties of the observed satellites depend sensitively on the host-centric distance. All these are strong evidence that galactic satellites can be significantly affected due to astrophysics of satellite-host galaxy interaction. Previously, the faint end of the luminosity function of satellite galaxies has been measured only for late-type host systems or down to absolute magnitudes brighter the cutoff. Our work expands our knowledge to early-type host systems and down to absolute magnitude much fainter than -14.

A recent state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulation of galaxy formation does not reproduce such a cutoff in the satellite galaxy luminosity function. But the past history of the simulated satellites demonstrates that many satellite galaxies evolve to become fainter than the cutoff magnitude by the present epoch through fatal encounters with the host or other satellite galaxies. This leaves the hope that the missing satellite galaxy problem could be mitigated if the astrophysics of galaxy interaction is more elaborated in the theory.
