Dear Profs. Kuan, Chiueh, and Chen, 

Could you please relay the following message to your colleagues? 
Basically, all are welcome to come to the talks (especially postdocs), 
but we cannot provide lunch boxes. 

cheers,

Dear colleagues, 

ASIAA/TIARA will hold a summer school on astrostatistics and big data 
on 9/4-8 in the 1F auditorium at ASIAA.  Given the overwhelming 
enthusiasm we've received, we tried to accept as many students as 
possible.  As such, we will only be able to provide support (e.g., 
meals, lodging) to registered participants.  Nevertheless, we 
emphasize that everyone is welcome to attend the lectures and the 
tutorial sessions.  Please see the school website 
http://events.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/school/20170904/ 
for the program. 

best regards, 
yen-ting 
for the organizers
