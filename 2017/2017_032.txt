____________________________________________________
Speaker:        Paulo Freire (Max-Planck-Institut fĂźr Radioastronomie)
Topic:          Testing the nature of gravitational waves with observations of binary pulsars
Time:           3/6 (Monday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
In this talk, I will review some of the principles of pulsar timing, and review some of the results from the timing of binary pulsars from previous work. These include the observation of gravitational waves (GWs) in the energy loss of the "Hulse-Taylor" double neutron star, almost 40 years before the LIGO observation. I then introduce ongoing work, which tests the emission of GWs with far more accuracy than in the Hulse-Taylor pulsar, and new detections of the emission of gravitational waves in pulsar-white dwarf systems, which introduce strong constraints on the nature of GWs. In particular, we are able to exclude, within observing precision, any dipolar components of gravitational radiation, showing that they are almost purely quadrupolar. These results are then used for some of the most stringent tests of general relativity and alternative theories of gravity ever accomplished.

Topic:          Aging comets and their meteor showers
Time:           3/7 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Active comets lost a significant amount of volatile every time they
pass through perihelion. As a result, comets will have less materials
for sublimation, and one would expect that comets will continue to fade
as they evolve. However, it is also suggested that the active lifetime
of a comet can consists of multiple active stages separated by temporary
dormant phases, making it difficult to identify true secular fading
caused by aging of comets. The era of modern astronomy is unfortunately
not long enough to cover the typical lifetime of a
comet (usually a few hundred orbits); however, comets produce dust
during their active stages, which are potentially detectable as meteor
activity at the Earth. Here I discuss the effort of understanding
cometary aging by examining different parts of the evolution spectrum of
Jupiter-family comets (JFCs), a group of comets that dominates the
cometary influx in the near-Earth space, using telescopic and meteor
observations as well as dynamical investigation.

Topic:          Localization of the Fast Radio Burst 121102
Time:           3/9 (Thursday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration, highly-dispersed radio wavelength pulses.  Based on their large dispersion measure, FRBs appear to originate from extragalactic distances implying extreme luminosities that are not seen in any galactic sources.  Progress in understanding FRBs has been slow because the discovered events have had >arcminute localization, making association with galaxies or galactic objects impossible.  Currently, there are more theories than FRBs, which number about 20.  I will describe here the first arcsecond localization of an FRB.  Using the Very Large Array (VLA) and other radio telescopes, we have shown that FRB 121102 is associated with a faint persistent radio source and a faint galaxy.  Gemini observations provided the redshift (z~0.2) and identification of the galaxy as a dwarf with significant star formation and low metallicity.  I will discuss the implications of this discovery for our understanding of FRBs and the possibility of u!
 sing FRBs to study the intergalactic medium.
