Topic:         Starlight Reshapes Planetary Nurseries
Time:         10/17 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
Many protostellar disks show central cavities, rings or spiral arms
likely caused by low-mass stellar or planetary companions, yet few
such features are conclusively tied to bodies embedded in the disks.
Even small features on the disk's surface cast shadows, because the
starlight grazes the surface.  We therefore focus on accurately
computing the disk's thickness, which depends on its temperature.  We
present models with temperatures set by the balance between starlight
heating and radiative cooling, and that are in vertical hydrostatic
equilibrium.  The planet has 20, 100, or 1000 Earth masses, ranging
from barely enough to perturb the disk significantly, to clearing a
deep tidal gap.  The hydrostatic balance strikingly alters the model
disk's appearance.  The planet-carved gap's outer wall puffs up under
starlight heating, throwing a shadow across the disk beyond.  The
shadow appears in scattered light as a dark ring that could be
mistaken for a gap opened by another planet.  The surface brightness
contrast between outer wall and shadow for the 100-Earth-mass planet
is almost an order of magnitude greater than a model neglecting the
temperature disturbances.  The shadow is so deep it largely hides the
planet-launched spiral wave's outer arm.  Temperature gradients are
such that outer low-mass planets undergoing orbital migration will
converge within the shadow.  Furthermore, the temperature
perturbations affect the shape, size and contrast of features at
millimeter and centimeter wavelengths.  Thus, starlight heating and
radiative cooling are key factors in the appearance of protostellar
disks with embedded planets.

Speaker:    Sergei A. Levshakov (A. F. Ioffe Physical-Technical Institute)
Topic:         Probing the fundamental constants of nature over cosmological time-scales
Time:         10/19 (Thursday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
The measurements of the fundamental constants of nature - the fine structure constant, alpha, and the electron-to-proton mass ratio, mu - using astronomical spectra of atoms and molecules are reviewed. The current results obtained from observations of dark clouds in the Milky Way, HII zones in the neighbouring galaxy M33, and high-redshift galaxies at z ~ 6 are summarized. Prospects for future observations are discussed.
