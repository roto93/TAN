Dear colleague,

Please find below announcement of postdoc opportunities at ASIAA.

best regards,
Yen-Ting Lin

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA) in
Taipei, Taiwan, has openings for postdoctoral positions.  We seek for
candidates (1) to participate in the Institute's projects, including
Subaru HSC and PFS surveys, SDSS-IV, TAOS-2, ALMA, SMA, JCMT, VLBI
with the Greenland telescope, and Y.T. Lee Array; (2) to pursue
theoretical or observational studies of planetary and solar system
science, star and planet formation, galaxy formation, cosmology,
computational fluid dynamics, or MHD; or (c) to participate in
instrumentation development for optical/IR/submm telescopes.

ASIAA has approximately 200 staff, including 41 faculty members.
ASIAA has access to forefront observing facilities including ALMA,
SMA, SMA, JCMT, CFHT, and Subaru Telescope.  We are partners in the
Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) and Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS)
projects, and are a member of the SDSS-IV and LSST Surveys.  The Y.T.
Lee Array on Mauna Loa will conduct intensity mapping of CO rotational
transitions.  The Greenland Telescope will conduct submm VLBI
observations of shadows of supermassive black holes and related
sciences.  The TAOS-2 project will soon conduct a survey of small
objects beyond Neptune via occultation and other time-domain sciences
at San Pedro Mártir. Theoretical and computational astrophysics is
pursued in our theoretical division, TIARA.  The CHARMS project aims
to develop numerical simulators to bridge observations and theories in
fluid dynamics, astrochemistry, and radiative transfer, using
algorithms and techniques utilizing the CPUs and GPUs.  A focus on the
Origins of Solar Systems is being built upon experimental works in our
in-house nanoSIMS facility.  More info on our projects can be found on
ASIAA website (http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/project/).

ASIAA offers excellent research facilities and an international
environment (~55 foreign members from 18 countries), with English
being the working language.  The postdoc appointments will initially
be for two years, with possible extension for additional two years
based on satisfactory performance.

Applicants should hold a Ph.D. degree in astronomy/astrophysics,
physics, engineering or equivalent fields.  Those who are expecting to
receive a PhD degree soon can also apply. Applicants should apply
online (https://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/jobopening/application.php?i=02a16d5f90c3256a2e7e6d1fa44424ca)
and submit:
(1) a curriculum vitae,
(2) a publication list,
(3) a summary of past and current research or instrumentation
experience (limited to 3 pages),
(4) a plan for future research (limited to 3 pages of text, with at
most 2 additional pages for figures and references).
Applicants are also requested to arrange three letters of
recommendation to be submitted online at the same site.  Applications
and three letters of recommendation submitted by or on 15 November
2017 will receive full consideration.

Dear Colleagues.

I attached herewith an announcement of the call-for-proposals of 
the VERA for 2018A season.  
Please distribute this announcement to your community and encourage 
people to write proposals.  

Thank you very much for your cooperation.

Best regards,

K. M. Shibata
Mizusawa VLBI observatory, NAOJ

-------------------------------------------------

********************************
Call for Proposals of VERA
Deadline;  November 01, 2017, 08:00 UT.
*********************************

We wish to inform you call for proposals of VERA; VLBI exploration of
Radio Astrometry.  VERA is a Japanese VLBI network, which has
four 20-m  stations in Japanese archipelago and aims phase referencing
and astrometry observations with 2-beam system.  It makes simultaneous
observations of two objects with the 22-GHz and 43-GHz bands.
VERA, Kashima-34m and Nobeyama-45m network mode is also available.  
Available observation time is up to 200 hours during the observation period 
from January 15th, 2018 to June 15th, 2018.
Although it is limited to VERA array and  a single-beam mode, 
the 6.7 GHz ( C-band ) is opened on shared-risk basis. 

We encourage the submission of many proposals.

For further details please see below,

http://veraserver.mtk.nao.ac.jp/index.html

And any questions should be asked to vera-prop (at-mark) nao.ac.jp

Sincerely,

*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    I-Non Chiu (ASIAA)
Topic:         Studying Cosmology with Galaxy Clusters
Time:         10/11 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
Galaxy clusters contain rich information of cosmology and astrophysics. In the past, cluster science was limited by a lack of adequately deep observations in multi-wavelength and was subject to heterogeneous samples with small sizes at low redshift. The situation has been changed due to the recent success of the large mm wavelength surveys—such as the South Pole Telescope (SPT)—that employ the Sunyaev-Zel’dovich Effect (SZE) to identify and study galaxy clusters in their abundance out to the early and distant Universe. Together with the breakthroughs in the area of wide-and-deep optical and NIR surveys, such as the Dark Energy Survey and the Hyper Suprime-Cam survey, we are able to uniformly study these SZE selected samples. In this talk, I will talk about the recent results from the SPT collaboration with emphasis on various observable to mass scaling relations. I will present the unprecedented study of the baryon content of an approximately mass-limited sample of 91 !
galaxy clusters out to redshift 1.3. I will demonstrate the crucial need for the accurate mass calibration in order to pave a way for cluster science in the future.



*** Special Seminar ***
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Yen-Chen Pan (UCSC)
Topic:         Understanding Type Ia Supernova with UV Spectroscopy
Time:         10/12 (Thursday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
Type Ia Supernovae are exceptionally bright explosions, and their calibrateable brightness makes them critical tools for probing the cosmic expansion. However, their progenitors remain unclear, which could introduce uncertainties in their use in cosmology. Theory suggests that SN Ia progenitor metallicity is correlated with its peak luminosity, but not its light-curve shape. As a result, this effect should lead to an increased Hubble scatter, reducing the precision in distance measurement. Models also indicate that changing the progenitor metallicity will have little effect on the appearance of optical SN data, but significantly change UV spectra. We obtained the sample of SN Ia with UV spectral time series from both Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and Swift satellite. The initial results are presented by comparing the SN and UV spectral features and analyse the dependence of SN properties on metallicity.
