Dear Colleagues in Astronomy and Astrophysics,

The Cross-Strait Symposium of Astrophysics, previously the ASIAA-SHAO
bilateral workshop, will be held in the Institute of Astronomy and
Astrophysics, Academia Sinica, on July 1-3, ending at noon on July 3, to be
followed by the APRIM.

This symposium series alternates between the two sides of the Strait,
hosted by one participating Institution approximately every one and half
year. The activities through hosting symposia aim to promote interactions
of individual research areas of working Astronomers and Astrophysicists,
instrumentation, and theoretical modeling and computational simulations in
Astrophysics, originally motivated by the proximity and complementarity of
Institutions across the Strait. This year, the symposium will take place in
the ASIAA. In addition to colleagues in ASIAA and Universities in Taiwan,
colleagues from University of Science and Technology of China (in Hefei,
Anhui, USTC), the Shanghai Astronomical Observatory, and Principal
Investigators from key laboratories in China will join. Topics to be
discussed and interacted include all major research directions from large
scales to small scales: Cosmology, Black Holes and Active Galactic Nuclei,
Galaxies, Stars, the Solar System, and the Exoplanets, as well as active
instrumentation and telescope accesses. It is anticipated that common areas
and interests with strong and developmental advantages will be identified
and further cultivated through mutual communications and exchanges.

The registration is open through the link here:

We appreciate your participation and the program will be prepared based on
local and mutual interests, and showcases of efforts across the Strait.

Cheers,

Hsien Shang
