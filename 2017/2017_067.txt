Title: Interstellar scintillation as micro-arcsecond
        scale probes of compact radio AGNs

Abstract:

The variability of compact AGNs on timescales of hours and days observed
at cm-wavelengths is predominantly caused by scattering in the ionized
interstellar medium (ISM) of our Galaxy. With the ISM as an AU-scale
interferometer, interstellar scintillation (ISS) provides an exquisite
probe of the micro-arcsecond scale structure of AGNs.

I present results from the Micro-arcsecond Scintillation-Induced 
Variability (MASIV) Survey of ~500 compact AGNs and its follow-up 
observations. I will discuss the dependence of ISS on intrinsic AGN 
properties, including their gamma-ray loudness, radio spectral indices, 
optical spectral classification, redshift, and intrinsic variability.
I will show how we have used ISS to probe the source size-redshift 
relation of compact AGNs, and place strong constraints on the
turbulent properties of the intervening intergalactic medium.

Future surveys of ISS with highly-sensitive instruments such as
the SKA will potentially probe the micro-arcsecond structure of
faint (~100 muJy to 10 mJy) AGNs, thereby complementing studies at 
comparable angular resolutions with Space-VLBI and mm-VLBI which
are limited only to the brightest AGNs.

Tea/Discussion Time is followed !  All Welcome !!
