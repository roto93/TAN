Dear all the GLT related members,

Here we report you that we finally got the astronomical first
light with GLT using the 86 GHz receiver!!!

..

We are pretty happy that we got the first light within 2017,
as we proposed before.  It was the Christmas day here, so we
got a pretty nice Christmas gift :)  Thank you very much for
your helps for a long time, and let's go for the EHT observation!

..


Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!!!
Kevin and Satoki @ Thule

Hi Keiichi,

    Please distribute to the ASIAA community.

Dear Colleagues,

      Following the SAC recommendation #6 of the November report, a
new call for Large Programs (LP) at CFHT will open February 1st 2018.
If you are interested in submitting an LP proposal, you need to
provide a non-binding Letter of Intent (LoI) by February 15 2018. The
letter should contain a brief description of the science to be
proposed, the instruments requested as well as a first order estimate
of the number of nights that you plan to request. These letters are
non-binding so they will not be used for proposal evaluation.

The LoIs can be up to one page in length and are to be sent to CFHT by
email to director@cfht.hawaii.edu.  These letters are an important
step in developing a LP Evaluation Panel. A list of collaborators as
complete as possible is required and the page limit can be exceeded to
provide it.

Please consult the following URLs for more details:
