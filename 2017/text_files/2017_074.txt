Title: Excessive shift of the CMB acoustic peaks
        of the Cold Spot area

Abstract:

Measurement of the acoustic peak positions of the
cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature
anisotropies has been instrumental in deciding
the geometry and content of the universe.
Acoustic peak positions vary from patch to patch 
in different parts of the sky due to statistical
fluctuation.

We present the statistics of the peak positions
of small patches from ESA Planck data. It is found
that the peak positions have significantly high 
variance compared to the 100 CMB simulations with
best-fit LambdaCDM model with lensing and Doppler
boosting effects included, both of which can 
significantly shift the peaks of small patches.

Examining individual patches, we find the one 
containing the mysterious "Cold Spot", an area
near the Eridanus constellation where the
temperature is lower than Gaussian theory predicts,
displays large synchronous shift of peak positions
towards smaller multipole numbers (i.e. larger scales)
with significance lower than 1.11 x 10^{-4}.

The combination of large synchronous shifts in acoustic
peaks and lower than usual temperature at the Cold Spot
area results in a 4.73 sigma detection (significance
p~1.11 x 10^{-6}) against the LambdaCDM model, prompting
us to propose one of the possible accounts for
both anomalies: some localised unknown force to stretch
the space around the Cold Spot area so that the acoustic
peak positions are shifted towards large scales and
the temperature is dragged down.
