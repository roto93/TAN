Dear Yi-Jheng,

The =E2=80=9CCall for Large Scale Proposals for the SMA=E2=80=9D is now =
open.
Please announce this to TAN.

Thank you,
Naomi

Dear Colleague,

We wish to draw your attention to the Call for Large Scale Proposals for =
observations with the Sub-millimeter Array (SMA), which is now open. =
Under this program, proposals dedicated to answering major astrophysical =
questions having significant scientific impact requiring observing times =
of order 100-1000 hours are solicited.

The SMA is a reconfigurable interferometric array of eight 6-m antennas =
on Mauna Kea jointly built and operated by the Smithsonian Astrophysical =
Observatory and the Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and =
Astrophysics. The array operates in the 230, 345 and 400 GHz bands. The =
existing large scale (legacy) program  has been restructured and =
refocused with new guidelines to enhance its efficiency and value to the =
community, leading to the current call.

There is no deadline for proposal submission. Following a phased =
development, submission and review path, the final selection of =
successful proposals is intended to be synchronized with the TAC process =
for regular proposals. Accordingly,  a Notice of Intent is required =
ahead of full submission and well in advance of the call for regular =
proposals.

Questions or comments regarding the Call for Large Scale Proposals can =
be addressed to sma-largescale@cfa.harvard.edu =

Best wishes,
