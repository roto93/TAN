Dear Colleagues.

We invite proposals for the open use observations of the Korean VLBI
Network.

- Call for Proposals 2017B (KVN VLBI)
The Korean VLBI Network (KVN, http://kvn.kasi.re.kr/) invites scientific
proposals for VLBI observations during the 2017B season from Astronomers
over the world. Observations of successful proposals will be scheduled
between 15th August 2017 and 15th January 2018. Proposals should be emailed
to kvnprop@kasi.re.kr before the deadline of UT 08:00 (KST 17:00) on 1st
June 2017.

- Korean VLBI Network (KVN)
The Korean VLBI Network (KVN) is a dedicated mm-VLBI network, operated by
Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute (KASI, http://www.kasi.re.kr).
Its three 21m radio telescopes are located in Seoul, Ulsan and Jeju Island
around South Korea. The baseline lengths ranges from 305km to 476 km. Its 4-
channel receiving system allows simultaneous observation at 22, 43, 86, and
129 GHz. From this call, higher than 1 Gbps recording rates (2, 4 and 8
Gbps)
using Mark6 recorder are available. Total machine time of 300 hours are
planned for this call. The maximum observation time of a proposal will be
limited to 100 hours. If requested in the proposals, the observation time
can be allocated over a year, until June 15, 2018, for this call. But the
observation time will not be increased. Details of the information and
current status of the KVN can be found in the KVN VLBI Status Report.
http://radio.kasi.re.kr/kvn/status_report_2017/array.html
Proposer should fill the KVN VLBI proposal form (tex file can be found at
http://kvn.kasi.re.kr/index.html/obs_proposal.php). Please carefully follow
the instruction of the proposal form. A separate scientific and technical
justification is mandatory. This Justification should be submitted together
with the proposal form and not exceed 3 pages.

Dear All,

LIGOâ€™s first detection of the Gravitational Waves (GW) 
opened a new era of GW astronomy and physics.

We will have the 3rd KAGRA International Workshop (KIW3) 
at ASIAA (NTU campus) on May/21, 22.
KAGRA is an Asian based GW project led by 2015 Nobel laureate, T.Kajita. 

This workshop is open to and welcomes everyone who has interests.

The detailed information and program are available at:
http://grqc.ncts.ncku.edu.tw/KAGRA2017/index.html

Particularly, on the second day (May/22) we will invite distinguished speakers 
on the GW projects such as LIGO, Virgo, KAGRA as well as eLISA PF and other space-based projects.

The talk by Gabriela Gonzalez (Former LIGO Spokesperson):
"Searching for - and finding! gravitational waves"
will be held as ASIAA-NTU special joint Colloquium.
http://web.phys.ntu.edu.tw/colloquium/

It would be great if many from our community can join the workshop and discussions.
For those who are interested, please make a registration at:
http://grqc.ncts.ncku.edu.tw/KAGRA2017/regi.html

On the next day (May/23) there will be another workshop 
Second ASTROD International Workshop (AIW2) at Hsinchu to discuss on the GW detection in space.

Dear Colleagues.

I attached herewith an announcement of the call-for-proposals of 
the VERA for 2017B season.  
Please distribute this announcement to your community and encourage 
people to write proposals.  

Thank you very much for your cooperation.

Best regards,

********************************
Call for Proposals of VERA
Deadline;  June 01, 2017, 08:00 UT.
*********************************

We wish to inform you call for proposals of VERA; VLBI exploration of
Radio Astrometry.  VERA is a Japanese VLBI network, which has
four 20-m  stations in Japanese archipelago and aims phase referencing
and astrometry observations with 2-beam system.  It makes simultaneous
observations of two objects with the 22-GHz and 43-GHz bands.
VERA, Kashima-34m and Nobeyama-45m network mode is also available.  
Available observation time is up to 200 hours during the observation period 
from August 15th, 2017 to January 15th, 2018.
Although it is limited to VERA array and  a single-beam mode, 
the 6.7 GHz ( C-band ) is opened on shared-risk basis. 

We encourage the submission of many proposals.

For further details please see below,

Title: Excessive shift of the CMB acoustic peaks
        of the Cold Spot area

Abstract:

Measurement of the acoustic peak positions of the
cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature
anisotropies has been instrumental in deciding
the geometry and content of the universe.
Acoustic peak positions vary from patch to patch 
in different parts of the sky due to statistical
fluctuation.

We present the statistics of the peak positions
of small patches from ESA Planck data. It is found
that the peak positions have significantly high 
variance compared to the 100 CMB simulations with
best-fit LambdaCDM model with lensing and Doppler
boosting effects included, both of which can 
significantly shift the peaks of small patches.

Examining individual patches, we find the one 
containing the mysterious "Cold Spot", an area
near the Eridanus constellation where the
temperature is lower than Gaussian theory predicts,
displays large synchronous shift of peak positions
towards smaller multipole numbers (i.e. larger scales)
with significance lower than 1.11 x 10^{-4}.

The combination of large synchronous shifts in acoustic
peaks and lower than usual temperature at the Cold Spot
area results in a 4.73 sigma detection (significance
p~1.11 x 10^{-6}) against the LambdaCDM model, prompting
us to propose one of the possible accounts for
both anomalies: some localised unknown force to stretch
the space around the Cold Spot area so that the acoustic
peak positions are shifted towards large scales and
the temperature is dragged down.

Tea/Discussion Time is followed !  All Welcome !!
