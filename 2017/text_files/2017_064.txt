Speaker:    Jesus Toala (ASIAA)
Topic:         X-ray Emission as a probe of Stellar Evolution
Time:         4/24 (Monday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
Very massive stars are the main actors in shaping and chemically enriching the ISM in the 
galaxies we see. They do so by a combination of their stellar winds, proper motions, strong 
ionising photon fluxes, and supernova explosions. These produce cavities in the ISM that can
be studied with X-ray observatories. In this talk I review our current understanding of the 
production of diffuse X-ray emission towards the nebulae carved by massive stellar feedback.


*** Colloquium ***

Speaker:    Ai-Lei Sun (ASIAA)
Topic:         The many facets of AGN feedback -- a multi-wavelength view of galactic outflows
Time:         4/26 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
Active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback is now a standard ingredient in galaxy evolution models. Popular models suggest that during the quasar phase, gas is driven out of the galaxy in the form of outflows, shutting off star-formation and black hole growth, leading to the observed quiescent galaxy population and the black hole -- galaxy correlations, but many assumptions require observational supports. Observations have discovered galactic outflow in the luminous quasar, but their structure is surprisingly complex, involving a wide range of gas phases from cold molecules to hot X-ray emitting gas. Multi-wavelength coverage is needed for a comprehensive picture. I summarize recent optical, radio, and X-ray observations of AGN outflows in nearby luminous quasars, and what do we learn about their occurrence rate, composition, and energetics, as well as the life cycles of AGN feedback. I end with discussing how on-going and future optical surveys could help us study this rare and !
intriguing phenomenon of AGN feedback.
