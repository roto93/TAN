Title: Hydrodynamic processes in planet formation

Abstract:
Planet formation is rapidly developing field in astronomy. We are in
an era of not only regular detections of extra-Solar planets, but
also the planet formation process itself. Recent observations of
protoplantary disks reveal stunningly detailed sub-structures such as
gaps, rings, spirals and lopsided asymmetries. Understanding the
origin of these structures, for example due to unseen planets or
dynamical instabilities, can place constraints on the physical
conditions for planet formation.

I will discuss some works on hydrodynamic processes important to
protoplanetary disk/planet evolution and in explaining observations.
These include gravitational instabilities, vortex formation, and the
vertical shear instability for generating turbulence in disks.
I will also present a new effort to study dusty protoplanetary disks
through a set of modified fluid dynamic equations.

Tea/Discussion Time is followed !  All Welcome !!
