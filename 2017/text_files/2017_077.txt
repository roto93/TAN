*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Kevin Koay (ASIAA)
Topic:         Interstellar scintillation as micro-arcsecond scale probes of compact radio AGNs
Time:         5/10 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
The variability of compact AGNs on timescales of hours and days observed at cm-wavelengths is predominantly caused by scattering in the ionized interstellar medium (ISM) of our Galaxy. With the ISM as an AU-scale interferometer, interstellar scintillation (ISS) provides an exquisite probe of the micro-arcsecond scale structure of AGNs. I present results from the Micro-arcsecond Scintillation-Induced Variability (MASIV) Survey of ~500 compact AGNs and its follow-up observations. I will discuss the dependence of ISS on intrinsic AGN properties, including their gamma-ray loudness, radio spectral indices, optical spectral classification, redshift, and intrinsic variability. I will show how we can use ISS to probe the source size-redshift relation of compact AGNs, and place strong constraints on the turbulent properties of the intervening intergalactic medium. Future surveys of ISS with highly-sensitive radio telescopes such as the SKA will potentially probe the micro-arcsecond s!
tructure of faint (~100 muJy to 10 mJy) AGNs, thereby complementing studies at comparable angular resolutions with Space-VLBI and mm-VLBI which at present are limited only to the brightest AGNs.

Speaker:    Yen, Sheng-Feng (ASIAA)
Topic:         wSMA series: My Baker Life - The LDPE Anti-reflection Coating
Time:         5/10 (Wednesday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
In this talk, I will mention why we need and quartz windows. 
And why using LDPE to reduce the reflection.
How we coated the LDPE ( Low-density polyethylene ) at the quartz surface.
And preliminary result.
