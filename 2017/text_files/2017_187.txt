November 3, 2017

Dear our colleagues, key members of APCosPA Org:

    "The Universe" have been there for almost five years - as a
journal/newsletter for the 21st Century. We have always in mind that the
journal was created for the new century, the 21st Century. Enclosed please
find the current list from the Inspire, the largest particle physics
information system.

    We have created, for the authors of the papers in "The Universe", the
T.D. Lee Prize(s) of "The Universe", giving out once every three years.
The prize carries US3,600$ plus round-trip travel to Taipei. The first
T.D. Lee prizes of "The Universe" were given, in 2016, to Tong-Mow Yan
(Cornell) for his paper on "Drell-Yan Processes" and to Bruce McKellar
(Melbourne) for his paper on the HMW phase. An anonymous distinguished
committee was responsible for the choices. We should encourage the birth
of the brand new idea - in physics or in mathematics.

    Meanwhile, we tighten our criterion for the refereeing system -
an increase from two to three referees, picked by the core editors. All
these are applied to "The Universe" (having nothing to do the following
proposals). Basically, there are too many journals; we don't want to be
one of them.

    As of November 3, 2017, we would like to announce our intention for
the next step, the proposal to create a few "The Universe" series:

    The Universe A: Mathematics

    The Universe B: Physics

    The Universe C: Chemistry

    The Universe D: Refereed Conference Proceedings 

    We all know that Einstein's relativity principle and the quantum
principle, the two fundamendal physics principle, are here to dictate our
Universe or our World - so, in the 21st Century we should focus our
attention to understand the Universe. That is why we create "The Universe"
to begin with and propose the series for the purpose.

    Like Physical Review Series, there is an ampere room for the Universe
for the 21st Century - in fact, these days the name "physics" seems to be
too big and too wide. A precise name would lead to further progresses in
the said field(s).

    As the potential Editor-in-Chief for "The Universe A: Mathematics",
we suggest Y.T. Yau, the famous mathematician at Harvard,

    On the Editor-in-Chief for "The Universe B: Physics", we suggest the
director of T.D. Lee Center since we are giving out the T.D. Lee prizes
of "The Universe" once every three years.

    The beginning of each journal would be flexible, as the whole 21st
Century should give us a long-time span. The idea is that "The Universe A:
Mathematics" or "The Universe B: Physics" is a very good name (compared
with Physical Review, Modern physics, etc.), for the journal of the 21st
Century. As "century" intellectuals, we try to upgrade the level of the
basic knowledge, since Eistein's relativity principle and the quantum
principle should be here to dictate our World, the Universe.

                                Sincerely yours, W-Y. Pauchy Hwang
                                                  Editor-in-Chief
                                                  The Universe
