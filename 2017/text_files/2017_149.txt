Dear Yu-Nung,

thank you for sending out the inquiry letter for CASA feedback to everyone.
However, the deadline seems a bit tight.  May we change the deadline to
September 30 (Saturday)?  The CUC meeting will be held in early November
this year.

Cheers,
Yi-Jehng

Arizona Radio Observatory: Call for Proposals (Fall 2017)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Astronomers in Taiwan,

The Arizona Radio Observatory (ARO) solicits observing proposals for the ALMA
Prototype 12-meter Telescope (12m) located on Kitt Peak, Arizona, and for the
10-meter Submillimeter Telescope (SMT) located on Mount Graham, Arizona, for
the period October 15, 2017 - February 15, 2018. Proposal candidates from
members of the University Consortium of ALMA-Taiwan (UCAT) and ASIAA should
submit up to THREE pages of scientific and technical justification (including
figures, tables, and references) in addition to their Proposal Summary Sheet
(download form here):
  https://www.as.arizona.edu/sites/default/files/ARO_Proposal_Cover_Sheet.pdf

All proposal candidates are required to list on the Proposal Summary Sheet
their requested observing blocks (the exact LST ranges to be scheduled and
number of times to be repeated), dates on which they are not available to
observe, and dates in which sources in those observing blocks are within the
Sun-avoidance zone (45 degrees at the SMT, 10 degrees at the 12m).

The 12m ALMA Prototype antenna currently supports an ALMA Band 3 (84-116 GHz)
dual-polarization SBS (sideband-separating) receiver.  The 12m control system
supports dual-polarization in the same sideband or single-polarization in each
sideband ("2 IF mode"), position-switched, beam-switched, and OTF observations.
A new spectrometer, AROWS, is being commissioned on the 12m telescope and is
being made available on a best effort basis with 2 channels.  The AROWS center
IF frequency is fixed at 6.0 GHz for the full 4 GHz bandwidth mode, but is
steerable within the 4 GHz IF bandwidth in the higher resolution/smaller
bandwidth modes.  The older MAC autocorrelator and filter banks will still be
available as a backup.  Possible backend modes may be found on the ARO Equipment
Summary and Status sheet at:
  https://www.as.arizona.edu/arizona-radio-observatory

The 10m SMT currently supports a dual-polarization ALMA Band 6 (211-280 GHz)
receiver with SBS mixers.  A 0.4 mm (602-720 GHz) dual-polarization receiver
with ALMA Band 9 mixers will be available on a best effort basis for the period
of Dec-Feb; proposers for the 0.4 mm receiver are strongly encouraged to also
submit a 1 mm proposal (low frequency backup project) at the same LST range.
The Band 7 (320-370 GHz) receiver will not be available this semester. The SMT
control system supports both dual-polarization ("2 IF mode") and
dual-polarization+dual-sideband observations ("4 IF mode") with tunable IF from
4.5-7.5 GHz, for position-switched, beam-switched, and OTF observations.
Proposal candidates should consult the ARO Equipment Summary and Status sheet
for additional technical specifications:
  https://www.as.arizona.edu/arizona-radio-observatory

Remote observing is available. Observers who plan to observe remotely must
supply fixed IP address(es) of the computer(s) that will be used during
observing on their Proposal Summary Sheet. For further information about remote
observing and other operational questions, please contact Tom Folkers,
Operations Manager:  tfolkers@email.arizona.edu

Scheduling of successful proposals will be done according to availability of the
receivers requested.  Graduate student participation is especially encouraged.
The proposal deadline for this 2017 fall semester is set on September 15, 2017
(Friday).

Proposals should be emailed in PDF format to kuan[at]asiaa.sinica.edu.tw by
midnight (23:59 CST) September 15, 2017 (Friday).

*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Hung-Hsu Chan (NTU)
Topic:         How do stars affect wave-dark matter?
Time:         9/13 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
Wave dark matter (ψDM) consisting of a non-relativistic Bose-Einstein condensate, is considered to be a viable dark matter candidate. Due to the uncertainty principle that counters gravity below a Jeans scale, the small-scale structures are suppressed and a solitonic core persists in galaxy formation and evolution. We, for the first time, conduct ψDM simulations including stars. Nontrivial interactions between ψDM and stars are to be presented. ψDM lenses also show different strong lensing features from CDM lenses. The granularity in ψDM halos engenders anomalous fluxes of lensed images, and solitonic cores yield a distinct transition in the small-scale Einstein radius distribution.
