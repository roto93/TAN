To who it may concern,

Could you please forward the following announcement to TAN?

Dear all,

This is a reminder of "TTTT seminar" in NTHU.
We start to have periodic guest talks in the astro-ph class
in National Tsing Hua University (NTHU) namely
Timely Talk per Thirty days organized by Tetsuya (TTTT).
Any students and faculties are welcome to join.
The first speaker is as follows.

Title:
An extremely luminous dust-obscured galaxy discovered
by the optical to millimeter observations

Speaker: Yoshiki Toba
Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Academia Sinica

Time: 12:20pm 14th Dec. 2017 (Thursday)
Venue: R501, IoA, 5th floor in the 2nd General Building

Abstract:
I will report the discovery of an extremely-luminous dust-obscured
galaxy (DOG) at z = 3.70. This DOG is selected as a candidate of
extremely-luminous infrared (IR) galaxies based on the photometry
from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and Wide-field Infrared
Survey Explorer (WISE). In order to derive its accurate IR luminosity,
we perform follow-up observations at 450 and 850 micron using the
Submillimetre Common User Bolometer Array 2 (SCUBA-2) on the
James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT), and at 870 and 1300 micron
using the Submillimeter Array (SMA), which enable us to pin down its
IR Spectral Energy Distribution (SED). We perform SED fitting using
14 photometric data (0.4 - 1300 micron) and estimate its IR luminosity,
L_IR (8-1000 micron), to be {1.8 ± 0.2) × 10^14 L_sun, making it one
of the most luminous IR galaxies in the Universe. I will present our
follow-up observations and the SED modeling in detail
(Toba et al. 2017, ApJ, submitted).

With best regards,
Tetsuya

*** Special Seminar ***
____________________________________________________
Speaker:        Nadia M. Murillo (Leiden Observatory)
Topic:          Forming stellar siblings: a look at the chemistry and physics of multiple stars
Time:           11/27 (Monday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Multiple stars are commonly found throughout our galaxy at all mass ranges. They are excellent stellar physics laboratories and the cause of many interesting phenomena such as certain types of supernovae, planetary nebulae and binary black holes.
Observations find multiplicity at all stages of stellar evolution. An elevated frequency of multiplicity is found at the early stages of star formation, which shows that most stars are formed in multiple systems. In this talk we look at some of the open questions regarding formation and structure of multiple stars, namely the formation of rotationally supported disks, chemical structure of early stage star formation, and the factors that influence star formation. Multi-wavelength observations are coupled with chemical and physical models, to address these questions. We demonstrate that stellar multiplicity is common and needs to be taken into account in our picture of star formation.
