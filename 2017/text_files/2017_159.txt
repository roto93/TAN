Abstract

Complex organic compounds of mixed aromatic/aliphatic structures are now known to be widespread in the Universe, ranging from objects in our solar system to distant galaxies.  Spectral signatures of complex organics can be found as early as 10 billion years ago, but the origin of these organics is not known.  Through the techniques of millimeter-wave spectroscopy, over 170 molecules have been identified through their rotational transitions.  The list contains organic molecules of every kind, including hydrocarbons, alcohols, acids, aldehydes, amines, ethers, etc.  Space infrared spectroscopy has detected the stretching and bending modes of compounds with aromatic and aliphatic structures and showed that complex organic compounds can be synthesized in evolved stars over periods as short as several hundred years.  Analyses of samples of meteorites, comets, asteroids, and interplanetary dust also reveals a rich content of organic substances, some of which could be of extra-sola!
r origin.  How complex organics can be synthesized under very low density conditions over very short time scales represent a major challenge in astrochemistry.

We review the current state of understanding of the origin, evolution, nature, and distribution of organic matter in space.  The possibility of existence of primordial organics on Earth and the implications of extraterrestrial organics on the origin of life on Earth will be discussed.  Also discussed are a number of unexplained astronomical phenomena whose origins could be traced to organic carriers.
