Arizona Radio Observatory: Call for Proposals (Fall 2017)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Astronomers in Taiwan,

The Arizona Radio Observatory (ARO) solicits observing proposals for the ALMA
Prototype 12-meter Telescope (12m) located on Kitt Peak, Arizona, and for the
10-meter Submillimeter Telescope (SMT) located on Mount Graham, Arizona, for
the period October 15, 2017 - February 15, 2018. Proposal candidates from
members of the University Consortium of ALMA-Taiwan (UCAT) and ASIAA should
submit up to THREE pages of scientific and technical justification (including
figures, tables, and references) in addition to their Proposal Summary Sheet
(download form here):
  https://www.as.arizona.edu/sites/default/files/ARO_Proposal_Cover_Sheet.pdf

All proposal candidates are required to list on the Proposal Summary Sheet
their requested observing blocks (the exact LST ranges to be scheduled and
number of times to be repeated), dates on which they are not available to
observe, and dates in which sources in those observing blocks are within the
Sun-avoidance zone (45 degrees at the SMT, 10 degrees at the 12m).

The 12m ALMA Prototype antenna currently supports an ALMA Band 3 (84-116 GHz)
dual-polarization SBS (sideband-separating) receiver.  The 12m control system
supports dual-polarization in the same sideband or single-polarization in each
sideband ("2 IF mode"), position-switched, beam-switched, and OTF observations.
A new spectrometer, AROWS, is being commissioned on the 12m telescope and is
being made available on a best effort basis with 2 channels.  The AROWS center
IF frequency is fixed at 6.0 GHz for the full 4 GHz bandwidth mode, but is
steerable within the 4 GHz IF bandwidth in the higher resolution/smaller
bandwidth modes.  The older MAC autocorrelator and filter banks will still be
available as a backup.  Possible backend modes may be found on the ARO Equipment
Summary and Status sheet at:
  https://www.as.arizona.edu/arizona-radio-observatory

The 10m SMT currently supports a dual-polarization ALMA Band 6 (211-280 GHz)
receiver with SBS mixers.  A 0.4 mm (602-720 GHz) dual-polarization receiver
with ALMA Band 9 mixers will be available on a best effort basis for the period
of Dec-Feb; proposers for the 0.4 mm receiver are strongly encouraged to also
submit a 1 mm proposal (low frequency backup project) at the same LST range.
The Band 7 (320-370 GHz) receiver will not be available this semester. The SMT
control system supports both dual-polarization ("2 IF mode") and
dual-polarization+dual-sideband observations ("4 IF mode") with tunable IF from
4.5-7.5 GHz, for position-switched, beam-switched, and OTF observations.
Proposal candidates should consult the ARO Equipment Summary and Status sheet
for additional technical specifications:
  https://www.as.arizona.edu/arizona-radio-observatory

Remote observing is available. Observers who plan to observe remotely must
supply fixed IP address(es) of the computer(s) that will be used during
observing on their Proposal Summary Sheet. For further information about remote
observing and other operational questions, please contact Tom Folkers,
Operations Manager:  tfolkers@email.arizona.edu 

Scheduling of successful proposals will be done according to availability of the
receivers requested.  Graduate student participation is especially encouraged.
The proposal deadline for this 2017 fall semester is set on September 15, 2017
(Friday).

Proposals should be emailed in PDF format to kuan[at]asiaa.sinica.edu.tw by
midnight (23:59 CST) September 15, 2017 (Friday).

Speaker:    Ya-Wen Tang (ASIAA)
Topic:         Internal share archive of ALMA data
Time:         8/21 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
Beside the regular PI projects of ALMA, one can also utilize the public ALMA data for his/her own research.
In this talk, I will present the motivation why we need an interval share data archive and the plan.



*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Mike Barlow (UCL)
Topic:         Observations of Supernova Dust and Molecules
Time:         8/23 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
Although a number of models for the formation of dust in the ejecta of 
core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) had predicted that between 0.1 and 1.0 
Msun of dust could be formed per event, it was not until the 2009-2013 
Herschel mission that direct observational evidence was obtained for the 
presence of such large masses of dust in several young supernova remnants, 
including Cas A, the Crab Nebula and SN 1987A. High angular resolution 
submillimetre observations of SN 1987A with ALMA subsequently confirmed 
that its cold dust emission originated from the inner expanding ejecta. 
The presence of dust in CCSN ejecta can also be diagnosed and quantified  from red-blue asymmetries in their late-time optical emission line profiles. I will summarise current results for SN dust masses based on these methods. >
The ALMA observations of the ejecta of SN 1987A also revealed strong CO and SiO rotational line emission. Broad CO line emission has also been detected from the reverse shock region of Cas A, while ArH+ (argonium) rotational lines were first detected by Herschel from the Crab Nebula. These molecular lines have opened up the possibility of measuring supernova isotope ratios for the first time.



*** Special Seminar ***
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Roger Wesson (UCL)
Topic:         The abundance discrepancy problem in planetary nebulae
Time:         8/24 (Thursday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
The abundances of heavy elements in planetary nebulae reveal the evolutionary past of the central star, and the future of the interstellar medium, but suffer from a major systematic uncertainty: abundances derived from emission lines formed by recombination exceed those from collisionally excited lines by a factor ranging from ~2 to nearly three orders of magnitude in the most extreme case. The discrepancy has been known since the 1940s but only now are its causes being tracked down. There is now substantial evidence for the presence of cold hydrogen-deficient material within the normal hydrogen-rich gas of planetary nebulae, which gives rise to strongly enhanced recombination line emission. > 
It has recently become clear that the most extreme abundance discrepancies occur in nebulae which have a close binary central star. I will discuss my recent work which has doubled the sample of nebulae with a close binary central star and known chemistry, placing new constraints on the origin of hydrogen deficient material and the cause of the abundance discrepancy.
