Dear ICSM group members, interested IAA researchers and visitors,

On behalf of Dr. Ciska Kemper, I would like to let you know that we are
organising the 5th Annual IAA Interstellar and Circumstellar Medium
Workshop, focussing on circumstellar and interstellar dust and gas in the
Milky Way and other galaxies. The workshop will be held on *Friday, the
28th of July*.

The goal of this workshop is to foster collaboration within the institute
on topics related to the physics and chemistry of the interstellar and
circumstellar medium, ranging from the Solar System and planet-forming
environments to the ISM in external galaxies.
It also provides the ICSM group and others working on similar topics to
showcase their work within IAA. The meeting is held during the summer to
enable the summer students to attend, and the talks are planned at a level
understandable to the students.

At this time I would like to call for oral presentations (about 15-20 min)
at this meeting. Please send me an email with a proposed title and a brief
description (if the title isn't descriptive enough already) *by Friday, the
7th of July*.

For inspiration, have a look at the program of our previous meetings:
http://events.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/workshop/20160809/program.php
http://events.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/workshop/20150807/program.php
http://events.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/workshop/20140711/program.php
http://events.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/workshop/20130716/program.php

but anything that falls under the title of the workshop should be fine.

If you are interested in attending the weekly ICSM meetings also, please
consider signing up for the ICSM mailing list:

Looking forward to your responses,
