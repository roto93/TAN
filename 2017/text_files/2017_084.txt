Dear Colleagues,

This is a reminder of the 3rd KAGRA International Workshop (KIW3) 

Place: ASIAA (NTU campus) 
Dates: May/21,22:

http://grqc.ncts.ncku.edu.tw/KAGRA2017/index.html

The LIGO discovery of Gravitational Wave (GW) opened a new era of GW physics and astronomy.
It is a good opportunity for Taiwan to join such a new wave !!

All the PI and/or exPI of the projects:

* The former LIGO PI, G. Gonzalez
* The new Virgo PI, J. Van den Brand 
* The KAGRA PI and 2015 Nobel laureate, T. Kajita

will present in the workshop on May/22.

The deadline of the registration is now extended for another week.
If you are interested, please do not forget to mark your calendar and make a registration:

Dear Colleagues,

This is a reminder of the 2rd ASTROD International Workshop (AIW2)

Place: Rm 620, Physics Building, Tsing Hua Univ., Hsinchu
Dates: May/23:

lhttp://www.phys.nthu.edu.tw/~gravity/gws2017/index.php
<http://grqc.ncts.ncku.edu.tw/KAGRA2017/index.html>

LISA Pathfinder reached the drag-free requirement of LISA and paved the road
for space gravitational wave GW detection. Space GW measurement may have
the largest S/N ratio over all GW bands.

All the PI/spokesmem of the projects:

* M. Ando, DECIGO and B-DECIGO
* M. Hewitson, LISA Pathfinder and new LISA
* H.-C. Yeh, TIANQIN

will present in the workshop on May/23 for deliberations.

*The deadline of the registration is May 10*.
If you are interested, please do not forget to mark your calendar and make
a registration:

Speaker:    Kuan-Chou Hou (ASIAA)
Topic:         Dust enrichment in galaxy and cosmology simulations
Time:         5/15 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:         R1203


*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Martin Bureau (University of Oxford)
Topic:         3D Observations of Molecular Gas in Galaxies: From Global Dynamics to Supermassive Black Holes
Time:         5/17 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
I will first briefly review the molecular gas content of early-type
galaxies. I will show not only that they unexpectedly harbour much
cold gas, but also that it is the best tracer of the circular
velocity, thus allowing accurate spatially-resolved dynamical mass
measurements in galaxies across the Hubble sequence. Second, I will
explore the use of molecular gas for studies of the Tully-Fisher
(luminosity-rotational velocity) relation of galaxies to high
redshifts. I will highlight the work done to establish local (z=0)
benchmarks and will discuss the challenges posed by systematic effects
when comparing nearby and distant galaxies. Third, I will demonstrate
that CO can be used to easily and accurately measure the mass of the
supermassive black holes lurking at galaxy centres. I will discuss
substantial ongoing efforts to do this and present many spectacular
new ALMA measurements, that open the way to literaly hundreds of
measurements across the Hubble sequence with a unique method. I will
also hint at how the same data allow to study the spatially-resolved
properties of giant molecular cloud populations in non-local galaxies
for the first time, providing a new tool to understand and contrast
the star formation efficiency of galaxies on cloud scale.


*** Special Seminar ***
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Karl Ziemelis (Nature)
Topic:         Inside Nature
Time:         5/17 (Wednesday) 11:00 - 12:00
Place:         R1107
Abstract:
Since its launch in 1869, Nature has seen its mission as two-fold: facilitating the prompt communication of the most important scientific developments to the relevant research communities, while at the same time fostering a greater appreciation of these great works of science amongst the wider public. Although the publishing landscape for scientific research is currently undergoing a period of unprecedented change, these core principles remain largely unchanged. In this talk, I will endeavour to shed light on how Nature editors apply these principles in practice, and so determine which few of the many excellent research submissions that we receive make it through to publication.
