*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Yusei Koyama (Subaru Telescope)
Topic:         Tracking down the evolution of cluster galaxies across cosmic time with Subaru panoramic H-alpha imaging survey
Time:         10/25 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
We present our systematic, wide-field, narrow-band H-alpha imaging campaign of distant (proto-)clusters at 0.4 < z < 2.5 with Suprime-Cam, MOIRCS, and Hyper Suprime-Cam on the Subaru Telescope. Using the large H-alpha galaxies selected from a variety of environment across cosmic time, we discuss the environmental dependence/independence of various galaxy properties such as color, mass, and (specific) SFR of star-forming cluster galaxies. We also talk about our recent efforts to study environmental impacts on dust and/or molecular gas properties in galaxies using AKARI and Nobeyama 45m radio telescope. Finally, we also introduce our “ULTIMATE-Subaru” project - the next-generation, wide-field ground-layer adaptive optics (GLAO) development project of Subaru - which will become a major facility instrument of Subaru in mid-2020s after HSC and PFS.
