First announcement 

Magnetic fields along the star-formation sequence: bridging polarization-sensitive views

Focus Meeting 4 at the IAU General Assembly 
Vienna (Austria) 
August 30-31, 2018 

https://escience.aip.de/iau30-fm4/



Dear colleagues,

We invite you to join us at the 2018 IAU General Assembly for a Focus Meeting dedicated to the role of magnetic fields in the star-formation process.

In this Focus Meeting we wish to gather the different communities working with magnetized models and polarimetric observations of the various stages and objects along the star formation sequence, from molecular clouds to young stars reaching the main sequence. 

The goal is to discuss how to compare constraints on magnetic fields at different evolutionary stages and physical scales in order to establish a coherent view of their role in the multi-scale process of star formation. Combining observational results and theoretical expectations from different communities is complex, so we especially welcome contributions that will emphasize how different measurements of magnetic fields can be compared and interpreted in a coherent way, despite the widely varying observing techniques, objects, and physical scales that are involved in studies across the star-formation sequence.

Note that registration for IAU GA 2018 and payment of the corresponding fees will be handled by the IAU General Assembly organizers and are mandatory to participate in the event!  See submission details below.

We look forward to seeing you in Vienna in August, 2018!

On behalf of the SOC, 
Anaelle Maury, Swetlana Hubrig, and Chat Hull (co-chairs), Silvia Alencar, Andrea Bracco, Edith Falgarone, Josep Miquel Girart, Martin Houde, Jungmi Kwon, Hiro Takami, Helmut Wiesemeyer, Qizhou Zhang.
