East-Asia ALMA Science Workshop 2017 - Korea

This is the final reminder of the East Asia ALMA Science Workshop 2017 - Korea. The deadline for registration is tomorrow (Oct. 31). If you are interested in participating the workshop, please don¡¦t miss the deadline. Also, you still have a chance to present a poster.
