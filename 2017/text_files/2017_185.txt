[Subaru Planetary Nebula workshop; Dec 11-13 in Hong Kong]

Dear all, 

We have a meeting aiming to promote planetary nebula
and related science cases using the Subaru Telescope amongst researchers 
in potential partner countries (Taiwan, China, Korea, Australia). 
This meeting is officially supported by NAOJ.

The meeting (Dec 11-13) is hold at the university of Hong Kong immediately 
after asymmetric planetary nebulae IV meeting in Hong Kong.
The tentative program as of 10 Nov is as follows.

---

11 Dec morning (Day 1)
* Introduction of this workshop: M. Otsuka (ASIAA)
* Introduction of Subaru Telescope: A. Tajitsu (NAOJ/Subaru)
* Overview of planetary nebulae: S. Kwok (HKU)

11 Dec afternoon
* Chemical abundances of planetary nebulae and related objects
- Stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis: A. Karakas (Monash University)
- Elemental abundances of MW PNe: T.-H. Lee (W. Kentucky Univ./ASIAA)
- Elemental abundances of PNe in M31: X. Fang (HKU)

* Chemical evolution of galaxies
- K. Bekki (University of Western Australia)
- T. Tsujimoto (NAOJ)

12 Dec morning (Day 2)
* Dust and molecules in planetary nebulae
- Overview: J. Cami (University of Western Ontario)
- Characteristics of PAHs in PNe: R. Ohsawa (U. of Tokyo)
- Far-IR dust component in PNe by Herschel: K. Asano (U. of Denver)
- Dusty disks around white dwarfs: Y.-H. Chu (ASIAA)

12 Dec afternoon
* Database of planetary nebulae
- Q. A. Parker (HKU)

* Study of PNe and related objects done/doing by using Subaru Telescope
- T. Ueta (U. Denver), A. Tajitsu (NAOJ/Subaru), M. Otsuka (ASIAA)

* Discussion 
- potential research initiatives/collaborations
  using Subaru Telescope

13 Dec morning (Day 3)
* writing observing proposals for S18B

13 Dec afternoon
* writing observing proposals for S18B (cont.)
* future plans and summary

---

We would like to spend a good chunk of time developing actual proposals 
using the current instruments and future delivered instruments such as PSF, 
and discussing international operation.

Topic:         Testing Isotropic Universe via Properties of Gamma-Ray Bursts Detected by Fermi / GBM
Time:         11/13 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
The sky distribution of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) has been intensively studied for more than two decades. Most of these studies, test the isotropy of GRBs based on the sky number density distribution. We propose a new method which inspects the isotropy of the properties of GRBs such as their duration, fluences and peak fluxes at various energy bands and different time scales. The method was applied on the Fermi / Gamma-ray Burst Monitor data. We found a relatively significant feature near the Galactic coordinates approximately l = 30 deg, b = 15 deg and radius r = 20 - 40 deg with the inferred probability for the occurrence of such signal (in a random isotropic sample) to be less than a percent. However, more comprehensive analysis using different statistical tests and different samples show that the detected feature can be due to statistical fluctuations. Investigations on the updated Fermi / GBM sample as well as on the data sets of other instruments can clarify on the issue.



*** Special Seminar ***

Speaker:    Chia-Yu Hu (Center for Computational Astrophysics)
Topic:         Resolving supernova-driven outflows in full-disk simulations
Time:         11/14 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
Current large-scale cosmological simulations began to reproduce realistic galaxy populations, where strong galactic outflows driven by supernovae have been identified as one of the key ingredients to this success. However, the origin of galactic outflows remains poorly understood, and the phenomenological recipes of outflows adopted in cosmological simulations render their predictive power somewhat ambiguous. In this talk, I will argue that the way to move forward is to utilize high-resolution simulations of galaxies in an idealized setup where supernova feedback and the multi-phase interstellar medium can be properly resolved. I will show that converged outflow properties can be obtained at the resolution of ~ 5 solar masses. Outflows are driven by the hot and over-pressurized gas which breaks the disk during the formation of superbubbles. Injecting the terminal momentum of individual supernova blastwaves, a common remedy adopted in the literature to compensate unresolved s!
upernova events, fails to drive outflows due to its incapability to thermalize the gas.



*** Colloquium ***

Speaker:    Iain Mcdonald (University of Manchester)
Topic:         The fate of stars: stellar death and new life
Time:         11/15 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
We are stardust, made from the insides of stars. To understand where we come from, we need to understand how material made in the cores of stars is released into the interstellar medium. A key factor in this is the timing of stellar mass loss. In this talk, I will argue that the mass-loss formulisms we currently use for low-mass stars are not fit for purpose, and that a new one needs to be constructed. I'll discuss the work we are doing to calibrate the mass-loss prescription for evolved stars, particularly in the early Universe, where the mechanisms of stellar mass are not well calibrated.
