Speaker:    Keiichi Umetsu (ASIAA)
Topic:         Formation and Evolution of Cosmic Giants: Lensing View of Galaxy Cluster Halos
Time:         10/30 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
I will talk about the discovery of a "plane" dictating dark-matter halo evolution from our gravitational lensing and X-ray observations. We show that high-mass galaxy clusters—cosmic giants formed in the universe—lie on a plane in the 3D logarithmic space of their characteristic halo radius "rs", mass "Ms" , and X-ray temperature "Tx" with a very small orthogonal scatter. The tight correlation indicates that the gas temperature was determined at a specific cluster formation time, which is encoded in (rs,Ms) and that the gas was heated when the clusters were in the fast-growing phase. Intriguingly, the plane is significantly tilted with respect to the canonical virial expectation, Tx ∝ Ms /rs.  We show that the self-similar solution of Bertschinger (1985) for secondary infall and accretion can explain the observed relation, Tx ∝ Ms^1.5 /rs^2. Numerical simulations reproduce the observed plane and its angle. This result holds independently of the gas physics implemente!
d in the code, revealing the fundamental origin of this plane.



*** Colloquium ***

Speaker:    Meng-Ru Wu (ASIOP)
Topic:         The Gold mine of the universe: the r-process nucleosynthesis in explosive astrophysical events
Time:         11/1 (Wednesday) 15:40 - 16:40
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
The astrophysical site hosting the formation of elements heavier than iron, including Silver and Gold via the rapid neutron-capture process (r-process) has been debated for many decades. Over the past few years, owing to the advances of theoretical development and various observational hints, the prevalent paradigm shifted largely from core-collapse supernovae to the merger of compact objects -- binary neutron stars or one neutron star with one black hole. In this talk, I will first introduce the basic concept and ingredients of the r-process nucleosynthesis. I will then discuss some of the recent evidences and discoveries which are relevant for identifying the r-process sites, including the most recent detection of the merger of the binary neutron stars. I will also speak about the theoretical uncertainties and challenges lying ahead.



*** Colloquium ***

Speaker:    Po-Chieh Yu (NCU)
Topic:         The Story of GW170817/EM170817
Time:         11/1 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
On August 17, 2017 at 12∶41:04 UTC, the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo gravitational-wave detectors made their fifth observation of gravitational wave (GW), GW170817. For the first time, astronomers confirmed the electromagnetic (EM) counterpart of GW170817 in the nearby galaxy NGC 4993, is due to a binary neutron star merger. Since neutron stars merger is the candidate site for nuclear synthesis of heavy elements such as gold, the work of global network can help in understanding the origin of the these heavy elements – one of the mystery in modern astrophysics.  In this talk, I will review current results from GW170817/EM170817. Particularly, I will introduce the contribution of IANCU in this breakthrough discovery. Also, I will show the current status of Lulin observatory from follow-up observations of GW and transient sources. Finally, I will introduce several projects of IANCU and discuss what role Taiwan can play in the era of multi-messenger  astronomy.
