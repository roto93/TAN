Title: ALMA Observations of Spiral Accretion Flows
        Towards Extremely Young Protostars

Abstract:

Studying the accretion flows toward extremely young
protostars is an important step for understanding
how the protostars and the protoplanetary disks are
assembled in the early stage of star formation.
The accretion flows are commonly seen in the MHD
numerical simulations; however, it is rarely observed
toward young protostars.

Here we present our ALMA observations of the accretion
flows around the extremely young protostar VLA1623A with
a Keplerian disk likely just formed (Murillo, Lai,
et al. 2013). "Dendrogram" algorithm (Goodman et al.
2009) are used to identify the accretion flows, and
we find the three brightest "branches" and their
associated "leaves" likely correspond to the spiral
structure flowing toward the central young cluster.

We further compare the three accretion flows in the
position-position-velocity cube to the CMU model
(Ulrich 1976; Cassen & Moosman 1981) which describe
the velocity structure of the gas accreting to the
central protostar with constant angular momentum.
We find that our identified branch structures well
match with the CMU model.
