Dear all the GLT related members,

Here we report you that we finally got the astronomical first
light with GLT using the 86 GHz receiver!!!

..

We are pretty happy that we got the first light within 2017,
as we proposed before.  It was the Christmas day here, so we
got a pretty nice Christmas gift :)  Thank you very much for
your helps for a long time, and let's go for the EHT observation!

..


Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!!!
Kevin and Satoki @ Thule
