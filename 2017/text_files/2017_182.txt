Abstract:
The well-established scaling relationships for supermassive black holes can be preserved  across cosmic time if star formation in these galaxies  is regulated by feedback via mechanical and radiative power from the accreting central supermassive black hole. We have undertaken a multi-wavelength investigation  of about 130 southern AGN at redshifts<0.02, in order to search for signatures of AGN feedback. We have obtained optical integrated field unit datacubes for our sample with the Siding Spring 2.3m telescope, and are doing follow-up  radio imaging with the GMRT and ATCA in addition to the compilation of data at multiple frequencies. Our work in progress on this multi-wavelength investigation will be discussed.

November 3, 2017

Dear our colleagues, key members of APCosPA Org:

    "The Universe" have been there for almost five years - as a 
journal/newsletter for the 21st Century. We have always in mind that the 
journal was created for the new century, the 21st Century. Enclosed please 
find the current list from the Inspire, the largest particle physics 
information system.

    We have created, for the authors of the papers in "The Universe", the
T.D. Lee Prize(s) of "The Universe", giving out once every three years. 
The prize carries US3,600$ plus round-trip travel to Taipei. The first 
T.D. Lee prizes of "The Universe" were given, in 2016, to Tong-Mow Yan 
(Cornell) for his paper on "Drell-Yan Processes" and to Bruce McKellar 
(Melbourne) for his paper on the HMW phase. An anonymous distinguished 
committee was responsible for the choices. We should encourage the birth 
of the brand new idea - in physics or in mathematics.      

    Meanwhile, we tighten our criterion for the refereeing system - 
an increase from two to three referees, picked by the core editors. All 
these are applied to "The Universe" (having nothing to do the following 
proposals). Basically, there are too many journals; we don't want to be 
one of them. 

    As of November 3, 2017, we would like to announce our intention for 
the next step, the proposal to create a few "The Universe" series:

    The Universe A: Mathematics

    The Universe B: Physics

    The Universe C (Refereed Conference Proceedings)

    We all know that Einstein's relativity principle and the quantum 
principle, the two fundamendal physics principle, are here to dictate our 
Universe or our World - so, in the 21st Century we should focus our 
attention to understand the Universe. That is why we create "The Universe" 
to begin with and propose the series for the purpose. 

    Like Physical Review Series, there is an ampere room for the Universe 
for the 21st Century - in fact, these days the name "physics" seems to be 
too big and too wide. A precise name would lead to further progresses in 
the said field(s). 

    As the potential Editor-in-Chief for "The Universe A: Mathematics", 
we suggest Y.T. Yau, the famous mathematician at Harvard,

    On the Editor-in-Chief for "The Universe B: Physics", we suggest the 
director of T.D. Lee Center since we are giving out the T.D. Lee prizes 
of "The Universe" once every three years.

    The beginning of each journal would be flexible, as the whole 21st 
Century should give us a long-time span. The idea is that "The Universe A: 
Mathematics" or "The Universe B: Physics" is a very good name (compared 
with Physical Review, Modern physics, etc.), for the journal of the 21st 
Century. As "century" intellectuals, we try to upgrade the level of the 
basic knowledge, since Eistein's relativity principle and the quantum 
principle should be here to dictate our World, the Universe.  

                                Sincerely yours, W-Y. Pauchy Hwang
                                                  Editor-in-Chief
                                                  The Universe
