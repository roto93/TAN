Dear all,

We will have a special TTTT seminar on 26 Dec. in NTHU, given by Dr. 
Seong Jin Kim,
who is  a new postdoc in Prof. Tomo's group in NTHU.

Title:
Properties of 250 um-selected dusty star-forming (SF) galaxies in the 
North Ecliptic Pole (NEP) field

Speaker: Dr. Seong Jin Kim

Time: 12:20pm 26th Dec. 2017 (Tuesday)

Venue: R501, IoA, 5th floor in the 2nd General Building in NTHU

Abstract:
To introduce my current work, I would like to give a presentation about 
the star-forming (SF) galaxies
selected by 250 um band detection of the Herschel/SPIRE survey on the 
entire North Ecliptic Pole (NEP)
field of AKARI.  By matching these SPIRE sources with the optical 
spectroscopic survey data, around 300
SF galaxies were selected. We carried out spectral energy distribution 
(SED) fit using multi-wavelength
photometric data for the sample. The physical properties derived in this 
work will be presented and discussed.

With best regards,
Tetsuya
