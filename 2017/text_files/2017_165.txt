Topic:         Studying Cosmology with Galaxy Clusters
Time:         10/11 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
Galaxy clusters contain rich information of cosmology and astrophysics. In the past, cluster science was limited by a lack of adequately deep observations in multi-wavelength and was subject to heterogeneous samples with small sizes at low redshift. The situation has been changed due to the recent success of the large mm wavelength surveys—such as the South Pole Telescope (SPT)—that employ the Sunyaev-Zel’dovich Effect (SZE) to identify and study galaxy clusters in their abundance out to the early and distant Universe. Together with the breakthroughs in the area of wide-and-deep optical and NIR surveys, such as the Dark Energy Survey and the Hyper Suprime-Cam survey, we are able to uniformly study these SZE selected samples. In this talk, I will talk about the recent results from the SPT collaboration with emphasis on various observable to mass scaling relations. I will present the unprecedented study of the baryon content of an approximately mass-limited sample of 91 !
galaxy clusters out to redshift 1.3. I will demonstrate the crucial need for the accurate mass calibration in order to pave a way for cluster science in the future.

Topic:         Understanding Type Ia Supernova with UV Spectroscopy
Time:         10/12 (Thursday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
Type Ia Supernovae are exceptionally bright explosions, and their calibrateable brightness makes them critical tools for probing the cosmic expansion. However, their progenitors remain unclear, which could introduce uncertainties in their use in cosmology. Theory suggests that SN Ia progenitor metallicity is correlated with its peak luminosity, but not its light-curve shape. As a result, this effect should lead to an increased Hubble scatter, reducing the precision in distance measurement. Models also indicate that changing the progenitor metallicity will have little effect on the appearance of optical SN data, but significantly change UV spectra. We obtained the sample of SN Ia with UV spectral time series from both Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and Swift satellite. The initial results are presented by comparing the SN and UV spectral features and analyse the dependence of SN properties on metallicity.
