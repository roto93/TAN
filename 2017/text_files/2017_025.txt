Title: There Is Life after Stellar Middle Age

Abstract:
The discovery of how stars function and evolve counts among the twentieth
century's greatest scientific achievements. In the twenty-first century
the problems that still challenge us are intrinsically multidimensional
and multiscale: star formation, supernovae, stellar convection and mass
loss, and common envelope evolution, among others. Given the extreme
conditions and large spatial and temporal ranges of stellar evolution, our
theoretical understanding of this subject rests heavily on numerical
simulations containing a mixture of modeling and first-principles
calculation. I will discuss the application of these techniques to the
evolution of common envelope systems and explain the potential
significance of advances in this area for a wide range of astrophysical
problems.

Tea/Discussion Time is followed !  All Welcome !!
