*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Ing-Guey Jiang (NTHU)
Topic:         Is there any Earth-like exoplanet at 1 AU from a G-type Star ?
Time:         8/16 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
It has been a great success that with continuous effort of ground-based and space projects, thousands of exoplanets were found. In addition to introducing recent results and progress of my group's on-going planetary projects, the existence of Earth-like exoplanets at 1 AU from a G-type star will be addressed through planetary mass-period functions.  The implications of this existence will be discussed.


*** TIARA Seminar ***
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Alexandre Lazarian (University of Wisconsin, Madison)
Topic:         New Ways of Studying Magnetic Fields: Implications of MHD Turbulence Theory
Time:         8/16 (Wednesday) 13:00 - 14:00
Place:         R1107
Abstract:
I shall introduce three new techniques of magnetic field tracing. The first two use Doppler-shifted emission lines and employs the gradients of velocity in order to trace magnetic fields in the diffuse interstellar media as well as to trace regions of star formation associated with the gravitational collapse. The differences between these techniques is that they use different observationally available measures, i.e. the first one uses the velocity centroids and the other uses velocity channel maps.
I shall provide the theoretical foundations of the techniques that are based on our modern understanding of MHD turbulence, the numerical testing of the techniques as well as the comparison of the directions obtained with the velocity gradients using GALFA HI data and those of magnetic field as traced by Planck as well as 13CO data and far infrared polarimetry with BLASTPOL. I shall also discuss the third technique which employs the synchrotron intensity gradients that also trace magnetic field and, unlike synchrotron polarization, are insensitive to Faraday rotation. I shall also show its correspondence with the magnetic field tracing by Planck synchrotron polarimetry and discuss the synergy of using this technique with synchrotron polarization studies.
