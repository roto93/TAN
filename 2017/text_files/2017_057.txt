Workshop rationale:
It is our pleasure to announce that we are organizing a workshop entitled 
"East-Asia AGN Workshop 2017" held on 4th-6th December 2017 in 
Kagoshima, Japan. This is the fifth meeting of a series of workshops for 
East Asian collaborations in the AGN/SMBH field. The East-Asia AGN 
Workshop aims at fostering close collaborations among AGN/SMBH 
researchers in East Asian countries. Research collaborations in East Asia 
are getting more important recently, given various opportunities provided 
by East Asian Observatory (JCMT, Subaru, ...) and also on-going and 
future large international projects such as ALMA, TMT, and GMT. We 
believe that this workshop will provide various opportunity to foster new 
collaborations for tackling exciting mysteries in the AGN/SMBH field.

Important dates:
Early April 2017: 1st circular
Middle June: 2nd circular & registration open
Middle September: deadline for registration & abstract submission
