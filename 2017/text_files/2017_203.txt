Dear all,

    The ALMA Cycle 6 Pre-announcement has been released. 

    The Joint ALMA Observatory (JAO) will start the next cycle of observing (Cycle 6) in October 2018. 
    A Call for Proposals with detailed information on Cycle 6 will be issued in March 2018, with a deadline for proposal submission in April 2018. 
    This pre-announcement highlights aspects of the Cycle 6 proposal call that are needed to plan proposals.

    The key dates for Cycle 6 are given below.

        18 December 2017    Cycle 6 pre-announcement

        1 February 2018    Additional information on configuration schedule

        20 March 2018        Release of the ALMA Cycle 6 Call for Proposals and Observing Tool, and opening of archive for proposal submission

        19 April 2018        Proposal deadline

        18-23 June 2018    Proposal Review meeting

        End of July 2018    Result of the proposal review sent to Proposers

        6 September 2018    Deadline for Phase 2 submission by Proposers

        October 2018        Start of ALMA Cycle 6 observations

        September 2019    End of Cycle 6 observations

    New in Cycle 6 â€” In Cycle 6, the following opportunities will be available to Proposers for the first time.

        a. Circular polarization: proposals will be accepted for Bands 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 in all (including circular) polarization modes for continuum and spectral-line observations. The minimum detectable degree of circular polarization, defined as three times the systematic calibration uncertainty, is currently 1.8% of the peak flux for both TDM and FDM observations. Additional information on the circular polarization capabilities will be presented in the 1 February 2018 announcement on the ALMA Science Portal.

        b. Band 6 IF extension: The Band 6 IF bandwidth has been increased by 0.5 GHz to extend from 4.5 to 10 GHz. This will enable 12CO, 13CO, and C18O J=2-1 to be observed simultaneously with broader spectral windows for galactic sources and nearby galaxies.

        c. Band 8 ACA Standalone: Band 8 can be requested on the ACA in standalone mode.

        d. Band 8 standard mode: Band 8 will become a standard mode starting in Cycle 6.
