Dear Yi-Jehng,

I would appreciate it if you could circulate the SMA call for proposals=20=

(2017B semester) to TAN.

Regards,
Naomi

--------------------------------------------

Dear Colleague,

We wish to draw your attention to the currrently open call for proposals =
for observations with the Submillimeter Array (SMA), the reconfigurable =
interferometric array of eight 6-m antennas on Mauna Kea jointly built =
and operated by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory and the =
Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics. The array =
operates in the 230 GHz, 345 GHz and 400 GHz bands.=20

The SMA is currently accepting proposals for the 2017B observing =
semester (16 Nov, 2017 - 15 May, 2018) from principal investigators from =
the worldwide astronomical community. The proposal deadline is Wed., 6 =
Sep. 2017, 16:00 EDT (US) [Wed., 6 Sep. 2017, 10:00 HST (Hawaii)/ Wed., =
6 Sep. 2017, 20:00 GMT / Thu., 7 Sep. 2017, 04:00 CST (Taipei)]

The SMA has recently completed significant upgrades in observational =
capability, with more underway. Currently, the SMA observes =
simultaneously with two orthogonally polarized receivers, one in the 230 =
GHz or 345 GHz band and the other in the 240 GHz or 400 GHz band (with =
full polarimetric observations available using the 230+240 or 345+400  =
band combinations). The SWARM correlator processes 8 GHz bandwidth for =
each receiver in each sideband, for a total of 32 GHz, at a uniform 140 =
kHz resolution. This 32 GHz frequency coverage can be continuous where =
the tuning ranges overlap for the two orthogonally polarized receivers. =
In short, the SMA now provides flexible, wide band frequency coverage =
that delivers high continuum sensitivity and excellent spectral line =
capabilities. A full track offers continuum sensitivity of 200 or 500 =
micro-Jy (1 sigma) at 230 or 345 GHz in good weather conditions =
(precipitable water vapor 2.5mm and 1.0mm, respectively). The =
corresponding line sensitivities at 1 km/s resolution are 30 and 70 mJy. =
The small antennas allow access to low spatial frequencies in the =
sub-compact configuration and the finest angular resolution at 345 GHz =
in the very extended configuration is ~ 0.25". Thus, in some ways, the =
characteristics of the SMA may be both similar and complementary to =
those of the stand-alone Atacama Compact Array (ACA) component of ALMA.=20=
