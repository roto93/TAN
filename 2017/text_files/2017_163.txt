Dear colleague,

Please find below announcement of postdoc opportunities at ASIAA.

best regards,
Yen-Ting Lin

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA) in
Taipei, Taiwan, has openings for postdoctoral positions.  We seek for
candidates (1) to participate in the Institute's projects, including
Subaru HSC and PFS surveys, SDSS-IV, TAOS-2, ALMA, SMA, JCMT, VLBI
with the Greenland telescope, and Y.T. Lee Array; (2) to pursue
theoretical or observational studies of planetary and solar system
science, star and planet formation, galaxy formation, cosmology,
computational fluid dynamics, or MHD; or (c) to participate in
instrumentation development for optical/IR/submm telescopes.

ASIAA has approximately 200 staff, including 41 faculty members.
ASIAA has access to forefront observing facilities including ALMA,
SMA, SMA, JCMT, CFHT, and Subaru Telescope.  We are partners in the
Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) and Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS)
projects, and are a member of the SDSS-IV and LSST Surveys.  The Y.T.
Lee Array on Mauna Loa will conduct intensity mapping of CO rotational
transitions.  The Greenland Telescope will conduct submm VLBI
observations of shadows of supermassive black holes and related
sciences.  The TAOS-2 project will soon conduct a survey of small
objects beyond Neptune via occultation and other time-domain sciences
at San Pedro MÃ¡rtir. Theoretical and computational astrophysics is
pursued in our theoretical division, TIARA.  The CHARMS project aims
to develop numerical simulators to bridge observations and theories in
fluid dynamics, astrochemistry, and radiative transfer, using
algorithms and techniques utilizing the CPUs and GPUs.  A focus on the
Origins of Solar Systems is being built upon experimental works in our
in-house nanoSIMS facility.  More info on our projects can be found on
ASIAA website (http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/project/).

ASIAA offers excellent research facilities and an international
environment (~55 foreign members from 18 countries), with English
being the working language.  The postdoc appointments will initially
be for two years, with possible extension for additional two years
based on satisfactory performance.

Applicants should hold a Ph.D. degree in astronomy/astrophysics,
physics, engineering or equivalent fields.  Those who are expecting to
receive a PhD degree soon can also apply. Applicants should apply
online (https://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/jobopening/application.php?i=02a16d5f90c3256a2e7e6d1fa44424ca)
and submit:
(1) a curriculum vitae,
(2) a publication list,
(3) a summary of past and current research or instrumentation
experience (limited to 3 pages),
(4) a plan for future research (limited to 3 pages of text, with at
most 2 additional pages for figures and references).
Applicants are also requested to arrange three letters of
recommendation to be submitted online at the same site.  Applications
and three letters of recommendation submitted by or on 15 November
2017 will receive full consideration.
