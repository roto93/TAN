*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________
Speaker:        Hayato Shimabukuro (Observatoire de Paris)
Topic:          21cm cosmology meets artificial neural networks
Time:           4/12 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
The 21 cm signal from the Epoch of Reionization should be observed within the next decade. To extract from the observed data constraints on the parameters describing the underlying astrophysical processes, inversion methods must be developed. Here we test possible inversion method for EoR parameter reconstruction: artificial neural networks (ANN). We find that the quality of the parameter reconstruction depends on the sensitivity of the power spectrum to the different parameters at a given redshift, that including thermal noise and sample variance decreases the quality of the reconstruction and that using the power spectrum at several redshifts as an input to the ANN improves the quality of the reconstruction.

Supplemental Call for Proposals to use the 7-m Array in Cycle 4

The ALMA Director announces that the Joint ALMA Observatory (JAO) will accept
observing proposals that request to use the 7-m Array in the remainder
of Cycle 4, which ends on September 30, 2017. This proposal call enables
the community to propose projects that will fill in undersubscribed
regions of the observing queue for the 7-m Array. Up to 800 hours on the
7-m Array will be allocated through this opportunity.

Proposals must be compatible with the capabilities listed in the ALMA Cycle 4
Call for Proposals, with the following restrictions:

Proposals for this special call will be accepted only for the 7-m Array in stand-alone mode.
Proposals that request the Total Power (TP) Array or the 12-m Array will be declined.
A proposal may request up to 50 hours of observing time on the 7-m Array. We encourage
large time requests within this limit.
Proposals will be accepted in Bands 3, 4, 6, and 7 for any LST, except between LST of 15 h
and 20 h in Bands 6 and 7. The largest amount of time available in any
band is at an LST of > 22 h and < 13 h.
Only proposals that request standard modes are permitted, as defined in the
ALMA Cycle 4 Proposerãƒ»s Guide.


Proposals can be submitted starting April 21, 2017 and will be reviewed as they are
received. Instructions on how to submit a proposal through the ALMA
Observing Tool (OT) will be made available on the ALMA Science Portal on
April 21. Proposals can be submitted at any time up until the end of
Cycle 4 or until the available time has been fully allocated. An
announcement will be posted on the ALMA Science Portal when this
opportunity closes.
