*** Special Seminar ***
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Erwin Lau (Yale)
Topic:         Modeling baryonic physics in galaxy clusters
Time:         1/9 (Monday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
Galaxy clusters play an important role in modern precision cosmology. As the most massive virialized objects in the universe, their abundance depends sensitively on cosmological parameters. However, uncertainties in galaxy cluster physics pose serious challenges to using forthcoming observations to make advances in cosmology with galaxy clusters. 

In this talk, I will highlight how we can improve our understanding of galaxy cluster physics with the state-of-the-art numerical simulations and semi-analytical modelling. In particular, I will present results from the "Omega500" simulation, a high-resolution hydrodynamic simulation suite of galaxy cluster formation that follows the evolution of dark matter and baryons in a realistic cosmological setting. I will also outline upcoming challenges in the computational modelling of major physical processes in galaxy clusters, and how we can address them in anticipation of upcoming multi-wavelength cluster surveys in the next decade.

Topic:         the Chinese large optical telescope projects
Time:         1/9 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00

Topic:         Winds from black hole accretion systems
Time:         1/9 (Monday) 13:15 - 14:15
Place:         R1108
Abstract:
One of the most important recent advances of black hole accretion theory is the finding, based on numerical simulations, of winds from accretion disks.
The theoretical finding of this wind is also confirmed by observations.
In this talk, I will introduce the finding history and driving mechanism of these winds from accretion disks.
Finally, I will explain some observations based on the black hole wind model.

Topic:         Formation of Complex Organics in Dark Clouds
- Sweet results from the laboratory -
Time:         1/10 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
Complex organic molecules (COMs) have been not only observed in hot cores of low- and high-mass protostars, but also were detected recently in cold dense clouds. Besides energetic processing of ices that were shown to produce organic species, it is interesting to understand COM formation also under dense cloud conditions, i.e., without the presence of embedded energy sources. We present our latest laboratory study of the low-temperature (15 K) solid state formation of three complex molecules â€“ methyl formate (HC(O)OCH3), glycolaldehyde (HC(O)CH2OH) and ethylene glycol (H2C(OH)CH2OH) â€“ through recombination of active intermediate radicals. These free radicals are formed via H-atom addition and abstraction reactions along the COâ†’H2COâ†’CH3OH hydrogenation network, which starts from CO gas accreted on the grain that successively reacts with H-atoms to form H2CO and CH3OH. The present work extends on a recent CO hydrogenation study and aims to resemble the physical-chemica!
l conditions typical of dark molecular clouds. We confirm that H2CO, once formed by hydrogenation of CO, not only leads to CH3OH through forward addition reactions, but is also subject to backward abstractions induced by H-atoms, yielding CO again. In a similar way, H2CO is also the product of abstraction reactions of CH3OH. In this work, we show that the dominant intermediate radicals of CH3OH abstraction and H2CO addition reactions are CH2OH and CH3O, respectively. By considering both addition and abstration reactions, more reactive intermediates (HCO, CH3O and CH2OH) are produced in the ice mantle than previously thought, focussing on sequential H-atom addition reactions only. Inclusion of both types of reactions also enhances the probability to form COMs through radical-radical recombination without the need of UV photolysis or cosmic rays bombardment as external triggers. The formation of COMs realized in this way, is proven by RAIRS and TPD, also using isotopically la!
belled species.

Speaker:    Francesco Costagliola (Chalmers University of Technology)
Topic:         Tracing the AGN/Starburst co-evolution in compact obscured nuclei
Time:         1/11 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
Observations at all redshifts suggest that the AGN and starburst evolution across cosmic time are tightly linked. The recent discovery of ubiquitous giant molecular outflows revealed that even low-luminosity AGN can have a profound impact in the evolution and star-formation history of galaxies. The compact obscured nuclei of IR-luminous galaxies have been suggested to be the ideal targets to study the early stages of the Starburst/AGN interaction. However, because of the large extinction, standard Starburst/AGN tracers cannot be used to probe the central regions of these objects and new, more sensitive methods must be developed. Here I will report some of the latest results in the study of obscured AGN/Staburst  activity including observations with ALMA and the JVLA.
