*** CompAS Seminar ***
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Daniel Pfenniger (University of Geneva)
Topic:         Pattern speeds in galaxies
Time:         1/16 (Monday) 13:15 - 14:15
Place:         R1108
Abstract:
While developing several methods to extract scalar and 3D-vector pattern speeds from datasets of particles or stars, we found that the notion itself of pattern speed needs reconsideration since in live disk simulations slightly different results are obtained by different methods depending on what is assumed about a "pattern". This comes essentially from the fact that real disk systems are never strictly rigid, so some degree of time-dependence is always present and can be quantified. Situations similar to the Galaxy, including a bar and spiral arms, will be discussed. One of the investigated methods is particularly promising for Gaia-type datasets for determining the pattern speeds of local spiral arms or the Galaxy bar because it is insensitive to dust extinction.
