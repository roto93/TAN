Abstract

Complex organic compounds of mixed aromatic/aliphatic structures are now known to be widespread in the Universe, ranging from objects in our solar system to distant galaxies.  Spectral signatures of complex organics can be found as early as 10 billion years ago, but the origin of these organics is not known.  Through the techniques of millimeter-wave spectroscopy, over 170 molecules have been identified through their rotational transitions.  The list contains organic molecules of every kind, including hydrocarbons, alcohols, acids, aldehydes, amines, ethers, etc.  Space infrared spectroscopy has detected the stretching and bending modes of compounds with aromatic and aliphatic structures and showed that complex organic compounds can be synthesized in evolved stars over periods as short as several hundred years.  Analyses of samples of meteorites, comets, asteroids, and interplanetary dust also reveals a rich content of organic substances, some of which could be of extra-sola!
r origin.  How complex organics can be synthesized under very low density conditions over very short time scales represent a major challenge in astrochemistry.

We review the current state of understanding of the origin, evolution, nature, and distribution of organic matter in space.  The possibility of existence of primordial organics on Earth and the implications of extraterrestrial organics on the origin of life on Earth will be discussed.  Also discussed are a number of unexplained astronomical phenomena whose origins could be traced to organic carriers.

Speaker:    Masanori Nakamura (ASIAA)
Topic:         Fundamentals of MHD Jets
Time:         10/2 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
The Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) jet/wind model, which is the very popular theory of astrophysical jets (in such as YSOs and AGNs), is briefly discussed. The "magneto-centrifugal" (MC) acceleration (Blandford & Payne 1982, MNRAS, hereafter BP82) plays a primal role in sub-Alfvenic regime, but there are many misunderstandings in the literature. It is nice to consider the MC process in the inertial frame to see what is essential for the MC acceleration. The standard solution of BP82 includes the magnetic pressure gradient (MPG) acceleration; both the MC and the MPG process would take place in a single streamline of the MHD jet in trans-Alfvenic regime. The talk aims to share fundamentals of MHD jets with undergraduate knowledge, especially with those who are not experts in this field.

Speaker:    Sun Kwok (Univ. of Hong Kong)
Topic:         Organic Matter in the Universe: from solar system to distant galaxies
Time:         10/5 (Thursday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
Recent observational and experimental evidence for the presence of complex organics in space is reviewed.  Remote astronomical observations have detected ~200 gas-phase molecules through their rotational and vibrational transitions.  Many classes of organic molecules are represented in this list, including some precursors to biological molecules.  A number of unidentified spectral phenomena observed in the interstellar medium are likely to have originated from complex organics.  The observation of these features in distant galaxies suggests that organic synthesis had already taken place during the early epochs of the Universe.  
>
In the Solar System, almost all biologically relevant molecules can be found in the soluble component of carbonaceous meteorites.  Complex organics of mixed aromatic and aliphatic structures are present in the insoluble component of meteorites.  Hydrocarbons cover much of the surface of the planetary satellite Titan and complex organics are found in comets and interplanetary dust particles.  The possibility that the early Solar System, or even the early Earth, have been enriched by interstellar organics is discussed.
