The primary goal of the summer school is to provide an overview of the

analysis, machine learning methods, and visualization as applied to 
current and future surveys.

the participants are limited to 50 graduate or advanced undergraduate 
students from within Taiwan and internationally.  Local lodging will 
be provided to up to 40 students with priorities given to graduate 
students.
