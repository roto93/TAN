1st Announcement

Star Formation in Different Environment (SFDE) 2017:
    from Local Clouds to Distant Galaxies

International Center for Interdisciplinary Science and Education
   in Vietnam (ICISE), Quy Nhon, Vietnam, 6 - 12 August 2017

http://rencontresduvietnam.org/conferences/2017/sfde2017/


Building upon the success of the SFDE16 conference held in ICISE, Quy
Nhon, Vietnam, we will get together again in 2017 to discuss about the
recent progress in star formation from local clouds to distant galaxies.
The conference will highlight the recent advances in wide-field and high
resolution surveys and detail numerical simulations of star formation in
different environments, from individual star to galaxy systems. The idea
is to search for a universal picture of star formation across all scales
and also identify the characteristics of each individual scale.

The goal of the conference is to share the different views from
different research communities by balancing contributions from different
categories and to encourage collaborations between researchers across
the Globe. Depending on the demand, we might continue as SFDExSeries in
the next years. Focus group meetings also allow more specific topic
discussion. Ample time is set aside to encourage discussions and
collaboration.



Deadlines:
- Oral abstract submission deadline: 30 April, 2017
- Poster abstract submission deadline: 30 April, 2017
- Early registration deadline: 06 Jun, 2017
- Final registration deadline: 16 July, 2017

The number of participants will be limited to around 80, so that all
participants will be accommodated in the same hotel Seagull. Priority
will be given to speakers and poster presenters and early registration
participants.

Registration fee is 350 USD (early bird) or 420 USD (normal).
Accommodation + meal (breakfast, lunch, dinner) fee for the entire
conference duration (6 nights) is 450 USD for a single room and 315 USD
per person for a double room.



Conference venue

The conference will be organized at the International Center for
Interdisciplinary Science and Education in Vietnam (ICISE) by Rencontres
du Vietnam, a scientific non-profit organization. The venue is located
at a beautiful beach in Vietnam, thus allowing participants also to
enjoy the nature, culture while having rich scientific discussion. ICISE
in the city of Quy Nhon (Central Vietnam) has the ambitious objective to
focus on developing science and education, helping young Asian students
and scientists to meet with the international science community,
bringing the opportunity to accelerate their knowledge by attending
lectures and sharing ideas with overseas high-level counterparts.

Topic:          The impacts of cosmic ray heating on star formation in high-redshift galaxies
Time:           4/6 (Thursday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Young galaxies with strong star formation activity are likely sources of
cosmic ray particles. At high-energies, these particles interact with
the baryon and radiation fields of the galactic environment via
hadronuclear, photo-pair and photo-pion processes to produce charged and
neutral pions, neutrons and protons. At lower energies, they can
interact by collisional ionization. In both cases, the effect is to
drive a heating process in the interstellar medium and beyond. The
distribution of this heating effect is governed by the galactic magnetic
field in the case of low-energy cosmic rays which effectively become
‘locked’ and diffuse predominantly along field lines. At high-energies,
the cosmic ray heating is governed more strongly by the multi-phase
interstellar density field, with the particles being more freely able to
diffuse throughout the magnetic field. This talk addresses the
interactions between these low and high-energy particles and the
partially ionised gases and dense molecular clouds in starbursting
protogalactic environments. We calculate the energy deposited by cosmic
rays as they propagate in and around their host galaxy and demonstrate
how this affects the thermal conditions and star formation in the host
galaxy and its neighbours.

Title: Exploring the 5:1 Neptune Resonance:
        Dynamics, Population, and Origin

Abstract:
The long-term evolution of objects in the outer n:1 resonances with
Neptune provide clues to the evolutionary history of the Solar System.
Based on 4 objects with semi-major axes near the 5:1 Neptune resonance,
we estimate a substantial and previously unrecognized population of
objects, perhaps more significant than the population in the 3:2 (Plutino)
resonance.

Understanding the characteristics and trapping history for
objects in these populations is critical for constraining the dynamical
history of the solar system. The 4 objects detected in the Canada-France
Ecliptic Plane Survey (CFEPS) were classified using dynamical
integrations. Three are resonant, and the fourth appears to be a
resonance diffusion object, part of a population which exited the
resonance through chaotic diffusion.

The dynamical behavior of the known objects, suggests that the
trapping mechanism for the 5:1 resonance is resonance sticking
from the scattering objects. This is consistent with the measured
surface colors of the objects. However, our investigations
of Solar System evolution models show that they do not emplace a
sufficiently large population into this resonance, and the source
of this large population remains unexplained.
