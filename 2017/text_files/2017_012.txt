Call for abstract for APRIM 2017 (Deadline March 1, 2017) 

Dear colleagues: 

The 13th Asian-Pacific Regional IAU Meeting (APRIM) will be 
held at the International Convention Center in Taipei, Taiwan on 
July 3-7, 2017. 

APRIM is authorized by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) 
to be held every three years with the aim to promote scientific 
activity and collaboration in the Asian-Pacific region.  This is the 
first first time Taiwan hosts an APRIM. 

We would like to encourage all astronomers in Taiwan to attend 
this APRIM meeting and to present your latest results to our 
colleagues and friends in neighboring regions. 

The APRIM 2017 website is now open for registration and abstract 
submission. The deadline for abstract submission is March 1, 2017. 
Please check details here: http://www.aprim2017.tw/ 
We hope to see you at APRIM 2017. 

Best regards, 
You-Hua Chu 
on behalf of the SOC and LOC of APRIM2017
