FYI



The 1st circular of the East-Asia AGN Workshop 2017
4-6 December 2017 in Kagoshima, Japan
https://cosmos.phys.sci.ehime-u.ac.jp/~takuji/eaagn2017/index.php

Workshop rationale:
It is our pleasure to announce that we are organizing a workshop entitled 
"East-Asia AGN Workshop 2017" held on 4th-6th December 2017 in 
Kagoshima, Japan. This is the fifth meeting of a series of workshops for 
East Asian collaborations in the AGN/SMBH field. The East-Asia AGN 
Workshop aims at fostering close collaborations among AGN/SMBH 
researchers in East Asian countries. Research collaborations in East Asia 
are getting more important recently, given various opportunities provided 
by East Asian Observatory (JCMT, Subaru, ...) and also on-going and 
future large international projects such as ALMA, TMT, and GMT. We 
believe that this workshop will provide various opportunity to foster new 
collaborations for tackling exciting mysteries in the AGN/SMBH field.

Important dates:
Early April 2017: 1st circular
Middle June: 2nd circular & registration open
Middle September: deadline for registration & abstract submission
Middle October: 3rd circular & program announcement
Late November: final circular
Early December: workshop

Speaker:    Min-Kai Lin (ASIAA)
Topic:         Dusty disk-planet simulations
Time:         4/17 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
I will present ongoing simulations to study the interaction between protoplanetary disks and embedded protoplanets using a modified version of the PLUTO code. I will show how dusty disk-planet torques can differ from that in pure gas disks, which is considered in most previous studies.


*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Andrew Youdin (University of Arizona)
Topic:         The Route to Planetesimals
Time:         4/19 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
It has long been difficult to understand how dust grains could grow past the “meter-size barrier” to become super-km scale planetesimals, the solid building blocks of planets.  Daunting obstacles include the  rapid radial drift of solids towards the star and the tendency of many collisions to result in destruction or bouncing instead of growth. The route to  planetesimals focuses on two broad mechanisms.  First finding the circumstances that may lead to more effective collisional growth towards or even beyond the meter-size barrier.  Second, (aero)dynamical mechanisms to concentrate smaller solids into gravitationally bound planetesimals.  The classic dynamical mechanism is a gravitational instability of the particle disk.  In the streaming instability mechanism, drag forces and radial drift can automatically produce strong particle clumps.  Recent simulations have explored the viability of the streaming instability across a broad range of parameter space.  I wil!
l asses the viability of the streaming instability and other planetesimal formation mechanisms, including a discussion of the large scale dust structures observed in protoplanetary disks.


*** Special Seminar ***
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Laurent Pagani (Observatoire de Paris)
Topic:         Deuterium, a swiss-knife to study star-formation
Time:         4/21 (Friday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
Though we understand the main steps which lead from diffuse gas to a newborn star with its nascent planets, a number of details remain obscur and need clarification. One of the least understood steps is the formation and collapse of the prestellar core, in the dark cloud. This is due to the core being extremely cold (down to 6 K), deeply embedded in the cloud and largely depleted of most molecular species. Therefore almost no tracer is available to study this phase in detail. Apart from dust itself (it would require a second talk to discuss it), the main tracers are H2D+, N2H+, N2D+ and DCO+ (the NH3 family is another possibility). 3 species out of 4 carry a Deuterium. Why are they abundant enough to be detected when the cosmic D/H ratio is as low as 10^-5 and what can we learn from their presence ? In the presentation, I will illustrate 3 different measurements we can perform thanks to the peculiar deuterium chemistry: the age of clouds, the age of prestellar cores and the !
depletion profile of CO and N2 in these cores, which is a prerequisite to study the interaction of grain surface chemistry (ices) with the gas phase in the dense cores. Deuterium appears as a swiss-knife to study star formation.

Dear Colleagues in Astronomy and Astrophysics,

The Cross-Strait Symposium of Astrophysics, previously the ASIAA-SHAO
bilateral workshop, will be held in the Institute of Astronomy and
Astrophysics, Academia Sinica, on July 1-3, ending at noon on July 3, to be
followed by the APRIM.

This symposium series alternates between the two sides of the Strait,
hosted by one participating Institution approximately every one and half
year. The activities through hosting symposia aim to promote interactions
of individual research areas of working Astronomers and Astrophysicists,
instrumentation, and theoretical modeling and computational simulations in
Astrophysics, originally motivated by the proximity and complementarity of
Institutions across the Strait. This year, the symposium will take place in
the ASIAA. In addition to colleagues in ASIAA and Universities in Taiwan,
colleagues from University of Science and Technology of China (in Hefei,
Anhui, USTC), the Shanghai Astronomical Observatory, and Principal
Investigators from key laboratories in China will join. Topics to be
discussed and interacted include all major research directions from large
scales to small scales: Cosmology, Black Holes and Active Galactic Nuclei,
Galaxies, Stars, the Solar System, and the Exoplanets, as well as active
instrumentation and telescope accesses. It is anticipated that common areas
and interests with strong and developmental advantages will be identified
and further cultivated through mutual communications and exchanges.

The registration is open through the link here:

https://events.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/conference/20170701/registration.php

We appreciate your participation and the program will be prepared based on
local and mutual interests, and showcases of efforts across the Strait.

Cheers,

Hsien Shang

> Subject: announcement: TIARA summer school on Astrostatistics and Big Data

Dear Prof. Kuan, 

Could you please help advertise the TIARA summer school on TAN? 

thanks, 
yen-ting 

----------------------------------------------- 

Dear all, 

We are pleased to announce the 2017 TIARA summer school on 
Astrostatistics and Big Data, to be held at ASIAA on 9/4-8: 
http://events.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/school/20170904/ 

The primary goal of the summer school is to provide an overview of the 
emerging field of astrostatistics in the landscape of Big Data.  We 
have a great lineup of lecturers, and the tentative lecture topics 
include fundamentals of statistics, image processing, time series 
analysis, machine learning methods, and visualization as applied to 
current and future surveys. 

The registration is now open 
(https://events.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/school/20170904/registration.php); 
the participants are limited to 50 graduate or advanced undergraduate 
students from within Taiwan and internationally.  Local lodging will 
be provided to up to 40 students with priorities given to graduate 
students. 

best regards, 
Yen-Ting Lin 
for the organizing committee: 
Yen-Chi Chen, Bau-Ching Hsieh, Matt Lehner, Yen-Ting Lin, Sheng-Yuan 
Liu, Ai-Lei Sun, Ronald Taam, Keiichi Umetsu, Wei-Hao Wang
