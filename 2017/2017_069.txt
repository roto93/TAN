Dear Colleagues.

We invite proposals for the open use observations of the Korean VLBI
Network.

- Call for Proposals 2017B (KVN VLBI)
The Korean VLBI Network (KVN, http://kvn.kasi.re.kr/) invites scientific
proposals for VLBI observations during the 2017B season from Astronomers
over the world. Observations of successful proposals will be scheduled
between 15th August 2017 and 15th January 2018. Proposals should be emailed
to kvnprop@kasi.re.kr before the deadline of UT 08:00 (KST 17:00) on 1st
June 2017.

- Korean VLBI Network (KVN)
The Korean VLBI Network (KVN) is a dedicated mm-VLBI network, operated by
Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute (KASI, http://www.kasi.re.kr).
Its three 21m radio telescopes are located in Seoul, Ulsan and Jeju Island
around South Korea. The baseline lengths ranges from 305km to 476 km. Its 4-
channel receiving system allows simultaneous observation at 22, 43, 86, and
129 GHz. From this call, higher than 1 Gbps recording rates (2, 4 and 8
Gbps)
using Mark6 recorder are available. Total machine time of 300 hours are
planned for this call. The maximum observation time of a proposal will be
limited to 100 hours. If requested in the proposals, the observation time
can be allocated over a year, until June 15, 2018, for this call. But the
observation time will not be increased. Details of the information and
current status of the KVN can be found in the KVN VLBI Status Report.
http://radio.kasi.re.kr/kvn/status_report_2017/array.html
Proposer should fill the KVN VLBI proposal form (tex file can be found at
http://kvn.kasi.re.kr/index.html/obs_proposal.php). Please carefully follow
the instruction of the proposal form. A separate scientific and technical
justification is mandatory. This Justification should be submitted together
with the proposal form and not exceed 3 pages.
