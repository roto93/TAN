First announcement 

Magnetic fields along the star-formation sequence: bridging polarization-sensitive views

Focus Meeting 4 at the IAU General Assembly 
Vienna (Austria) 
August 30-31, 2018 

https://escience.aip.de/iau30-fm4/



Dear colleagues,

We invite you to join us at the 2018 IAU General Assembly for a Focus Meeting dedicated to the role of magnetic fields in the star-formation process.

In this Focus Meeting we wish to gather the different communities working with magnetized models and polarimetric observations of the various stages and objects along the star formation sequence, from molecular clouds to young stars reaching the main sequence. 

The goal is to discuss how to compare constraints on magnetic fields at different evolutionary stages and physical scales in order to establish a coherent view of their role in the multi-scale process of star formation. Combining observational results and theoretical expectations from different communities is complex, so we especially welcome contributions that will emphasize how different measurements of magnetic fields can be compared and interpreted in a coherent way, despite the widely varying observing techniques, objects, and physical scales that are involved in studies across the star-formation sequence.

Note that registration for IAU GA 2018 and payment of the corresponding fees will be handled by the IAU General Assembly organizers and are mandatory to participate in the event!  See submission details below.

We look forward to seeing you in Vienna in August, 2018!

*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Neal Turner (NASA/JPL)
Topic:         Starlight Reshapes Planetary Nurseries
Time:         10/17 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
Many protostellar disks show central cavities, rings or spiral arms
likely caused by low-mass stellar or planetary companions, yet few
such features are conclusively tied to bodies embedded in the disks.
Even small features on the disk's surface cast shadows, because the
starlight grazes the surface.  We therefore focus on accurately
computing the disk's thickness, which depends on its temperature.  We
present models with temperatures set by the balance between starlight
heating and radiative cooling, and that are in vertical hydrostatic
equilibrium.  The planet has 20, 100, or 1000 Earth masses, ranging
from barely enough to perturb the disk significantly, to clearing a
deep tidal gap.  The hydrostatic balance strikingly alters the model
disk's appearance.  The planet-carved gap's outer wall puffs up under
starlight heating, throwing a shadow across the disk beyond.  The
shadow appears in scattered light as a dark ring that could be
mistaken for a gap opened by another planet.  The surface brightness
contrast between outer wall and shadow for the 100-Earth-mass planet
is almost an order of magnitude greater than a model neglecting the
temperature disturbances.  The shadow is so deep it largely hides the
planet-launched spiral wave's outer arm.  Temperature gradients are
such that outer low-mass planets undergoing orbital migration will
converge within the shadow.  Furthermore, the temperature
perturbations affect the shape, size and contrast of features at
millimeter and centimeter wavelengths.  Thus, starlight heating and
radiative cooling are key factors in the appearance of protostellar
disks with embedded planets.



*** Special Seminar ***
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Sergei A. Levshakov (A. F. Ioffe Physical-Technical Institute)
Topic:         Probing the fundamental constants of nature over cosmological time-scales
Time:         10/19 (Thursday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
The measurements of the fundamental constants of nature - the fine structure constant, alpha, and the electron-to-proton mass ratio, mu - using astronomical spectra of atoms and molecules are reviewed. The current results obtained from observations of dark clouds in the Milky Way, HII zones in the neighbouring galaxy M33, and high-redshift galaxies at z ~ 6 are summarized. Prospects for future observations are discussed.

Dear all, 

We have a meeting aiming to promote planetary nebula (PN, e.g. Ring Nebula) 
and related science cases using the Subaru Telescope amongst researchers 
in potential partner countries (Taiwan, China, Korea, Australia). 
This meeting is officially supported by NAOJ.

The meeting (Dec 11-13) is hold at the university of Hong Kong immediately 
after asymmetric planetary nebulae IV meeting in Hong Kong. 

We would like to spend a good chunk of time developing actual proposals 
using the current instruments and future delivered instruments such as PSF, 
and discussing international operation. 
More on this workshop can be found at the URL below:

http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/~otsuka/subaruws/subaruws.html

or email me.

Best,
Masaaki Otsuka
on behalf of the Subaru PN WS SOC/LOC.
