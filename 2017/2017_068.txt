********************************
Call for Proposals of KaVA (KVN and VERA Array) 2017B
Deadline:  1st June, 2017, 08:00 UT
*********************************

Dear Colleagues.

We invite proposals for the open use observations of the KaVA,
http://radio.kasi.re.kr/kava/main_kava.php
a joint VLBI array
of the KVN (Korean VLBI Network) and the VERA (VLBI exploration of Radio
Astrometry). The joint array consists of three 21-m KVN telescopes and
four 20-m VERA telescopes, with baseline lengths ranging from 300 km to
2300 km.

This open use call will be based on risk-share, and provide VLBI
observations at
22GHz and 43GHz for astronomers in the world.
We support astronomers in the preparation of proposals, scheduling, and
data analysis.
For that reason, pIf proposers who are not familiar with KaVA, they are
recommended to include
at least one collaborator from VERA or KVN. If it is difficult to find
collaborators
from VERA or KVN, please consult us to find one.
The contact address for the support
is kavaprop (at-mark) kasi.re.kr.

In order to avoid conflict and/or duplication of the targets between open
use proposals
and LPswith existing KaVA Large Programs, proposers are highly recommended
to visit KaVA Large Program (LP) webpage where KaVA LPs and their source
list are presented.
http://radio.kasi.re.kr/kava/large_programs.php

If the open use proposals can not be achieved with the data of LPs,
then they will be accepted as separate open use observations.
Otherwise, we encourage the proposers to collaborate with the science teams
of
the corresponding KaVA LPs.
Observations will be conducted with single polarization (LCP) and 1-Gbps
data rate.
The total available observation time is up to 250 hours and the
observations will be
scheduled between 15th August 2017 and 15th January 2018. The maximum
observing
time per proposal is limited to 100 hours.
If requested in the proposals, the observation time can be allocated over a
year,
until 15th June 2018, for this call. But the observation time will be still
limited to 100 hours.
The deadline of submission is at 08:00 UT on 1st June 2017.
Detailed information on the KaVA call-for-proposal can be found in
http://radio.kasi.re.kr/kava/proposal_info.php

ToO opportunity
It is strongly recommended that Target of Opportunity proposals (especially
expected ToO)
are submitted to regular CfP of KaVA.
Unexpected or urgent ToO can be submitted to ask =E2=80=98Director=E2=80=99=
s time=E2=80=99 at any
time.
These proposals must include specific triggering criteria to initiate an
observation.
The ToO is valid for one year when it is approved. The proposals to
Director's time
must be submitted by PDF files using e-mail to kavaprop (at-mark) kasi.re.kr

Recovery Observation

If an open use observation has more than one missing stations due to system
trouble
and/or very severe weather condition (e.g. strong wind by typhoon),
PI can request recovery observation within a year after receiving the
correlated data.
PI should resubmit the proposal which should clarify the necessity of
recovery observation.
The KaVA TAC will consider the time allocation of the recovery observations
for the next season.


If you have any questions, please send an email to kavaprop (at-mark)
kasi.re.kr

Sincerely,

                  Hyun-Goo Kim

Speaker:    Kota Naito (ASIAA/NTU)
Topic:         Statistical Study on Organic Inclusions in Meteorites
Time:         4/24 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:         R1203


*** Special Seminar ***

Speaker:    Jesus Toala (ASIAA)
Topic:         X-ray Emission as a probe of Stellar Evolution
Time:         4/24 (Monday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
Very massive stars are the main actors in shaping and chemically enriching the ISM in the 
galaxies we see. They do so by a combination of their stellar winds, proper motions, strong 
ionising photon fluxes, and supernova explosions. These produce cavities in the ISM that can
be studied with X-ray observatories. In this talk I review our current understanding of the 
production of diffuse X-ray emission towards the nebulae carved by massive stellar feedback.


*** Colloquium ***

Speaker:    Ai-Lei Sun (ASIAA)
Topic:         The many facets of AGN feedback -- a multi-wavelength view of galactic outflows
Time:         4/26 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
Active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback is now a standard ingredient in galaxy evolution models. Popular models suggest that during the quasar phase, gas is driven out of the galaxy in the form of outflows, shutting off star-formation and black hole growth, leading to the observed quiescent galaxy population and the black hole -- galaxy correlations, but many assumptions require observational supports. Observations have discovered galactic outflow in the luminous quasar, but their structure is surprisingly complex, involving a wide range of gas phases from cold molecules to hot X-ray emitting gas. Multi-wavelength coverage is needed for a comprehensive picture. I summarize recent optical, radio, and X-ray observations of AGN outflows in nearby luminous quasars, and what do we learn about their occurrence rate, composition, and energetics, as well as the life cycles of AGN feedback. I end with discussing how on-going and future optical surveys could help us study this rare and !
intriguing phenomenon of AGN feedback.

Title: Interstellar scintillation as micro-arcsecond
        scale probes of compact radio AGNs

Abstract:

The variability of compact AGNs on timescales of hours and days observed
at cm-wavelengths is predominantly caused by scattering in the ionized
interstellar medium (ISM) of our Galaxy. With the ISM as an AU-scale
interferometer, interstellar scintillation (ISS) provides an exquisite
probe of the micro-arcsecond scale structure of AGNs.

I present results from the Micro-arcsecond Scintillation-Induced 
Variability (MASIV) Survey of ~500 compact AGNs and its follow-up 
observations. I will discuss the dependence of ISS on intrinsic AGN 
properties, including their gamma-ray loudness, radio spectral indices, 
optical spectral classification, redshift, and intrinsic variability.
I will show how we have used ISS to probe the source size-redshift 
relation of compact AGNs, and place strong constraints on the
turbulent properties of the intervening intergalactic medium.

Future surveys of ISS with highly-sensitive instruments such as
the SKA will potentially probe the micro-arcsecond structure of
faint (~100 muJy to 10 mJy) AGNs, thereby complementing studies at 
comparable angular resolutions with Space-VLBI and mm-VLBI which
are limited only to the brightest AGNs.

Tea/Discussion Time is followed !  All Welcome !!
