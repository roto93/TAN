Riechers (Cornell).  Please find his title+abstract below.  Also note
that his talk will be in the auditorium on 1F.

The Intricate Role of Cold Gas and Dust in Galaxy Evolution at Early
Cosmic Epochs

Dusty starburst galaxies at very high redshift represent an important
phase in the early evolution of massive galaxies. They typically
represent large-scale, gas-rich major mergers that trigger intense,
short-lived bursts of star formation, which consume most of the
available gas and drive the morphological transition to spheroids. At
early cosmic epochs, these hyper-luminous galaxies commonly trace
regions of high galaxy overdensity, and may be directly related to the
formation of galaxy clusters and their giant central
ellipticals. Molecular and atomic gas plays a central role in our
understanding of the nature of these often heavily obscured distant
systems. It represents the material that stars form out of, and its
mass, distribution, excitation, and dynamics provide crucial insight
into the physical processes that support the ongoing star formation
and stellar mass buildup. I will discuss the most recent progress in
studies of the cold gas content of dusty starburst galaxies at high
redshift, back to the first billion years of cosmic time using CARMA,
the Jansky Very Large Array, the Plateau de Bure interferometer, and
the Atacama Large (sub)Millimeter Array (ALMA). I will also highlight
our recent successful first detections of the interstellar medium in
"normal" (~L*) galaxies at z>5 with ALMA, and discuss the impact of
our findings on future studies back to even earlier epochs.
