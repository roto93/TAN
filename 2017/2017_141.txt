Dear all,

ALMA and the ARCs have been increasing the fraction of the observations
that go through the pipeline, for both calibration and imaging stages. More
and more PIs and archive users are encountering Scheduling Blocks (SB), the
basic constituents of an ALMA delivery, processed by the pipeline.

The ARC Taiwan node is organizing a short meeting for users interested in
learning more about he pipeline deliveries and how to modify its results.
The topics to be covered are:
- Basic structure and files found in an ALMA pipeline delivery
- Files/plots for quick assessment of calibration and imaging quality
- Way to change/modify the pipeline results
- Cases when is better to calibrate/image manually instead
- Examples

The meeting will be on September 15, from 1:30 to 3:30 pm. Users interested
in the
above topics are encouraged to attend.

ALMA provides some material that is expected to get more extensive as the
pipeline matures and provides for tools for users.
It is not necessary to read through the documents in advance however.
