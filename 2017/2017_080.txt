Dear colleagues,

The 2018 edition of Communicating Astronomy with the Public (CAP 2018) 
will take place in Fukuoka, Japan from 24 to 28 March 2018, organised by 
the IAU Commission C2, the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan 
(NAOJ) and Fukuoka City.

The Organising Committees invite professionals from science 
communication, informal education, planetariums and science centres, as 
well as professional and amateurs astronomers, journalists, and 
creatives, around the world to register for CAP 2018.

Registration and more information can be found on the Official Website 
here: http://communicatingastronomy.org/cap2018/

colleagues and to your community.

We are looking forward to continuing to collaborate with you all in the 
upcoming months.
Thank you once again for your support.
Best regards,

Speaker:    Satoki Matsushita (ASIAA)
Topic:         Working in Greenland in the Middle of Winter
Time:         5/8 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:         R1203


*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Kevin Koay (ASIAA)
Topic:         Interstellar scintillation as micro-arcsecond scale probes of compact radio AGNs
Time:         5/10 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
The variability of compact AGNs on timescales of hours and days observed at cm-wavelengths is predominantly caused by scattering in the ionized interstellar medium (ISM) of our Galaxy. With the ISM as an AU-scale interferometer, interstellar scintillation (ISS) provides an exquisite probe of the micro-arcsecond scale structure of AGNs. I present results from the Micro-arcsecond Scintillation-Induced Variability (MASIV) Survey of ~500 compact AGNs and its follow-up observations. I will discuss the dependence of ISS on intrinsic AGN properties, including their gamma-ray loudness, radio spectral indices, optical spectral classification, redshift, and intrinsic variability. I will show how we can use ISS to probe the source size-redshift relation of compact AGNs, and place strong constraints on the turbulent properties of the intervening intergalactic medium. Future surveys of ISS with highly-sensitive radio telescopes such as the SKA will potentially probe the micro-arcsecond s!
tructure of faint (~100 muJy to 10 mJy) AGNs, thereby complementing studies at comparable angular resolutions with Space-VLBI and mm-VLBI which at present are limited only to the brightest AGNs.

Time:         5/10 (Wednesday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
In this talk, I will mention why we need and quartz windows. 
And why using LDPE to reduce the reflection.
How we coated the LDPE ( Low-density polyethylene ) at the quartz surface.
And preliminary result.

Title: ALMA Observations of Spiral Accretion Flows
        Towards Extremely Young Protostars

Abstract:

Studying the accretion flows toward extremely young
protostars is an important step for understanding
how the protostars and the protoplanetary disks are
assembled in the early stage of star formation.
The accretion flows are commonly seen in the MHD
numerical simulations; however, it is rarely observed
toward young protostars.

Here we present our ALMA observations of the accretion
flows around the extremely young protostar VLA1623A with
a Keplerian disk likely just formed (Murillo, Lai,
et al. 2013). "Dendrogram" algorithm (Goodman et al.
2009) are used to identify the accretion flows, and
we find the three brightest "branches" and their
associated "leaves" likely correspond to the spiral
structure flowing toward the central young cluster.

We further compare the three accretion flows in the
position-position-velocity cube to the CMU model
(Ulrich 1976; Cassen & Moosman 1981) which describe
the velocity structure of the gas accreting to the
central protostar with constant angular momentum.
We find that our identified branch structures well
match with the CMU model.
