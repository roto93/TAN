Speaker:        Kouichi Hirotani (ASIAA)
Topic:          Emission from the direct vicinity of black holes
Time:           2/20 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
In a black hole magnetosphere, when the plasma accretion rate is much
lower than the Eddington limit, a strong electric field inevitably
appears along the magnetic field lines due to charge deficit.  In
such a charge-starved region (or a gap), the electric field accelerates
migratory electrons and positrons into ultra relativistic energies.
These relativistic leptons emit copious gamma-rays via curvature and
inverse-Compton (IC) processes. Some of such gamma-rays collide with
the submillimeter-IR photons emitted from the radiatively inefficient
accretion flow (RIAF) to materialize as pairs.  The created pairs
polarize to partially screen the original acceleration electric field.
By solving this pair-creation cascade self-consistently for the first
time, we find that the gap emissions from the direct vicinity of
stellar-mass, intermediate-mass, and super-massive black holes are
detectable with Fermi/LAT and Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes
(e.g., MAGIC, HESS, VERITAS, and CTA) when the accretion rate is
in a certain range.  Moreover, such HE/VHE gamma-ray fluxes are predicted
to exhibit anti-correlation with the RIAF submillimeter fluxes,
which enables us to discriminate the gap emission from the standard,
shock-in-jet model, e.g., by using ALMA and CTA.


*** Special Seminar ***

Speaker:        Kenneth Wong (NAOJ, EACOA Fellow)
Topic:          Cosmology from Gravitational Lens Time Delays
Time:           2/21 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Strong gravitational lens systems with time delays between the
multiple images are a powerful probe of cosmology and astrophysics. In
particular, the time-delay distance from such a system is primarily
sensitive to the Hubble constant (H0) that is key to probing dark
energy, neutrino physics, and the spatial curvature of the Universe,
as well as discovering new physics.  The H0 Lenses In COSMOGRAIL’s
Wellspring (H0LiCOW) project aims to measure H0 to <3.5% precision
from five lensed quasars using deep Hubble Space Telescope imaging,
precise time delay measurements from the COSMOGRAIL monitoring
project, a measurement of the velocity dispersion of the lens
galaxies, and a characterization of the mass distribution along the
line of sight.  The most recent H0LiCOW analysis of the system HE
0435-1223 is able to constrain the time-delay distance to a precision
of ~8%.  In combination with the previous two H0LiCOW lenses, we
constrain H0 to ~3.8% precision for a flat Lambda CDM cosmology,
independent of and competitive with the latest distance ladder
results.  The results are consistent with independent determinations
of H0 using the distance ladder method and are in moderate tension
with the latest Planck results for a similar cosmology, hinting at
possible new physics beyond the standard LCDM model and highlighting
the importance of this independent probe.

Speaker:        Pham Ngoc Diep (Vietnam National Satellite Center/Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology)
Topic:          Millimetre/Submillimetre Astronomy Studies of Evolved Stars, Protostars and High Redshift Galaxies
Time:           2/22 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
The observation of molecular emission at millimetre and submillimetre wavelengths gives access to the study of stars having a large and cool circumstellar envelope as well as of the gas reservoirs of galaxies, in particular remote galaxies with redshift in the 2 to 5 range at the epoch of maximum star formation rate. The observation of the continuum emission underneath the molecular excitation lines provides important information on the dust content. Using Plateau de Bure and archival ALMA observations, we have been able to reconstruct in space, under simplifying hypotheses such as of invariance by rotation about an axis, both the morphology and the kinematics of such sources. Examples will illustrate these studies, including Asymptotic Giant Branch stars, protostars and gravitationally lensed high redshift galaxies.

Dear Yi-Jehng,

I would appreciate it if you circulate the following announcement to TAN.

----------------

Dear all,

The NAOJ/Kagoshima University invite applications for a postdoctoral research position,
to work with Prof. Shigehisa Takakuwa in Kagoshima Univ. on observational studies of
star formation using the ALMA.

Regards,
Naomi Hirano @ ASIAA

----------
Specially Appointed Research Staff at the NAOJ Chile Observatory (Stationed at the Kagoshima University)

The NAOJ Chile Observatory invites applications for a Specially Appointed Research Staff to conduct the research project “ALMA Study of Disk Formation around Protostars” using ALMA data (including archival data). The selected applicant will spend 100% of the time for this project under the supervision of Professor Takakuwa at the Kagoshima University (1-21-35 Korimoto, Kagoshima, Kagoshima Prefecture, Japan). The selected applicant is required (1) to publish one paper using ALMA per year, and (2) to submit one ALMA proposal per year. The selected applicant may supervise students for the purpose of carrying out this project.

http://alma.mtk.nao.ac.jp/j/forresearchers/almagrant/images/almagrant_h29_takakuwa_en.pdf
for further information.

The candidate must have a Doctoral degree (PhD) or equivalent in a relevant field. The selected applicant will be employed by the NAOJ, and will be stationed at the Kagoshima University. In case the PI of the project (Prof. Takakuwa) moves to another university or institute, the selected candidate is expected to accompany the PI. However, if such an arrangement is deemed difficult by the new university/institute, the selected candidate will be relocated to NAOJ in Mitaka and continue the proposed research project.

In principle, the term is for two years from the starting date. NAOJ will conduct a review based on the mid-term performance report submitted by the PI and may extend the term for an additional year. For a researcher who has been employed by NINS (National Institutes of Natural Sciences) after April 1, 2013, his/her term will be set so that the total employment period from April 1, 2013 will be less than 10 years.

The starting date is negotiable, but must be between April 1st 2017 and March 31st 2018.

Interested candidates should prepare the documents in English, convert them to PDF (max 10MB per email) and send them to the e-mail address with a subject line “Application for ‘ALMA Study of Disk Formation around Protostars’”. Please contact us if you do not receive a reply within two working days.

(1) Cover letter with the title of the research project.
(2) Curriculum vitae
(3) Publication list (Separate refereed papers from others. State your role for co-authored papers.)
(4) PDF of three relevant papers
(5) Statement describing your commitment and plans for the job
(6) Two or more reference letters (must be sent directly to the e-mail address, before the deadline.)
(7) Your e-mail address and phone number

The application deadline is March 31, 2017, 15:00 (JST)

Inquiry about research project
takakuwa_atmark_sci.kagoshima-u.ac.jp
Submission and general inquiries
alma-grant-application_atmark_nao.ac.jp (replace _atmark_ with @)

The fellow will receive a monthly salary of 350,000 JPY plus compensation for commuting expenses. Social insurance will be applied. Bonus and retirement allowances are not provided.

Please note that once you are employed as a Specially Appointed Research Staff by NAOJ, you will not be eligible anymore for a NAOJ Project Research Fellow.

Title: There Is Life after Stellar Middle Age

Abstract:
The discovery of how stars function and evolve counts among the twentieth
century's greatest scientific achievements. In the twenty-first century
the problems that still challenge us are intrinsically multidimensional
and multiscale: star formation, supernovae, stellar convection and mass
loss, and common envelope evolution, among others. Given the extreme
conditions and large spatial and temporal ranges of stellar evolution, our
theoretical understanding of this subject rests heavily on numerical
simulations containing a mixture of modeling and first-principles
calculation. I will discuss the application of these techniques to the
evolution of common envelope systems and explain the potential
significance of advances in this area for a wide range of astrophysical
problems.

Tea/Discussion Time is followed !  All Welcome !!
