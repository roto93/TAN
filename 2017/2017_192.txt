Topic:          Forming stellar siblings: a look at the chemistry and physics of multiple stars
Time:           11/27 (Monday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Multiple stars are commonly found throughout our galaxy at all mass ranges. They are excellent stellar physics laboratories and the cause of many interesting phenomena such as certain types of supernovae, planetary nebulae and binary black holes.
Observations find multiplicity at all stages of stellar evolution. An elevated frequency of multiplicity is found at the early stages of star formation, which shows that most stars are formed in multiple systems. In this talk we look at some of the open questions regarding formation and structure of multiple stars, namely the formation of rotationally supported disks, chemical structure of early stage star formation, and the factors that influence star formation. Multi-wavelength observations are coupled with chemical and physical models, to address these questions. We demonstrate that stellar multiplicity is common and needs to be taken into account in our picture of star formation.
