Dear all,

FYI.  This is an announcement for the ALMA Long Baseline Workshop.


Regards,
Keiichi


--------------------------------------------------
ALMA Long Baseline Workshop (2nd announcement)

          Mielparque Kyoto, October 3-5, 2017
--------------------------------------------------

The Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) is now the most powerful mm/submm interferometer in the world, and it is producing a total of > 500 refereed papers in nearly all fields of astronomy and astrophysics. In particular, the ~0.02” submm images obtained during the long baseline campaign in 2014 (ALMA Partnership et al. 2015) have led to numerous publication and followup observational and theoretical studies, signifying the extreme importance of the high resolution imaging capabilities of ALMA.  

The scope of this three day workshop is to (1) review the high-resolution ALMA science results obtained to date, (2) identify detailed science cases for the future baseline expansion of ALMA (e.g. aiming at an angular resolution of ~ 0.001”-0.003"), (3) discuss the scientific and technical requirements such as, for example, angular resolution, number and size of the antennas, sensitivity and operational frequency, and (4) review the technical feasibility studies for longer baseline imaging. We envision the output of this workshop to be used as a guideline to pave the pathway for the future expansion of ALMA.

We will have slots available for contributed talks. We will also have space for poster presentations.

Registration is now available from the following website.

IMPORTANT NOTE: 
The workshop can accommodate up to ~100 participants, and registration will be processed on first-come-first-served basis.  Registration will be closed when we reach the maximum number of participants.  Please register early.
