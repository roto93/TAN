Speaker:    Lapo Fanciullo (ASIAA)
Topic:         Determining the Systematic Errors in Fits of Dust Thermal Emission: The Role of Laboratory Data in Upcoming Models
Time:         6/19 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:         R1203


*** Special Seminar ***
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Yapeng Zhang (CUHK)
Topic:         Magnetic field orientations and star formation rates
Time:         6/19 (Monday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
The relation between star formation rates (SFRs) and  magnetic field
is still a mystery. Through a comparison  between the surveys of SFRs
and a study of cloud–field alignment—which revealed a bimodal (parallel 
or perpendicular) alignment—we show that the perpendicular alignment 
tends to have lower SFRs per solar mass. This indicates that B-fields are 
a primary regulator of SFRs: a perpendicular cloud-field alignment has 
higher magnetic flux than parallel cases and the support of the gas 
against self- gravity is stronger. Moreover, cloud fragmentation and magnetic field alignment is found to be selfsimilar (e.g. Li et al. 2015). Whether the bimodal SFR is also 
selfsimilar can only be answered with a higher resolution of magnetic-
field detection. I will also introduce APol, the ASTE Polarimeter, which I 
am leading to build for this purpose.
