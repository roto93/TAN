*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Hung-Hsu Chan (NTU)
Topic:         How do stars affect wave-dark matter?
Time:         9/13 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
Wave dark matter (ψDM) consisting of a non-relativistic Bose-Einstein condensate, is considered to be a viable dark matter candidate. Due to the uncertainty principle that counters gravity below a Jeans scale, the small-scale structures are suppressed and a solitonic core persists in galaxy formation and evolution. We, for the first time, conduct ψDM simulations including stars. Nontrivial interactions between ψDM and stars are to be presented. ψDM lenses also show different strong lensing features from CDM lenses. The granularity in ψDM halos engenders anomalous fluxes of lensed images, and solitonic cores yield a distinct transition in the small-scale Einstein radius distribution.
