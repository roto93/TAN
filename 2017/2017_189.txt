Dear Patrick,

How are you?  ?I¡¦m writing to ask your help in spreading the word that I have a postdoctoral position available in my group.  The successful candidate will lead the development of parallel processing algorithms to be applied to data from the upcoming Antarctic flight of the recently upgraded BLAST-TNG experiment, and will have access to both our local supercomputer (>10,000 cores) and the expertise of computing specialists associated with our growing research center, CIERA.  Also, depending on interest, there are good opportunities for instrument development work for TolTEC, a new polarimetric camera? for the Large Millimeter Telescope, as well as for leading science investigations with BLAST-TNG, TolTEC, and/or the SOFIA polarimeter HAWC+.  For HAWC+, my group has access to a large data set of instrument team Guaranteed Time Observations.  Links to the advertisement and to my group¡¦s web page appear below.  Please let me know if you have any ideas or questions and note th!
at the deadline for applications is not very firm.  


Best,
Giles

*****************************************

November 3, 2017

Dear our colleagues, key members of APCosPA Org:

    "The Universe" have been there for almost five years - as a
journal/newsletter for the 21st Century. We have always in mind that the
journal was created for the new century, the 21st Century. Enclosed please
find the current list from the Inspire, the largest particle physics
information system.

    We have created, for the authors of the papers in "The Universe", the
T.D. Lee Prize(s) of "The Universe", giving out once every three years.
The prize carries US3,600$ plus round-trip travel to Taipei. The first
T.D. Lee prizes of "The Universe" were given, in 2016, to Tong-Mow Yan
(Cornell) for his paper on "Drell-Yan Processes" and to Bruce McKellar
(Melbourne) for his paper on the HMW phase. An anonymous distinguished
committee was responsible for the choices. We should encourage the birth
of the brand new idea - in physics or in mathematics.

    Meanwhile, we tighten our criterion for the refereeing system -
an increase from two to three referees, picked by the core editors. All
these are applied to "The Universe" (having nothing to do the following
proposals). Basically, there are too many journals; we don't want to be
one of them.

    As of November 3, 2017, we would like to announce our intention for
the next step, the proposal to create a few "The Universe" series:

    The Universe A: Mathematics

    The Universe B: Physics

    The Universe C: Chemistry

    The Universe D: Refereed Conference Proceedings 

    We all know that Einstein's relativity principle and the quantum
principle, the two fundamendal physics principle, are here to dictate our
Universe or our World - so, in the 21st Century we should focus our
attention to understand the Universe. That is why we create "The Universe"
to begin with and propose the series for the purpose.

    Like Physical Review Series, there is an ampere room for the Universe
for the 21st Century - in fact, these days the name "physics" seems to be
too big and too wide. A precise name would lead to further progresses in
the said field(s).

    As the potential Editor-in-Chief for "The Universe A: Mathematics",
we suggest Y.T. Yau, the famous mathematician at Harvard,

    On the Editor-in-Chief for "The Universe B: Physics", we suggest the
director of T.D. Lee Center since we are giving out the T.D. Lee prizes
of "The Universe" once every three years.

    The beginning of each journal would be flexible, as the whole 21st
Century should give us a long-time span. The idea is that "The Universe A:
Mathematics" or "The Universe B: Physics" is a very good name (compared
with Physical Review, Modern physics, etc.), for the journal of the 21st
Century. As "century" intellectuals, we try to upgrade the level of the
basic knowledge, since Eistein's relativity principle and the quantum
principle should be here to dictate our World, the Universe.

                                Sincerely yours, W-Y. Pauchy Hwang
                                                  Editor-in-Chief
                                                  The Universe

____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Keiichi Asada (ASIAA)
Topic:         Mass accretion flow onto SMBH probed with mm polarimetric observations
Time:         11/20 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:         R1203


*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Bernhard Brandl (Leiden University)
Topic:         Science and Technology of the Mid-Infrared Imager and Spectrograph (METIS) at ESO's Extremely Large Telescope (ELT)
Time:         11/21 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
With a collecting area of 39m in diameter, the European Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) will be the largest telescope optical/IR for many years to come.  The work on telescope and instruments is in full steam, leading to expected first light in 2024.  The ELT will be equipped with three scientific instruments, one of them being the Mid-Infrared Imager and Spectrograph (METIS). In this talk I present an overview of the ELT project, explain the design and science goals of METIS, and discuss some of the challenges to instruments on the next generation of extremely large telescopes.


*** Special Seminar ***
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Kate Su (University of Arizona)
Topic:         Baby Photos of a Scaled-Up Solar System - HD 95086
Time:         11/22 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
Planets and minor bodies such as asteroids, Kuiper-belt objects and comets are integral components of a planetary system. Interactions among them leave clues about the formation process of a planetary system. The signature of such interactions is most prominent through observations of its debris disk at millimeter wavelengths where emission is dominated by the population of large grains that stay close to their parent bodies. I will discuss our ALMA 1.3 mm observation of HD 95086, a young early-type star that hosts a directly imaged giant planet b and a massive debris disk with both asteroid- and Kuiper-belt analogs. The high angular resolution and sensitivity provided by ALMA enable us to resolve the Kuiper-belt analog for the first time. Based on the disk properties, HD 95086 is truly a young analog of HR 8799, suggesting a common path on how planetary systems form and evolve.
