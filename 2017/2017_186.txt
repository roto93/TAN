Dear Patrick,

How are you?  ?I¡¦m writing to ask your help in spreading the word that I have a postdoctoral position available in my group.  The successful candidate will lead the development of parallel processing algorithms to be applied to data from the upcoming Antarctic flight of the recently upgraded BLAST-TNG experiment, and will have access to both our local supercomputer (>10,000 cores) and the expertise of computing specialists associated with our growing research center, CIERA.  Also, depending on interest, there are good opportunities for instrument development work for TolTEC, a new polarimetric camera? for the Large Millimeter Telescope, as well as for leading science investigations with BLAST-TNG, TolTEC, and/or the SOFIA polarimeter HAWC+.  For HAWC+, my group has access to a large data set of instrument team Guaranteed Time Observations.  Links to the advertisement and to my group¡¦s web page appear below.  Please let me know if you have any ideas or questions and note th!
at the deadline for applications is not very firm.  


Best,
Giles
