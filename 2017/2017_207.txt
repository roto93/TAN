Dear all,

    The ALMA Cycle 6 Pre-announcement has been released. 

    The Joint ALMA Observatory (JAO) will start the next cycle of observing (Cycle 6) in October 2018. 
    A Call for Proposals with detailed information on Cycle 6 will be issued in March 2018, with a deadline for proposal submission in April 2018. 
    This pre-announcement highlights aspects of the Cycle 6 proposal call that are needed to plan proposals.

    The key dates for Cycle 6 are given below.

        18 December 2017    Cycle 6 pre-announcement

        1 February 2018    Additional information on configuration schedule

        20 March 2018        Release of the ALMA Cycle 6 Call for Proposals and Observing Tool, and opening of archive for proposal submission

        19 April 2018        Proposal deadline

        18-23 June 2018    Proposal Review meeting

        End of July 2018    Result of the proposal review sent to Proposers

        6 September 2018    Deadline for Phase 2 submission by Proposers

        October 2018        Start of ALMA Cycle 6 observations

        September 2019    End of Cycle 6 observations

    New in Cycle 6 â€” In Cycle 6, the following opportunities will be available to Proposers for the first time.

        a. Circular polarization: proposals will be accepted for Bands 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 in all (including circular) polarization modes for continuum and spectral-line observations. The minimum detectable degree of circular polarization, defined as three times the systematic calibration uncertainty, is currently 1.8% of the peak flux for both TDM and FDM observations. Additional information on the circular polarization capabilities will be presented in the 1 February 2018 announcement on the ALMA Science Portal.

        b. Band 6 IF extension: The Band 6 IF bandwidth has been increased by 0.5 GHz to extend from 4.5 to 10 GHz. This will enable 12CO, 13CO, and C18O J=2-1 to be observed simultaneously with broader spectral windows for galactic sources and nearby galaxies.

        c. Band 8 ACA Standalone: Band 8 can be requested on the ACA in standalone mode.

        d. Band 8 standard mode: Band 8 will become a standard mode starting in Cycle 6.

*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Yi-Kuan Chiang (JHU)
Topic:         Which Galactic dust map should I use? Insights from extragalactic tomography
Time:         12/27 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
Over the past few years, clustering-based redshift estimation has emerged as a new way to estimate redshifts and perform extragalactic tomography of arbitrary datasets. On a similar timescale, observations by Planck, WISE, Pan-STARRS and 21cm radio surveys have been used to create a multitude of SFD-type Galactic dust maps. I will explain how clustering-based redshift estimation can be used to test the quality of the seven different dust maps currently available and I will show that extragalactic signatures can be revealed in many of them. When such maps are used for correcting optical magnitudes, we therefore expect biases which are likely to affect the precision of cosmological experiments using supernovae, BAOs, or the growth of structures. I will present possible solutions to alleviate this issue and discuss which map should be used depending on which measurement one wishes to make.

Dear all,

We will have a special TTTT seminar on 26 Dec. in NTHU, given by Dr. 
Seong Jin Kim,
who is  a new postdoc in Prof. Tomo's group in NTHU.

Title:
Properties of 250 um-selected dusty star-forming (SF) galaxies in the 
North Ecliptic Pole (NEP) field

Speaker: Dr. Seong Jin Kim

Time: 12:20pm 26th Dec. 2017 (Tuesday)

Venue: R501, IoA, 5th floor in the 2nd General Building in NTHU

Abstract:
To introduce my current work, I would like to give a presentation about 
the star-forming (SF) galaxies
selected by 250 um band detection of the Herschel/SPIRE survey on the 
entire North Ecliptic Pole (NEP)
field of AKARI.  By matching these SPIRE sources with the optical 
spectroscopic survey data, around 300
SF galaxies were selected. We carried out spectral energy distribution 
(SED) fit using multi-wavelength
photometric data for the sample. The physical properties derived in this 
work will be presented and discussed.

With best regards,
Tetsuya

Dear Yi-Jehng,

The SMA call forLarge-scale and Standard proposals (2018A semester) has been announced.
I would appreciate it if you could circulate it to TAN.

Regards,
Naomi

--------------------------------------------


Dear Colleague,

We wish to draw your attention to the Large Scale Projects program for observations with the Sub-millimeter Array (SMA), which is now accepting proposals. Under this program, proposals dedicated to answering major astrophysical questions having significant scientific impact requiring observing times of order 100-1000 hours are solicited.  In this communication, we are also pre-announcing the dates for standard observing proposals. These calls are for the 2018A semester with observing period May 16, 2018 - Nov 15, 2018.

The SMA is a reconfigurable interferometric array of eight 6-m antennas on Mauna Kea jointly built and operated by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory and the Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics. The array operates in the 230, 345 and 400 GHz bands. 

The SMA has recently completed significant upgrades in observational capability, with more under way. Currently, the SMA observes simultaneously with two orthogonally polarized receivers, one in the 230 GHz or 345 GHz band and the other in the 240 GHz or 400 GHz band (with full polarimetric observations available using the 230+240 or 345+400 band combinations). The SWARM correlator processes 8 GHz bandwidth for each receiver in each sideband, for a total of 32 GHz, at a uniform 140 kHz resolution. This 32 GHz frequency coverage can be continuous where the tuning ranges overlap for the two orthogonally polarized receivers. In short, the SMA now provides flexible, wide band frequency coverage that delivers high continuum sensitivity and excellent spectral line capabilities. A full track offers continuum sensitivity of 200 or 500 micro-Jy (1 sigma) at 230 or 345 GHz in good weather conditions (precipitable water vapor 2.5mm and 1.0mm, respectively). The corresponding line sensi!
tivities at 1 km/s resolution are 30 and 70 mJy. The small antennas allow access to low spatial frequencies in the sub-compact configuration, and at the other extreme, the finest angular resolution with the very extended configuration at 345 GHz is ~ 0.25". The compact and extended configurations bridge the range. Thus, in some ways, the characteristics and performance of the SMA are both similar and complementary to those of the stand-alone Atacama Compact Array (ACA) component of ALMA. 

The Large Scale Projects program follows a phased development, submission and review path, with the final selection of successful proposals synchronized with the TAC process for regular proposals. Accordingly, a Notice of Intent is required ahead of full submission. The deadlines are:

Large Scale Projects proposals

Notice of Intent: 15 January, 2018 
Full submission: 20 February, 2018 

Standard Observing Proposals

Submissions open  : 15 January 2018 (expected date)
Submissions Close : 08 March 2018

A second announcement will be circulated when the standard proposal system opens for submissions.
