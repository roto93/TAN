Dear All,

Please note that the registration deadline for the March EA ALMA Science Workshop is 
Jan 15, 2017, about 2 weeks from now, for people who would like to give talks.

Please remember to register in the meeting website before the deadline:
http://events.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/workshop/20170310/

Note that you are strongly encouraged to present your idea/work if you plan to submit
an ALMA proposal in 2017 and if you are looking for collaborators.  People working 
on other wavebands/theories who are interested in ALMA observations are also strongly
encouraged to give talks.  Unlike previous ALMA EA workshops, this one emphasizes on
forming future collaborations.  We also have several excellent speakers coming from 
outside the EA region to present review talks.  See the front page of the website for
more details.

Also, for the first time, we will feature a review talk on ALMA¡¦s solar capability.

Don¡¦t miss this opportunity to broaden or to start your ALMA work.



Cheers,
Wei-Hao
