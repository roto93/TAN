Abstract:
The well-established scaling relationships for supermassive black holes can be preserved  across cosmic time if star formation in these galaxies  is regulated by feedback via mechanical and radiative power from the accreting central supermassive black hole. We have undertaken a multi-wavelength investigation  of about 130 southern AGN at redshifts<0.02, in order to search for signatures of AGN feedback. We have obtained optical integrated field unit datacubes for our sample with the Siding Spring 2.3m telescope, and are doing follow-up  radio imaging with the GMRT and ATCA in addition to the compilation of data at multiple frequencies. Our work in progress on this multi-wavelength investigation will be discussed.
