*** Special Seminar ***

Speaker:    Hua-bai Li (CUHK)
Topic:         Probing Star Formation from Hong Kong
Time:         8/7 (Monday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
I moved to CUHK in Aug. 2013, right after the Protostars & 
Planets VI conference, where we contributed a review chapter about the role of magnetic fields 
(B-fields) in star formation [1]. The chapter concluded that B-field orientation should be quite 
ordered from the cloud to core scales. We are trying to understand the consequence of such 
kind of B-fields on cloud fragmentation [2], star formation rates [3] and turbulence 
behaviors (anisotropy [4] and ambipolar diffusion),  based on both observations and numerical 
simulations. We are also building the polarimeter, a field mapping instrument, for ASTE. I look 
forward to collaboration on these topics, especially from my hometown Taiwan.


*** Colloquium ***

Speaker:    Testuya Hashimoto (NTHU)
Topic:         Surface density: a new parameter in the fundamental metallicity relation of star-forming galaxies
Time:         8/9 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
Star-forming galaxies display a close relation among stellar mass, metallicity and star-formation rate. This is known as the fundamental metallicity relation (FMR), and it has a profound implication on models of galaxy evolution. However, there still remains a significant residual scatter around the FMR. We show here that a fourth parameter, the surface density of stellar mass, reduces the dispersion around the FMR. In a principal component analysis of 29 physical parameters of 41,338 star-forming galaxies, the surface density is found to be the fourth most important parameter. The new four-dimensional fundamental relation forms a tighter hypersurface that reduces the metallicity dispersion to 50% of that of the FMR. We suggest that future analyses and models of galaxy evolution should consider the FMR in a four-dimensional space that includes surface density. The dilution time scale of gas inflow and the star-formation efficiency can explain the observational dependence on !
surface density.
