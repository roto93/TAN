Dear CASA users,

We'd like to get your feedback on your CASA experiences so we can better
improve CASA in an effective way. For instance, just to name a few, do you
have any suggestions or comments on 
1) using CASA for single dish calibrations (e.g. TP array);
2) support of external toolkit (e.g. STATCONT);
3) pipeline weblog browser compatibility;
4) continuum subtraction in pipeline imaging;
5) pipeline polarisation handling;
6) ... ...

Also, have you heard about CASA crash reporter? or CASA cloud computing for
large-scale imaging? How about CARTA? Do you know CASA Viewer maybe soon be
replaced by CARTA?

There are many issues we need to know your opinions and feedback.

Please drop me or Shige a line before September 30 -- to make CASA more user
friendly and more powerful. Appreciate.


Regards,
Yi-Jehng

Dear Yu-Nung,

thank you for sending out the inquiry letter for CASA feedback to everyone.
However, the deadline seems a bit tight.  May we change the deadline to
September 30 (Saturday)?  The CUC meeting will be held in early November
this year.

Cheers,
Yi-Jehng
