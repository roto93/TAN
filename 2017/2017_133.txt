Workshop rationale:
  This is the second circular of "East-Asia AGN Workshop 2017" held on
4th-6th December 2017 in Kagoshima, Japan. This is the fifth meeting of
a series of workshops for fostering various East Asian collaborations
in the AGN/SMBH field. The East-Asia AGN Workshop aims at fostering
close collaborations among AGN/SMBH researchers in East Asian regions.
Research collaborations in East Asia are getting more important recently,
given various opportunities provided by the East Asian Observatory (JCMT,
Subaru, ...) and also on-going and future large international projects
such as ALMA, TMT, and GMT. We believe that this workshop will provide
various opportunity to foster new collaborations for tackling exciting
mysteries in the AGN/SMBH field.
In this fifth workshop, we have a =E2=80=9Cfocused session=E2=80=9D about e=
xtremely
high spatial resolution observations in AGN/SMBH studies. Abstract
submissions for such studies (e.g., outcomes of ETH, KaVA, and ALMA,
but not restricted in those facilities) are especially encouraged. We
will invite some invited speakers, that will be announced later.

Registration:
  Now the registration webform is open. The deadline for the registration
and the abstract submission is the 12th September. Due to the limited
time of the workshop, some of applicants for oral talks may be requested
to switch to the poster presentation. The registration fee (10,000 JPY)
must be paid at the registration desk in Japanese Yen, only in cash.
Sorry but we cannot accept credit cards and checks.
