Dear all,

This is a reminder of "TTTT seminar" in NTHU.
We start to have periodic guest talks in the astro-ph class
in National Tsing Hua University (NTHU) namely
Timely Talk per Thirty days organized by Tetsuya (TTTT).
Any students and faculties are welcome to join.
The first speaker is as follows.

Title:
An extremely luminous dust-obscured galaxy discovered
by the optical to millimeter observations

Speaker: Yoshiki Toba
Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Academia Sinica

Time: 12:20pm 14th Dec. 2017 (Thursday)
Venue: R501, IoA, 5th floor in the 2nd General Building

Abstract:
I will report the discovery of an extremely-luminous dust-obscured
galaxy (DOG) at z = 3.70. This DOG is selected as a candidate of
extremely-luminous infrared (IR) galaxies based on the photometry
from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and Wide-field Infrared
Survey Explorer (WISE). In order to derive its accurate IR luminosity,
we perform follow-up observations at 450 and 850 micron using the
Submillimetre Common User Bolometer Array 2 (SCUBA-2) on the
James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT), and at 870 and 1300 micron
using the Submillimeter Array (SMA), which enable us to pin down its
IR Spectral Energy Distribution (SED). We perform SED fitting using
14 photometric data (0.4 - 1300 micron) and estimate its IR luminosity,
L_IR (8-1000 micron), to be {1.8 ± 0.2) × 10^14 L_sun, making it one
of the most luminous IR galaxies in the Universe. I will present our
follow-up observations and the SED modeling in detail
(Toba et al. 2017, ApJ, submitted).

With best regards,
Tetsuya
