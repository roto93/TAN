Dear All,
  We will have a very special TIARA seminar this Friday 28 at 2pm.

  Frank H. Shu (ASIAA, and Astron Solutions Corporation) will give a talk with the title
"Six Decades of Spiral Density Wave Theory"

  The topic is particularly relevant to galaxy structure and protoplanetary disks, and the speaker is particularly relevant to scientific efforts at ASIAA.
  We appreciate the organizers of 5th IAA Interstellar and Circumstellar Medium workshop for their help in arranging the schedule of this special seminar.
  Welcome all to hear this interesting talk,
Ruben

Title: Six Decades of Spiral Density Wave Theory
Time: July 28, Friday, 14:00 - 15:00
Place: 1F Auditorium
Abstract:
The theory of spiral density waves had its origin approximately six decades ago in an attempt to reconcile the winding dilemma of material spiral arms in flattened disk galaxies. Our review of this subject begins with the earliest calculations of linear and nonlinear spiral density waves in disk galaxies, in which the hypothesis of quasi-stationary spiral structure (QSSS) plays a central role. The earliest success was the prediction of the nonlinear compression of the interstellar medium and its embedded magnetic field; the earliest failure, seemingly, was not detecting color gradients associated with the migration of OB stars whose formation is triggered downstream from the spiral shock front.  The reasons for this apparent failure are understood with an update on the current status of the problem of OB star formation, including its relationship to the feathering substructure of galactic spiral arms.  Infrared images can show two-armed, grand design spirals, even when the o!
ptical and UV images show flocculent structures. We suggest how the nonlinear response of the interstellar gas, coupled with overlapping subharmonic resonances, might introduce chaotic behavior in the dynamics of the interstellar medium and Population I objects, even though the underlying forces to which they are subject are regular. We then move to a discussion of resonantly forced spiral density waves in a planetary ring and their relationship to the ideas of disk truncation, and the shepherding of narrow rings by satellites orbiting nearby. The back reaction of the rings on the satellites led to the prediction of planet migration in protoplanetary disks, which has had widespread application in the exploding data sets concerning hot Jupiters and extrasolar planetary systems.  We then return to the issue of global normal modes in the stellar disk of spiral galaxies and its relationship to the QSSS hypothesis, where the central theoretical concepts involve waves with negati!
ve and positive surface densities of energy and angular moment!
um in th
e regions interior and exterior, respectively, to the corotation circle; the consequent transmission and overreflection of propagating spiral density waves incident on the corotation circle; and the role of feedback from the central regions.  Lastly, we discuss how the amplitude modulation predicted for the destructive interference of oppositely propagating waves that form standing wave patterns may have been observed in deep infrared images of nearby spiral galaxies.
