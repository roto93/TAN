Dear All,

LIGOâ€™s first detection of the Gravitational Waves (GW) 
opened a new era of GW astronomy and physics.

We will have the 3rd KAGRA International Workshop (KIW3) 
at ASIAA (NTU campus) on May/21, 22.
KAGRA is an Asian based GW project led by 2015 Nobel laureate, T.Kajita. 

This workshop is open to and welcomes everyone who has interests.

The detailed information and program are available at:
http://grqc.ncts.ncku.edu.tw/KAGRA2017/index.html

Particularly, on the second day (May/22) we will invite distinguished speakers 
on the GW projects such as LIGO, Virgo, KAGRA as well as eLISA PF and other space-based projects.

The talk by Gabriela Gonzalez (Former LIGO Spokesperson):
"Searching for - and finding! gravitational waves"
will be held as ASIAA-NTU special joint Colloquium.

It would be great if many from our community can join the workshop and discussions.
For those who are interested, please make a registration at:

On the next day (May/23) there will be another workshop 
Second ASTROD International Workshop (AIW2) at Hsinchu to discuss on the GW detection in space.
