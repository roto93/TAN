Topic:          Emission from the direct vicinity of black holes
Time:           2/20 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
In a black hole magnetosphere, when the plasma accretion rate is much
lower than the Eddington limit, a strong electric field inevitably
appears along the magnetic field lines due to charge deficit.  In
such a charge-starved region (or a gap), the electric field accelerates
migratory electrons and positrons into ultra relativistic energies.
These relativistic leptons emit copious gamma-rays via curvature and
inverse-Compton (IC) processes. Some of such gamma-rays collide with
the submillimeter-IR photons emitted from the radiatively inefficient
accretion flow (RIAF) to materialize as pairs.  The created pairs
polarize to partially screen the original acceleration electric field.
By solving this pair-creation cascade self-consistently for the first
time, we find that the gap emissions from the direct vicinity of
stellar-mass, intermediate-mass, and super-massive black holes are
detectable with Fermi/LAT and Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes
(e.g., MAGIC, HESS, VERITAS, and CTA) when the accretion rate is
in a certain range.  Moreover, such HE/VHE gamma-ray fluxes are predicted
to exhibit anti-correlation with the RIAF submillimeter fluxes,
which enables us to discriminate the gap emission from the standard,
shock-in-jet model, e.g., by using ALMA and CTA.

Topic:          Cosmology from Gravitational Lens Time Delays
Time:           2/21 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
Strong gravitational lens systems with time delays between the
multiple images are a powerful probe of cosmology and astrophysics. In
particular, the time-delay distance from such a system is primarily
sensitive to the Hubble constant (H0) that is key to probing dark
energy, neutrino physics, and the spatial curvature of the Universe,
as well as discovering new physics.  The H0 Lenses In COSMOGRAILâ€™s
Wellspring (H0LiCOW) project aims to measure H0 to <3.5% precision
from five lensed quasars using deep Hubble Space Telescope imaging,
precise time delay measurements from the COSMOGRAIL monitoring
project, a measurement of the velocity dispersion of the lens
galaxies, and a characterization of the mass distribution along the
line of sight.  The most recent H0LiCOW analysis of the system HE
0435-1223 is able to constrain the time-delay distance to a precision
of ~8%.  In combination with the previous two H0LiCOW lenses, we
constrain H0 to ~3.8% precision for a flat Lambda CDM cosmology,
independent of and competitive with the latest distance ladder
results.  The results are consistent with independent determinations
of H0 using the distance ladder method and are in moderate tension
with the latest Planck results for a similar cosmology, hinting at
possible new physics beyond the standard LCDM model and highlighting
the importance of this independent probe.

Topic:          Millimetre/Submillimetre Astronomy Studies of Evolved Stars, Protostars and High Redshift Galaxies
Time:           2/22 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:           R1203
Abstract:
The observation of molecular emission at millimetre and submillimetre wavelengths gives access to the study of stars having a large and cool circumstellar envelope as well as of the gas reservoirs of galaxies, in particular remote galaxies with redshift in the 2 to 5 range at the epoch of maximum star formation rate. The observation of the continuum emission underneath the molecular excitation lines provides important information on the dust content. Using Plateau de Bure and archival ALMA observations, we have been able to reconstruct in space, under simplifying hypotheses such as of invariance by rotation about an axis, both the morphology and the kinematics of such sources. Examples will illustrate these studies, including Asymptotic Giant Branch stars, protostars and gravitationally lensed high redshift galaxies.
