Speaker:    Keiichi Asada (ASIAA)
Topic:         Mass accretion flow onto SMBH probed with mm polarimetric observations
Time:         11/20 (Monday) 12:00 - 13:00
Place:         R1203


*** Colloquium ***
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Bernhard Brandl (Leiden University)
Topic:         Science and Technology of the Mid-Infrared Imager and Spectrograph (METIS) at ESO's Extremely Large Telescope (ELT)
Time:         11/21 (Tuesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
With a collecting area of 39m in diameter, the European Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) will be the largest telescope optical/IR for many years to come.  The work on telescope and instruments is in full steam, leading to expected first light in 2024.  The ELT will be equipped with three scientific instruments, one of them being the Mid-Infrared Imager and Spectrograph (METIS). In this talk I present an overview of the ELT project, explain the design and science goals of METIS, and discuss some of the challenges to instruments on the next generation of extremely large telescopes.


*** Special Seminar ***
____________________________________________________ 
Speaker:    Kate Su (University of Arizona)
Topic:         Baby Photos of a Scaled-Up Solar System - HD 95086
Time:         11/22 (Wednesday) 14:20 - 15:20
Place:         R1203
Abstract:
Planets and minor bodies such as asteroids, Kuiper-belt objects and comets are integral components of a planetary system. Interactions among them leave clues about the formation process of a planetary system. The signature of such interactions is most prominent through observations of its debris disk at millimeter wavelengths where emission is dominated by the population of large grains that stay close to their parent bodies. I will discuss our ALMA 1.3 mm observation of HD 95086, a young early-type star that hosts a directly imaged giant planet b and a massive debris disk with both asteroid- and Kuiper-belt analogs. The high angular resolution and sensitivity provided by ALMA enable us to resolve the Kuiper-belt analog for the first time. Based on the disk properties, HD 95086 is truly a young analog of HR 8799, suggesting a common path on how planetary systems form and evolve.
