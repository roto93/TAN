[Subaru Planetary Nebula workshop; Dec 11-13 in Hong Kong]

Dear all, 

We have a meeting aiming to promote planetary nebula
and related science cases using the Subaru Telescope amongst researchers 
in potential partner countries (Taiwan, China, Korea, Australia). 
This meeting is officially supported by NAOJ.

The meeting (Dec 11-13) is hold at the university of Hong Kong immediately 
after asymmetric planetary nebulae IV meeting in Hong Kong.
The tentative program as of 10 Nov is as follows.

11 Dec morning (Day 1)
* Introduction of this workshop: M. Otsuka (ASIAA)
* Introduction of Subaru Telescope: A. Tajitsu (NAOJ/Subaru)
* Overview of planetary nebulae: S. Kwok (HKU)

11 Dec afternoon
* Chemical abundances of planetary nebulae and related objects
- Stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis: A. Karakas (Monash University)
- Elemental abundances of MW PNe: T.-H. Lee (W. Kentucky Univ./ASIAA)
- Elemental abundances of PNe in M31: X. Fang (HKU)

* Chemical evolution of galaxies
- K. Bekki (University of Western Australia)
- T. Tsujimoto (NAOJ)

12 Dec morning (Day 2)
* Dust and molecules in planetary nebulae
- Overview: J. Cami (University of Western Ontario)
- Characteristics of PAHs in PNe: R. Ohsawa (U. of Tokyo)
- Far-IR dust component in PNe by Herschel: K. Asano (U. of Denver)
- Dusty disks around white dwarfs: Y.-H. Chu (ASIAA)

12 Dec afternoon
* Database of planetary nebulae
- Q. A. Parker (HKU)

* Study of PNe and related objects done/doing by using Subaru Telescope
- T. Ueta (U. Denver), A. Tajitsu (NAOJ/Subaru), M. Otsuka (ASIAA)

* Discussion 
- potential research initiatives/collaborations
  using Subaru Telescope

13 Dec morning (Day 3)
* writing observing proposals for S18B

13 Dec afternoon
* writing observing proposals for S18B (cont.)
* future plans and summary

---

We would like to spend a good chunk of time developing actual proposals 
using the current instruments and future delivered instruments such as PSF, 
and discussing international operation.
