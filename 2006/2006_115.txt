Dear TANet administrator,

We should appreciate it very much if you could kindly upload
our workshop program again on TANet, because the schedule was
changed in this semi-final version.  I am herewith attaching

Dear TANet members,

We are going to hold a small workshop entitled "High Energy Phenomena 
around Compact Objects".  

       NOTICE: SCHEDULE CHANGED (no talks on July 7, Friday)

The purpose of this workshop is to discuss observational and theoretical
progress of high-energy phenomena like jet, accretion, and particle 
acceleration around black holes and neutron stars, and to share a common 
interest in this field with scientist in Taiwan and different countries.

Dear Interferometry School Students:

This is the 2nd and last circular before the school starts on July 10.
We hope that you are getting ready to attend the school.
In this circular, we would like to make sure a couple of things.
The web site of the Interferometry School has been updated,
and have many useful information. Please take a look at
http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/act/int_school/2006/.

1. Lecture room: Lectures and labs will be held in the Physics  
Department
Building of the National Taiwan University (NTU). Lecture and lab rooms
are R833 (8F) and R916 (9F). A map of the NTU campus is available
at the school web site.

2.  Program: The final program is now available at the school
web site. In addition, you can find contents/abstracts/assignments
of some of lectures at the web site. All the students are strongly
encouraged to check contents/abstracts/assignments before
each lecture.

3. Registration: The registration will be started at R833 in the Physics
Department Building (8F) at 8:30 am on July 10.  You will receive
a school kit at the registration.

4. Lunch Box: A lunch box will be provided everyday. A sing-up sheet
for the lunch box will be prepared, and you have to sign-up everyday
to have a lunch box. You can eat your lunch at the lecture room,
but please clean up after you finish lunch.

5. Reception: A reception will be held at 5:00 pm on July 11 after  
the school.
All the students are very welcome to the reception. More details will be
announced at the registration.

6. Accommodation: Some of you will have an accommodation at the Activity
Center of Academia Sinica. Information on the accommodation has been
sent out separately. If you have not received it even though you need
an accommodation, please send email to int_school@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw.

7. Shuttle Bus: Students staying at the Activity Center of Academia  
Sinica
can take a shuttle bus commuting between Academia Sinica and NTU.
The shuttle bus is free. The details about the Shuttle Bus is available
at the school web site.

See you soon!

on the behalf of the school organizers
