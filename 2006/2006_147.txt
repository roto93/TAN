Announcement of Opportunity (AO-2) of Suzaku

1. Overview
The Japanese-US X-ray Astronomy satellite Suzaku was
launched by ISAS/JAXA on 2005 July 10, and has since
successfully carried out astronomical observations using the
4 X-ray CCD cameras (XISs) and Hard X-ray Detctor (HXD),
although the X-Ray Spectrometer (XRS) is no longer
operational. Between 2005 September and 2006 March ("SWG
phase" - see below), observations were carried out for
instrument calibration and performance verification, which
confirm the wide-bandpass, high-sensitivity, moderate
spectral resolution capabilities of Suzaku. In 2006 April,
we entered the 1-year international AO-1 phase of the
mission, performing observations based on proposals received
from the astronomical community world-wide. We plan to start
AO-2 observations in 2007 April, and hereby invite
submission of observing proposals as follows.
US based scientists should consult the parallel announcement
at
http://astroe.gsfc.nasa.gov/
while scientists in ESA member countries should consult the
version at
http://www.rssd.esa.int/Suzaku
Present version is applicable to scientists based in all
other countries.

2. Suzaku observatory
The Suzaku satellite carries four X-Ray Telescopes (XRTs)
that focus X-rays up to 12 keV with a high efficiency, each
with an XIS unit at its focus. The XIS has a high
sensitivity particularly for extended sources, as well as
good spectral resolution, for soft X-rays below 0.8 keV, a
capability that is superior to those of Chandra and XMM-
Newton. At the same time, the HXD, though non-imaging, has
unprecedented sensitivity in the wide energy range up to
several hundred keV. The wide bandpass coverage with the XIS
and the HXD is an important characteristic of the Suzaku
mission, so we invite observing proposals that make strong
use of their sensitivities. The details of the instruments
(Technical Description document), and a list of targets that
have been observed or will be observed within the SWG (see
below) time and AO-1 can be found at the
http://www.astro.isas.jaxa.jp/suzaku/
We plan to update the Technical Description document, as
well as planning tools, with latest information in early
October; existing versions should suffice for early planning
of proposals, but may not give accurate results when
detailed simulations are performed.

3. Mission phases and time allocation

The Suzaku mission has been developed as a Japanese-US
collaboration, and the Science Working Group (SWG) that
consist of researchers involved in the development and
operation oversees the project overall. After the end of the
SWG phase of the mission (through 2006 March), normal
observations during AO-1 are entirely through open proposal
process. Similarly, observing time during international AO-2
(1 year period starting 2007 April) is open. This, however,
excludes the following categories.

(1)     Observatory Time (4%) for satellite maintainance and
related purposes
(2)     Calibration time (3%) for routine calibration of
instruments
(3)     Director's Discretionary Time (5%) for any genuinely
unpredictable events including gamma-ray bursts, and other
important observations granted at the discretion of the
mission director.
The remaining 88% of total time is available to proposers.
This will be divided into (1) 50% for Japanese observations;
(2) 37.5% for US observations; and (3) 12.5% for joint
Japanese-US observations. The joint time will be used if
proposals were received for the same target both in Japan
and in the US, and if both PIs accept such merging (the
proposal form will have a check box for the PI to indicate
yes or no). This allocation is based on an ISAS-NASA
agreement. Additionally, within the "Japanese" allocation, 8
% of the observing time is reserved for proposals submitted
to ESA as joint Japan-ESA observations, thus the purely
Japanese time is 42%. The total time available to Japan
researchers is 4923 ks, plus 1465 ks of joint time, assuming
37 ks of good time per day and 360 days of operation per
year. Proposals from non-US, non-ESA countries will be
accepted within the Japanese time up to the ESA portion (938
ks).

4. Observing Constraints
Over 200 objects will have been observed with Suzaku during
the SWG and AO-1 peirods. A full listing can be found on the
web.
http://www.astro.isas.ac.jp/suzaku/accept/
Observations of accepted priority A and B targets are
guranteed, while those of priority C targets and Targets of
Opportunity (TOOs) are not (see below for definitions of
target priorities). Proposals for targets already observed
are allowed, but must include a justification for an
additional observation, such as a much longer exposure,
different pointing within an extended object, or different
observing window of a variable object. Proposers with an
accepted C or TOO targets must re-propose if they wish to
ensure that their observations are carried out (these
targets are in principle open to competition). It must be
noted that if the C target is observed in AO-1 with more
than 70% of proposed time, it will not be observed in AO-2.
If not, it will be observed until total time become 70% of
proposed time of B proposal, while 90% for A proposal. In
these cases, data should be shared by authors of AO-1 and AO
-2.

The length of the observation should be justified based on
the specific scientific objectives, preferably using
simulations. However, we set the minimum observing time at
10 ksec, considering the efficiency of satellite operation.
There is no upper limit to for the observing time, but
longer observations will naturally require stronger
scientific justifications.

It is possible to specify the time of observations (time
critical (TC) observations) to observe specific phases or
for simultaneous observations. The monitoring observations
can be proposed with certain interval. You also able to
chose the roll angle of the optical system. In all these
cases, you have to put on the TC flag in the application
form.

Target of opportunity (TOO) proposals are allowed for short-
lived events on known objects whose timing is uncertain. The
name and coordinates of the object(s) as well as the
triggering conditions must be specified. We also require the
estimated probability during AO-2 of such an event, as well
as its duration. Generic TOOs without a specific target
(such as "a nearby supernova") will not be accepted. The
number of targets listed in a reserved TOO proposal should
not exceed 5.

Any genuinely unpredictable events may be observed outside
the proposal process, as part of the 5% Director's Time.
Data from such observations will not have a proprietary
period. Please make a contact to us for these cases, except
for gamma-ray bursts.
suzaku_managers@astro.isas.jaxa.jp
Gamma-ray burst TOO observations will be planed by the
Suzaku science working group.

5. Review process and schedule
Researchers based in Japan, and non-US, non-ESA countries
should submit proposals to ISAS/JAXA. The deadline is 2006
December 1 at noon JST for proposals. All proposals from
Japan and other countries will be reviewed in the same
process in Japan. After the review in Japan together with
the ESA proposals, a Japan-US merging committee will be
convened in February, and the final observing program will
be published soon thereafter.

Accepted proposal will be classified into three categories.
Priority A targets will be preferentially observed during
the AO-2 period (2007 Apr to 2008 Mar). Priority B targets
will be scheduled in this period as far as possible, but may
be carried over to the following AOs. Priority C targets
will be used as fillers when there are gaps in the schedule.
For the total available time T, we will accept 0.5T, 0.4T,
and 0.5T as As, Bs, and Cs (for a total oversubscription by
40%). If the actual amounts of observatory, calibration, and
director's times add up to less than 12% that is set aside,
then the remainder will be used to observe additional C
targets.

TOOs and time critical observations will be accepted only as
priority A targets.

6. Data right
Observers will have exclusive rights to the data for a 1
year period after receipt of data, after processing. This,
however, does not apply to real time TOO observations and
for Gamma-ray burst data. We will deem an observation
complete if 90% (for A targets) or 70% (for B targets) of
the proposed time is obtained.

(2) General Form (1 page),
(3) Target Forms (1 page),
(4) Target Constraints (1 page),
(5) Target Remarks (1 page),
(6) Scientific Justification (scientific problem and
technical feasibility) (maximum 4 pages; includes text,
figures, charts, and tables),

5.      Supplement Information
For the detail, mission description, especially technical
description is available at the web page
http://www.astro.isas.jaxa.jp/suzaku/
We plan to update the Technical Description document, as
well as planning tools, with latest information in early
October; existing versions should suffice for early planning
of proposals, but may not give accurate results when
detailed simulations are performed.
