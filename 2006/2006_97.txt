Title: WIRCam and beyond: OIR instrumentation plan in IAA
Abstract:
After three years of hard work, WIRCam has be proved to be a powerful
tool for astronomical reserach. Based on the experience of WIRCam, we
are looking froward to the next instrument development project. In
this talk, the possible collaborations will be introduced. They are
the next generation AO system for CFHT and the Hyper SuprimCam for
Subaru telescope. The goal of joining these project is to broaden the
instrumentation capability and also provide the possible access to 8
meter class telescopes. Also, the infrared camera for Lulin telescope
will be briefed in the talk.
