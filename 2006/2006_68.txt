Title: Fast identification of transits from light-curves in TAOS
Abstract:
I will present an algorithm that allows fast and efficient detection
of transits, including planetary transits, from light-curves. The
method is based on building an ensemble of fiducial models and
compressing the data. I will describe the method and demonstrate its
efficiency by finding planet-like transits in simulated TAOS
light-curves. We show that that our method is independent of the size
of the search space of transit parameters.
