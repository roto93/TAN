Dear Yi-Jehng,

Could you please post this on the TAN?  Thanks.

The next Asian-Pacific Reginal IAU Meeting (APRIM) will be held August
1-4, 2008 in Kunming, Yunnan in China.  The web is still being constructed

 http://www.ynao.ac.cn/~aprim/index.htm

but I urge you to consider to take part in this exciting meeting, because
Yunan will have a lot to offer in terms of new observing facilities and
breath-taking sceneraries.  Mark your calendar now.

Wen Ping
