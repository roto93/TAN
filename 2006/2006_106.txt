  Dear all,

        This week, Dr. Jonathan Braine from Observatoire de Bordeaux in
  France and on his way to Ishigaki Island in Japan, will be visting IAA.
  On THURSDAY, Dr. Braine will give a colloquium talk titled, "Star
  Formation and the phases of the ISM in outer disks".

        Please notice the special time of the talk. Mark your calendar and
  remember to join!

  Regards,

  sheng-yuan

  Speaker : Dr. Jonathan Braine (Observatoire de Bordeaux, France)
  Title   : Star Formation and the phases of the ISM in outer disks
  Time    : 06/22 (Thu)  2:00 PM
  Location: Rm 716
  Abstract:
           We present a study of the InterStellar Medium in the outer
            parts of spiral galaxies. The observational part includes
            new observations (detections) of molecular gas far out in
            spiral galaxies, coupled with existing maps of the HI, UV,
            and dust continuum emission. Modeling of the stellar UV-NIR
            emission including absorption by dust grains provides a picture
            of the intrinsic radiation fields. These models are used to
            calculate grain temperatures which are then compared with
            observations of the dust emission. Photo-ionisation codes
            are then used to estimate the properties of the various phases
            of the outer disk ISM. The models and how they compare to
            observations of a variety of spirals from low to normal
            metallicity and luminosity will be the heart of the
            presentation. The smaller objects, like M33, are likely good
            surrogates for intermediate redshift objects which are smaller,
            bluer, and probably slightly less metallic than today's large
            spirals. The goal is to provide reliable estimates of the
            amount of mass in each of the phases (H2, HI, and HII) in
            the outer disks of these galaxies, which can reasonably be
            assumed to be representative. The star formation efficiency
            (star formation rate divided by available gas mass) can then
            be compared over a much broader range of radii than up to now
            in order to understand how galaxies form stars (i.e. the
            gas-stars cycle).
