                               Colloquium
                      at the Institute of Astronomy,
                       National Central University

Date: 10:00, 17/March/2006
Loc.: Room 1013, Science Building IV, National Central University
Speaker: Bacham E. Reddy (Indian Institute of Astrophysics, India)
Title: High metallicity of the stars with Planets: Do stars swallow
       planets? ...Few spectroscopic tests...
Abstract:
Discovery of the planets around stars other than our own Sun can be
billed as one of the important scientific advances in the last
decade. Now there are around 120 stars hosting planets. The
photospheric abundances in the host stars suggest they are more
metal-rich compared to their counter parts in the field. This led to
two competing postulations: they are metal-rich because planetary
material devoid of Hydrogen accreted onto the host star. They are
metal-rich because they formed from metal-rich cloud. In this talk I
will discuss ways of testing the former using spectroscopic
observations.

Date: 14:00, 17/March/2006
Loc.: Room 1013, Science Building IV, National Central University
Speaker: Prof. Su Han-Tzhong (NCKU, Taiwan)
Title: Transient luminous phenomena above thunderstorm systems
Abstract:
Transient luminous events/phenomena (TLEs) in the region between
thunderclouds and the ionosphere are now known to include lighting
induced sprites, elves and halos, as well as upwardly discharging blue
jets and gigantic jets. They are actively studied since the initial
documentation of sprites in 1989. The standard model of Earth's global
electric circuit includes thunderstorms, the conducting ionosphere,
the downward fair-weather currents and the conducting
Earth. Thunderstorms serve as one of the generators that drive current
upward from cloud-tops to the ionosphere, where the electric potential
is hundreds of kilovolts higher than Earth's surface. With the
discovery of upper atmospheric luminous discharges, the roles of these
phenomena in the global are awaiting to be clarified and properly
accounted. Also the effects of TLEs on the energy budget and chemistry
of upper atmosphere are also hanging issues.
In the talk, the results from ground and spacecraft observations of
TLEs in Taiwan will be presented; including the basic characteristics
of TLEs, major hot TLE zones of Earth, the spectroscopic
characteristics of TLEs, the electric characteristics of TLEs, the
meteorological conditions for the occurrence of TLEs, etc.

Note: This talk will be presented in Chinese with the viewgraphs in
English.

Title: Chemodynamics of the Galactic Disk: Clues to its evolution
Abstract:
Main sequence stars of F-, G-, and K-dwarfs are as old as our
Galaxy. The kinematic and abundance study of these stars provide vital
clues to formation and chemical evolution of the Galaxy.  We undertook
a comprehensive study of the Galactic disk by chemically tagging
around 400 stars belonging to various parts of the disk.  I will
discuss the methodology in sample selection, and the results obtained
in the two parts of our study (Reddy et al. 2003, Reddy et al.  2006).
