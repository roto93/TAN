Second Circular

Asian Radio Astronomy Winter School
January 22-26, 2007
National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ), Mitaka, Tokyo, Japan


Registration:
We would like to open the registration for the Asian Radio Astronomy
Winter School. Please visit the on-line registration page on our web
site (http://vsop.mtk.nao.ac.jp/RAWS2007/), and fill out all items in
the registration form.
========================================================================
   The deadline for registration *with financial support* is October 6,
   2006. The final deadline for registration is November 3, 2006.
========================================================================
There will be a registration fee of about 10,000 Japanese Yen (JPY),
which includes a paper copy of the textbook, inspection of the Nobeyama
Radio Observatory, banquet, coffee/tea, and other miscellaneous items.
It should be paid at the registration desk only in cash (JPY).

The Winter School is especially aimed towards young scientists and
graduate students, who are interested in radio astronomy, but more
advanced researchers in this field or others are also welcome. The
maximum number of acceptable participants will be limited to 100 people
because of the capacity of the lecture room. We will select the
attendees after the registration is closed, and the results will be
informed immediately after the selection.
========================================================================
   Please note that, due to limited capacity (100 people), your
   participation is not guaranteed until the LOC informs you of the
   results of the selection, even if your registration is received on
   time.
========================================================================


Accommodation:
We have block bookings during January 21-27 at the observatory dormitory
"Cosmos-Kaikan" located at the NAOJ Mitaka campus. Due to limited
capacities, the number of available rooms is only thirteen (ten singles,
two twins, and one triple).  Should the number of requests exceed the
capacities, priority will be given to students from overseas.
The LOC will arrange other hotel accommodations near the Mitaka campus.
Please select the preferred type of accommodation in the on-line
registration form. If you wish to share a room, we will try to pair you
up with other attendee(s). If so, please advise the LOC via email before
October 6. The results of arrangements will be informed after the
registration is closed.


Financial support:
We can offer some financial support to encourage student participation
in the Winter School. The support will be provided in the form of a
partial reimbursement of the transportation and/or accommodation
expenses. If you need financial support, the on-line registration must
be made by October 6, 2006. Later, by mid-October, applicants who have
requested financial support will be informed of the details of the
support. All the applicants are expected to have some financial support
within the available funding. Please note that the support will not be
guaranteed for applicants who registered after October 6.


Visa:
Some of the attendees from outside Japan are required to have
a visa issued from the Japanese embassy. Please see
"A Guide to Japanese Visas" in detail.
(http://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/index.html)
If you need a visa, please contact the LOC via e-mail. We will issue
an invitation letter for your request.

The preliminary program is given in the following table.
The final version of the program will be described in the third circular
