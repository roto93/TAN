Title: Annihilation Emission from the Galactic Black Hole
Abstract:
Both diffuse high energy gamma-rays and an extended electron-positron
annihilation line emission have been observed in the Galactic Center
(GC) region. Although X-ray observations indicate that the galactic
black hole Sgr A is inactive now, we suggest that the Sgr A was in
active phase long time ago. Consequently a galactic nuclear is
activated when a captured star is tidally disrupted and matter is
accreted into the black hole.  We argue that the galactic black hole
could be a powerful source of relativistic protons when it captures a
star. In this paper we assume that relativistic protons are injected
into the ambient material from the galactic black hole.  We are able
to explain the current observed diffuse gamma-rays and the very
detailed annihilation line spectrum by p-p collisions of these
protons. The required injected amount of energy is consistent with the
estimation of the tidal capture of a massive star with the mass about
10 solar masses. The capture of the lower mass star may be able to
account for the recent TeV observations within 10 pc of the galactic
center. Secondary electrons produced by p-p collisions at energies >
30 MeV are cooled down to thermal energies by Coulomb collisions and
annihilate in the warm neutral and ionized phases of the interstellar
medium with temperatures about several eV because the annihilation
cross-section reaches its maximum at these temperatures. The positrons
are cooled down to thermal temperatures for the time of 410^14 s and
therefore are unseen at first phases after eruption.  They fill by
diffusion an extended region around the Galactic center and being
cooled down emit annihilation emission observed as a very expended
source.
