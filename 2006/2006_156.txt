Dear Yi-Jehng,

please post the upcoming NTNUES colloquium (26/Sep, Tuesday) on TAN.  Our
colloquium talks are usually given at a level for audience with general
earth science background.

thanks,

Lin-wen

TITLE: The Formation and Evolution of Compact Binary Systems

SPEAKER: Prof. Ronald Taam (Northwestern University/TIARA)

ABSTRACT:

In recent years there has been a resurgence of interest
in close binary systems with compact objects.  This has been due,
in part, to the recent observations obtained with the Chandra X-ray
satellite of X-ray point sources within our Galaxy and in external
galaxies. An understanding of these sources depends critically upon
the stellar evolutionary processes responsible for their formation
and evolution. These processes will be described for the formation of
these interacting binaries with white dwarf, neutron star,
and/or black hole components.  The transformation of progenitor
systems from wide orbits to their current tight orbits must have
involved significant mass and angular momentum loss.  A common
envelope phase is generally believed to accomplish this conversion.
The evolutionary links between various classes of compact systems
involving this phase will be eludicated.
