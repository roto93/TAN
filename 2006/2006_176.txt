 Dear all,

        This Friday (11/03), the colloquium talk will be presented
 by Dr. Jun-ichi Nakashima from IAA. Jun-ichi will discuss his latest
 research work with a talk titled "Recent Observational Studies on
 Late-Type Stars with the SMA"

        Please mark your calendar and remember to join the event!

 Regards,

 --------------------------- ASIAA Colloquium ----------------------
  Speaker : Dr. Jun-ichi Nakashima (ASIAA)
  Title   : Recent Observational Studies on Late-Type Stars with the SMA
  Time    : 11/03 (Fri) 2:00 PM
  Location: Rm 716
  Abstract: In this talk I present preliminary results of two different
            ongoing SMA projects on evolved stars: 1) CO mapping of the
            young planetary nebula CRL 618 and 2) a pilot experiment for
            future ALMA observations of galactic center AGB stars. The
            main aim of the first project is to investigate a dense/hot
            region of CRL 618 through mapping in the CO J=6-5 line. We
            have first obtained a map in the CO J=6-5 line, and confirmed
            that the emission region of the CO J=6-5 line is unexpectedly
            large. I discuss the emission regions of the CO J=6-5 line
            and its implication to the evolution of CRL 618. I also discuss
            the intensity variation of the continuum emission. The aim
            of the second project is to confirm whether radio interferometry
            effectively works as a "spatial filter", which picks up the
            non-resolved emission of AGB stars embedded in the extended
            emission of interstellar medium. We observed three IR-bright
            evolved stars toward the galactic center with SMA in the CO
            J=2-1 line, and found that the CO emission of AGB stars can
            be detected but the line profiles do not show a standard
            parabolic profile. I discuss the interpretation of the
            profiles and required future work.
