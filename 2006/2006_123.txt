Lulin One-meter Telescope (LOT) ¡X Call for Observing Proposals for 2006B 
(First Announcement)

Proposal Deadline ¡X August 10th, 2006 ---------------------------------------
-------------------------

The Lulin One-meter Telescope (LOT) solicits observing proposals for the 
semester of 2006B.  In 2006B, due to the overseas coating of the primary 
mirror, we have postponed the starting date to September 1st, 2006.  In 
order not to cause severe impact on the available observing time in the 
semester, we have changed the duration of 2006B so that the semester begins 
on September 1st, 2006 and ends on February 28th, 2007 (9/1/06 ~ 2/28/07), 
making it still a 6-month semester.  As a consequence, the 2007A semester 
will begin on March 1st, 2007 (3/1/07) and will end on August 31st, 2007 
(8/31/07).

Those who are interested in applying for observing time, can download the 
proposal form from the NCU/IA web page:

http://www.lulin.ncu.edu.tw/lot/lot_apply.doc

and submit the proposal to the following email address:

tac_lulin@astro.ncu.edu.tw

by midnight, August 10th, 2006, Taiwan time (UT+8).  The allocation of 
observing time will be announced before August 25th, 2006.  In addition to 
the research proposals, we will also consider educational projects for 
advanced astronomical observation courses.

Instruments Available:

The major observing instrument of LOT is the Lulin CCD Imager (LCI) which 
uses the PI 1300 CCD.  The technical information of LCI can be found in the 
following web page:

http://www.lulin.ncu.edu.tw/lot/1300b.pdf

A second instrument, the Lulin Compact Spectrograph (LCS), is being 
incorporated into the line of instruments this semester in order to bring 
spectroscopic capability to LOT.  One week of bright time (+/- 3 days around 
full moon) every month in 2006B will be reserved for testing and calibration 
of the spectrograph.  Parallel to the commissioning of the spectrograph, 
these reserved slots are also open to the user community for application.  
Users are encouraged to apply for these reserved slots but are advised to 
bear in mind that usage of the spectrograph will be on a shared-risk basis, 
i.e., users should be prepared for compromised performance.  Below please 
find the specifications of LCS:

Lulin Compact Spectrograph (LCS)

Dispersion element: 2 gratings (300 lines/mm and 1200 lines/mm) 
Detector: Apogee AP-8 (SITE chip, 1K¡ÑK)
Length of slit (projection onto the sky with LOT optics): 8.5 arcmin
Width of slit (projection onto the sky with LOT optics): 1.5 arcsec (fixed)
Resolving power: 500 @ 500nm (300 lines/mm) and 2000 @ 500nm (1200 lines/mm) 
Wavelength coverage: 380-760nm, and 500-900nm (300 lines/mm)   
Calibration lamp: Fe-Ar-Ne
