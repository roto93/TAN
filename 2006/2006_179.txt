 Dear all,

        This Friday (11/10), the colloquium talk will be presented
 by Dr. Zhiqiang Shen from Shanghai Astronomical Observatory. Dr. Shen
 will visit IAA this week from Tomorrow (11/07), and later visit TIARA
 in Hsinchu for about a month for collaborations and the AGN/BH workshop.
 Dr. Shen has done significant work in studying the supermassive black hole
 Sgr A* at the Galactic Center as well as AGN in other galaxies. On Friday
 he will review in his talk the progress in the VLBI studies of Sgr A*.

        Please mark your calendar and remember to join the event!

 Regards,

 --------------------------- ASIAA Colloquium ----------------------
  Speaker : Dr. Zhiqiang Shen (Shanghai Astronomical Observatory)
  Title   : VLBI Studies of Sgr A*
  Time    : 11/10 (Fri) 2:00 PM
  Location: Rm 716
  Abstract: I will review the progress in the VLBI studies of SgrA*,
            the best known supermassive black hole candidate at the
            center of the Milky Way. The emphasis is on the importance
            of the millimeter and sub-millimeter VLBI observations in
            the detection of SgrA*'s intrinsic structure and search
            for the structural variation.
