Subject: Massive Star Formation conference Sept. 2007

Dear Colleagues,

we would appreciate if you could forward this conference announcement
to those people interested in massive star formation.

Thanks a lot and best regards

 Henrik

This is the first announcement for a conference dedicated to

"Massive Star Formation: Observations confront Theory"

to be held from September 10th to 14th 2007 in Heidelberg/Germany.

Objectives
==========
Although high-mass stars shape the interstellar medium, star clusters
and whole galaxies tremendously throughout their whole lifetime, the
actual massive star formation processes are still poorly understood.
This meeting will gather the astrophysical community working
theoretically and observationally in the field of massive star
formation. Various theoretical concepts for the formation of massive
stars are currently discussed, and it is important to derive
predictions which can be tested observationally, and which
discriminate between the various models. Furthermore, new
observations, ranging from cm and (sub)mm wavelengths to the Infrared
and X-ray regime, reveal intriguing features requiring theoretical
explanations.

Observationally, the Galactic plane surveys from Spitzer (GLIMPSE and
MIPSGAL) are expected to reveal many new insights, the submm regime
will be exploited with new instruments like APEX and the SMA, existing
observatories are significantly upgraded (e.g., PdBI, IRAM30m, JCMT,
VLA, VLTI), CARMA is coming online soon, and new telescopes like ALMA,
Herschel, and LBT are at the horizon.

>From the theoretical/modeling perspective, the ever-increasing
computational power allows to incorporate more and more physical and
chemical parameters important for the formation of massive stars and
their surrounding clusters.  It is an important goal of this meeting
that the different "disciplines" in high-mass star formation research
interact, and together try to solve the outstanding questions of
massive star formation.

The format of the meeting should stress new results. A few selected
reviews will be given outlining the current status of the several
sub-fields, but the major focus will be on the presentation and
discussion of the recent results and the implications for the
formation of massive stars. Controversial discussion to constrain the
potential and limitations of observations, theory and modeling will be
highly encouraged. Furthermore, selected open panel discussions about
the hottest current topics may even better constrain the directions
the massive star formation community should head for.

Topics
======
1. The earliest stages of high-mass star formation: Initial conditions
   and early collapse
2. Properties and evolution of massive protostars
3. Clustered massive star formation
4. Feedback (outflows, turbulence, dust and gas bubbles, ionization)
5. Massive Star Formation in a Galactic Context
6. Extragalactic star formation
7. Future perspectives for observational, theoretical and modeling tools

Panel discussions & their moderators
====================================
- Theoretical models and observational constraints for high-mass star
formation (moderator: H. Zinnecker)

- What is a massive protostar? Theoretical definitions, observational
criteria and evolutionary sequence (moderator: N. Evans)

Location
========
This conference will be held in the Heidelberg Convention Center
(Kongresshaus Stadthalle Heidelberg) located directly in the center of
downtown Heidelberg overlooking the river Neckar.

The venue is a beautiful old (1903) building equipped with all modern
conference facilities. Due to its central location, hotels, touristic
sights, the castle and numerous restaurants are all within walking
distance.

Heidelberg hosts one of the oldest Universities of Europe, and it has
ever been an academic center over a wide field of research areas. The
city has five astrophysical institutes, and a large community is
interested in star formation research.

Web-site and Registration
=========================
Additional information on this meeting can be found at

http://www.mpia.de/MSF07/

There will be ample room for contributed talks and posters. The
registration will at the beginning of 2007. If you want to be
added to the email-list for additional announcements about the
conference, just write an email to beuther@mpia.de.

Hope to see you in Heidelberg next year!

Representing the SOC and LOC,

       Henrik Beuther
