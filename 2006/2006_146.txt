Dear Prof. Kuan,

  Could you please help to post the following message on TAN.
  Thank you very much.

JOB OPENING
Institute of Astronomy
NATIONAL CENTRAL UNIVERSITY


The Astronomy Institute of National Central University 
solicits applications for 1-2 postdoctoral scientists 
to work on the Pan-STARRS (Panoramic Survey Telescope 
and Rapid Response System), a niche project led by 
University of Hawaii (http://pan-starrs.ifa.hawaii.edu/).
Together with other university groups in Taiwan, we 
will join an elite international consortium to operate 
the project and take advantage of the unique, huge 
dataset, some terabytes worth of sky images per night 
in full operation.   

The positions are available immediately and successful 
candidates are expected to spend a significant fraction 
of time in Hawaii working on data processing and analysis 
pipelines, and developing their own science applications. 
Salary and fringe benefits are commensurate to the 
experience on the standard university scales, plus overseas 
allowances.  A successful candidate should have a PhD in 
astronomy, astrophysics, physics, information engineering 
or mathematics, and should be familiar with programming or 
database management.  The application should include a CV, 
a statement of research interests and three names from whom 
recommendation letters can be requested, and send to Prof. 
W. P. Chen, Institute of Astronomy, National Central University
, 300 Jhongda Road, Chung-Li 32054 Taiwan.  Inquiries about 
the positions can be directed to Prof. Chen 
(wchen@astro.ncu.edu.tw or +886-3-422-3424).

> Subject: [Colloquium] ASIAA Colloquia Next Week (09/04-09/08)

 Dear all,

	Next week, Dr. Shigehisa Takakuwa and Ms. Satoko Takahashi, both
 from NAOJ, will visit IAA. As many of you know, Shigehisa was a postdoc
 at IAA and remains to be a good friend to many of us. Satoko, formally 
 a Ph. D. student of Dr. Masao Saito and Dr. Ryohei Kawabe, is working 
 on star formation in OMC-2/3 and expecting to receive her degree next 
 March. 

	Next Monday (09/04), Ms. Takahashi will present a special
 colloquium talk titled "Millimeter- and submillimeter-observations 
 toward intermediate mass protostars and associated outflows in OMC-2/3".

	Next Friday (09/08), Dr. Takakuwa will present a colloquium
 talk titled "ASTE Observations of Low-mass Protostellar Envelopes in 
 Submillimeter Molecular Lines & ACA Imaging Simulations for Star-forming 
 Regions"

	Please notice the special MONDAY talk. Mark your calendar and 
 remember to join these talks!

 Regards,

 sheng-yuan

Second Circular

Asian Radio Astronomy Winter School
January 22-26, 2007
National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ), Mitaka, Tokyo, Japan


Registration:
We would like to open the registration for the Asian Radio Astronomy
Winter School. Please visit the on-line registration page on our web
site (http://vsop.mtk.nao.ac.jp/RAWS2007/), and fill out all items in
the registration form.
========================================================================
   The deadline for registration *with financial support* is October 6,
   2006. The final deadline for registration is November 3, 2006.
========================================================================
There will be a registration fee of about 10,000 Japanese Yen (JPY),
which includes a paper copy of the textbook, inspection of the Nobeyama
Radio Observatory, banquet, coffee/tea, and other miscellaneous items.
It should be paid at the registration desk only in cash (JPY).

The Winter School is especially aimed towards young scientists and
graduate students, who are interested in radio astronomy, but more
advanced researchers in this field or others are also welcome. The
maximum number of acceptable participants will be limited to 100 people
because of the capacity of the lecture room. We will select the
attendees after the registration is closed, and the results will be
informed immediately after the selection.
========================================================================
   Please note that, due to limited capacity (100 people), your
   participation is not guaranteed until the LOC informs you of the
   results of the selection, even if your registration is received on
   time.
========================================================================


Accommodation:
We have block bookings during January 21-27 at the observatory dormitory
"Cosmos-Kaikan" located at the NAOJ Mitaka campus. Due to limited
capacities, the number of available rooms is only thirteen (ten singles,
two twins, and one triple).  Should the number of requests exceed the
capacities, priority will be given to students from overseas.
The LOC will arrange other hotel accommodations near the Mitaka campus.
Please select the preferred type of accommodation in the on-line
registration form. If you wish to share a room, we will try to pair you
up with other attendee(s). If so, please advise the LOC via email before
October 6. The results of arrangements will be informed after the
registration is closed.


Financial support:
We can offer some financial support to encourage student participation
in the Winter School. The support will be provided in the form of a
partial reimbursement of the transportation and/or accommodation
expenses. If you need financial support, the on-line registration must
be made by October 6, 2006. Later, by mid-October, applicants who have
requested financial support will be informed of the details of the
support. All the applicants are expected to have some financial support
within the available funding. Please note that the support will not be
guaranteed for applicants who registered after October 6.


Visa:
Some of the attendees from outside Japan are required to have
a visa issued from the Japanese embassy. Please see
"A Guide to Japanese Visas" in detail.
(http://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/index.html)
If you need a visa, please contact the LOC via e-mail. We will issue
an invitation letter for your request.

The preliminary program is given in the following table.
The final version of the program will be described in the third circular
