Title: "Rotation in Gravitational Lenses"
Abstract:
Gravitational lensing deflects light. A single lens deflector can only
shear images, but cannot induce rotations. Multiple lens planes can
induce rotations. Such rotations can be observed in quadruply imaged
sources, and can be used to distinguish between two proposed solutions
of the flux anomaly problem: substructures in lensing galaxies versus
large-scale structure. We predict the expected amount of rotation due
to large-scale structure in strong lensing systems, and show how this
effect can be measured using ??mas very long baseline interferometry
astrometry of quadruple lenses with extended source structures. The
magnitude of rotation is around 1??. The biggest theoretical
uncertainty is the power spectrum of dark matter on very small
scales. This procedure can potentially be turned around to measure the
dark matter power spectrum on very small scales. We compute the
predicted rms rotation angles for several quadruple lenses with known
lens and source redshifts.

Title: Self-Induced Starburst at the Molecular Superbubble in M82
Abstract:
M82 is one of the nearest starburst galaxies, and therefore well
suited for a case study about starburst.  We obtained a high spatial
resolution (2.3"x1.9" or 43 pc x 36 pc) 100 GHz continuum emission
image with the Nobeyama Millimeter Array toward an expanding molecular
superbubble in the central region of M82.  The 100 GHz continuum
image, which is dominated by free-free emission, revealed that the
strongest peaks are concentrated at the inner edge of the superbubble
along the galactic disk.  At these regions, high-velocity ionized gas
can be seen, and masers are also concentrated.  The center of the
superbubble, on the other hand, is weak in molecular and free-free
emissions and strong in diffuse hard X-ray emission.  These
observations suggest that a strong starburst produced energetic
explosions, and the resultant plasma and superbubble expansions
induced the present starburst regions traced by our 100 GHz continuum
observations at the inner edge of the molecular superbubble.  These
results, therefore, provide the first clear evidence of self-induced
starburst in external galaxies.

Title: Evolution of circumstellar disks around intermediate mass young stars
Abstract: 
One of the major successes of modern star formation theory has been
the prediction that the circumstellar disks are inevitable by-products
of the star formation process.  There is now overwhelming
observational evidence for the presence of such disks around a
majority of young pre-main sequence (PMS) stars. The observed
peculiarities of these young stars are generally attributed to their
circumstellar environment.
In the early PMS phase, young stars actively accrete matter from the
surrounding disk.  As the star evolves, the disk accretion rate goes
down and eventually the accretion is terminated. By the time the
central stars reach the main sequence, young circumstellar disks
surrounding them lose most of the material due to planet formation and
other disk dispersal processes. A detailed study of the disk evolution
is critically important to our understanding of the planet formation
and other disk dispersal mechanisms and their associated
timescales. We have been trying to trace the evolution of
circumstellar disks from the early PMS phase to the late main sequence
phase, using several observational diagnostics (emission-line
activity, infrared excesses, polarisation) of the disks and by
following their evolution in time. In my talk, I will present some of
our recent results and discuss their implications.
