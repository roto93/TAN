Loc.: Room 1013, Science Building IV, National Central University
Speaker: Prof. Lee Chin-Shuang (Physics Department, NCU)
Title: The light emission produced by using different ion species
       bombarding various mixed ices
Abstract:
In the interstellar medium and planets, water (the most abundant of
materials) and many other gases were formed into grains and dust. They
experienced constant irradiation by solar wind and radiation. In order
to simulate the above condition in the earth laboratory, several ion
species are applied to bombard several ices targets, which consist of
gases (for examples, CH[4] and NH[3]) mixed with iced water. The
optical spectroscopy of sputtered particles from the surface of mixed
ices has been measured. According to the P.  Sigmund's model [1], if
the projectiles with the same beam energy, then heavier ion will
generate more sputtered particles. It turned out that in this
measurement the heavier incident ion produced stronger light
intensity, which should be proportional to sputtered particles.
The optical emissions produce by ion species can be classified two
categories: (a) Light emissions of hydrogen molecular spectroscopy are
generated by hydrogen molecular ion species bombarding mixed ices with
water. (b) Light emissions of atomic transitions are produced by
projectiles of He^+, N^+, H[2] O^+, N[2]^+, and Ar^+.
The experiment of ion interaction with mixed ices can be used to
simulate conditions occurred in the astrophysics [2, 3].

Date: 11:00, 18/April/2006
Loc.: Room 1013, Science Building IV, National Central University
Speaker: Dr. Pavlos Protopapas (CfA, USA)
Title: Fast identification of transits from light-curves in TAOS
Abstract:
I will present an algorithm that allows fast and efficient detection
of transits, including planetary transits, from light-curves. The
method is based on building an ensemble of fiducial models and
compressing the data. I will describe the method and demonstrate its
efficiency by finding planet-like transits in simulated TAOS
light-curves. We show that that our method is independent of the size
of the search space of transit parameters.

Dear Colleagues,

The ASIAA receiver lab and the AMiBA team need your help.  Could you  
help us to circulate these positions?  Or it would be greatly  
appreciate if you could help to post it in your department  BBS?   
Thanks a lots.

Best Regards,

----------------------
Position one:
Telescope Testing/operator, AMiBA. Academia Sinica, Institute of  
Astronomy and Astrophysics. The Array for Microwave Background  
Anisotropy project is looking for ONE (1) full-time employees for the  
AMiBA telescope testing and operations.  The positions will be based  
in Hilo, Hawaii, in the facility of the ASIAA Hawaii Operations.   
Continuation of employment is dependent upon program/operational  
needs, satisfactory work performance, and availability of funds.
Salary level: is in accordance with AS system, with extra supplement  
and benefits for living in Hawaii.


Duties: Assist the testing and the telescope operation of the Array  
for the Microwave Background Anisotropy (AMiBA).  May also assist  
engineering and scientific staff in the array testing as necessary.   
Major duties include carrying out routine and unplanned pointing  
tests on the AMiBA telescope, provide service in characterizing and  
analyzing the pointing data based on the existing model and  
knowledge; telescope driving software implementation, modifications,  
and upgrades; documentation of the telescope pointing quality.

Qualifications:

Education: Bachelor degree or higher, in science or engineering  
department.  Major in physical science is preferred.  Astronomy  
background with strong interest in cosmology is a plus.

Experience: One year of hand-on experience in astronomical  
observation related training.  One or more years of work experience  
with professional astronomical observatory is a plus.

Abil/Know/Skills: Familiar with programming skill under Linux and  
Window environment.  Proficient in GUI interface programming is a  
plus.  Must hold a valid, current driving license and be able to  
drive 4-wheel drive vehicles with manual transmission.  Able to  
provide clear and concise self-expression in Englishâ^À^Ó verbal and  
written.

Desirable Qualifications: Must be able to work at 11,000 feet, and  
pass a high-altitude medical examination. Able to communicate in  
Mandarin is a plus

Inquiries: Ming-Tang Chen (808) 961-2931 (Hawaii). Or e-mail:  
mchen@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw.  For application, please e-mail your  
resume, and a cover letter concerning this position application.    
The closing date for these positions is April 30, 2006.


Position Two:
å^Ü^Ëé^Ø²å½¹:
For those who interested in astronomical instrumentation, we still  
have two military reserve positions opened for you.  We are looking  
for talented person who desires to participate in forefront  
experiments.  You would get the opportunity to work in a team who has  
been conducting main-stream science experiments in astronomy.  Please  
hurry up!  Time is running out for this year.  Please contact Ming- 
Tang Chen for further details, or write to mchen@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw.
