Call for SMA proposals for 2006B

Dear Colleagues,

Proposals are solicited for the ASIAA time of the Submillimeter
Array (SMA) for the period from November 6th, 2006, to April 30th,
2007.  Those who are affiliated to Taiwanese universities or
Taiwanese research institutes are eligible to apply for the ASIAA
SMA time as a principal investigator (PI).

The deadline for proposal submission for the ASIAA SMA time
for the next semester is September 8 (Friday), 2006, 4AM in the
morning (Taiwan time).  (The deadline corresponds to September 7
(Thursday), 2006, 10AM HST in Hawaii, USA.)

All SMA proposals must be submitted through the SMA submission
facility (https://sma1.sma.hawaii.edu/propose.html).
When submitting your proposal, please make sure to select
"ASIAA" as your destination TAC in the submission web page.
Please submit your proposal early.  If you encounter any technical
problem with the submission facility, please contact TATSUHIKO
HASEGAWA (hasegawa@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw).

For technical information on the SMA, please visit
    http://sma1.sma.hawaii.edu/proposing.html .
For Taiwan and ASIAA specific aspects (including the ASIAA
proposal selection process and the amount of available
observing time), please visit
    http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/~SMART/ .

The SMA is a complex instrument.  Consultation or collaboration
with those who are familiar with the SMA is highly recommended.
Contact points for consultations are also found in the above
web page.

Additional messages from the ASIAA SMA TAC

In order to encourage PhD students to use the SMA, the ASIAA SMA TAC
will make some considerations to proposals for PhD thesis projects in
the coming round of proposal selection.  If a PhD student (as PI) and
the supervisor (as co-investigator, Co-I) have a definite plan to use
the proposed SMA observations as a main material for the student's PhD
thesis, please state so in the proposal (in the Technical Justification
part of the proposal).  Additional supporting statements [such as the
total amount of observations planned and the timeline (over a few years)
for data acquisition, data processing, data analysis, and thesis writing]
would also help the ASIAA SMA TAC understand the situation for the PhD
candidate and supervisor.

In order to make efficient use of SMA data, the ASIAA SMA TAC will expect
Co-Is to follow up the analysis and publication of already executed or
allocated projects under a PI who becomes unable to do the work for
various reasons.  Potential co-investigators should be aware of their
possible responsibilities or obligations.  PIs should make best efforts
to obtain a consent before putting someone's name on a proposal as a
Co-I.

Sincerely,

Tatsuhiko Hasegawa
ASIAA SMA TAC Chair

Astronomy, University of Southampton, UK
 
Title:  X-ray Binaries and their long term variations

Abstract: X-ray binaries are luminous and variable X-ray sources.   Apart
from the regular variations such as eclipses, many of them exhibit irregular
variability in their X-ray and/or optical fluxes on time scales from seconds
to months. In particular, the observations from both ground and space, we
have found long-term variations in a number of luminous X-ray sources that
cannot be orbital in nature but must be due to the physical properties of
the accretion discs. In this talk, I will briefly introduce X-ray binaries
and their long term variation phenomena. I then explain how can we use these
temporal characteristics to investigate the undergoing physical processes in
the accretion discs.

 Dear all,

	This Friday (08/18), Prof. Yi Chou will visit from National 
 Central University. Prof. Chou has been working on subjects related
 to high energy astrophysics and close binaries. On Friday, he will
 give a talk titled "Anomalous Phase Variation & Energy-dependent 
 Pulse Arrival Time for the Accretion-powered Millisecond Pulsars"

	Please mark your calendar and remember to join!

 Regards,

 sheng-yuan

> Subject: Call for Proposals for CFHT 2007A

The 3.6 meter optical/infrared Canadian-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) is 
now open for proposals from all Taiwan-based researchers for semester 2007A. 
The deadline for proposal submission is:

             21 September 2006 - 11:00 pm Taiwan time

Detailed information on the telescope, available instrumentation, proposal 
format, and how to submit proposals is available from the CFHT web page: 
http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/ObsInfo/ObservingProposals/

The Taiwan-CFHT Time Assignment Committee (TAC) would like to bring to your 
attention the Queued Service Observation (QSO) snapshot program.  These are 
programs that can be executed with either MegaCam or WIRCam in relatively 
poor seeing conditions when the seeing is >1.2".  More information on this 
program can be found at: 
http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/Instruments/Queue/qso_2007a_MP.html

Projects executed under the QSO program are not charged to the available 
observing time for Taiwan.  Proposals to the QSO pogram will not be 
refereed, but will be scrutinized by the TAC for scientific value and 
feasibilty.

Please note that the infrared camera WIRCam is open for the second time for 
Large Programs in 2007A.

If your scheduled project from previous semesters was not completed for any 
reason (including bad weather), you will need to resumbmit your proposal 
explaining why you need more time.  Your proposal will be stronger if the 
available data has been analyzed, and you use this data to demonstrate that 
the stated science goals can be achieved with allocation of the full 
requested time.

All new proposals, and where deemed necessary resubmitted proposals, are 
refereed by researchers selected by the Taiwan-CFHT TAC based on their 
demonstrated expertise in the relevant research fields.  Apart from the 
referees comments, who are asked to evaluate primarily the scientific 
strength of the proposal, the Taiwan-CFHT TAC also takes into account 
technical feasibility.  For those who have previously been scheduled 
observing time on the CFHT, the Taiwan-CFHT TAC will also take into account 
the status of previously executed projects and publications, which should 
therefore be adequtely described in the relevant section of the proposal.

Shiang-Yu
