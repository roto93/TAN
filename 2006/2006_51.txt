Title: Structure and Kinematics of CO (J=2-1) Emission in the Central
       Region of NGC4258
Abstract :
We present CO(2-1) observations towards the central region of the 
Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC4258 with the Submillimeter Array (SMA). The galaxy 
is well known to exhibit a sub-pc-scale molecular disk traced by water 
masers. The major axis of the disk is along the east-west direction 
although the P.A. of the host galaxy is around 150 degree. This 
indicates a significantly misalignment between the axes of rotation for 
the galaxy and for the nuclear disk. Until now, the morphological and 
kinematical connections between the host galaxy and the nuclear disk 
have not been elucidated. Our observations achieve an angular 
resolution of ~100pc to see the intermediate scale between the two 
different scales in the galaxy. Our CO(2-1) intensity map shows that 
two arm-like elongated structures along the major axis of the galaxy 
with no strong nuclear concentration, and has a similar morphology as 
seen in the previous CO(1-0) results. We find the difference of 
CO(2-1)/CO(1-0) intensity ratio between the two elongated structures. 
The higher line ratio could be due to relatively higher gas densities 
within CO clumps or higher external heating.  The velocity field 
reveals large velocity offset (+- 150 km/s) from the galactic 
rotational on the region with the higher line ratio. The region with 
the higer line ratio and the large velocity offset from the galactic 
rotation could be excited by the nuclear activities like its AGN or 
jets from the central engine.  After removal of the general galactic 
rotational motion, a velocity gradient which spans ~250pc close to the 
center is found along the east-west direction. The gas rotation within 
50pc which aligns the inner sub-parsec disk is a possible scenario to 
explain the velocity-gradient.

Title: Chemical Properties of Molecular Clouds in our Galactic Center
Abstract:
In our Galactic center there exist various active components,
including a black hole candidate, Sgr A*, and powerful supernova
remnants. Neutral gas is also strongly concentrated in the Galactic
center, which is thought to be affected strongly by the activities of
the Galactic center. By interactions with the active components, the
molecular clouds in our Galactic center show features which are
exciting but complex and difficult to interpret. Using the
millimeter-wave observations of complex molecules, we reveal
interesting physical and chemical properties of the Sgr A and Sgr B2
molecular clouds.
