> Subject: Call for SMA proposals for ASIAA time 

Dear Colleagues,

Proposals are solicited for the ASIAA time of the Submillimeter Array (SMA) for 
the period from May 1st to October 31st, 2006.  Those who are affilited to 
Taiwanese universities or Taiwanese research institutes are eligible to apply 
for the ASIAA SMA observing time as a principal investigator (PI).

The deadline for proposal submission for the SMA ASIAA time for the next 
semester is March 10, 2006, 5AM [not 5PM] CST in Taiwan.  (The deadline 
corresponds to March 9, 2006, 11AM HST in Hawaii, USA).

All SMA proposals must be submitted through the SMA submission facility 
(https://sma1.sma.hawaii.edu/propose.html). When you submit your proposal, 
please make sure to select "ASIAA" as your destination TAC in the submission 
web page. Please submit your proposal early enough.  If you encounter any 
technical problem to use this facility, please contact Tatsuhiko Hasegawa 
(hasegawa@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw).

For technical information on the SMA, please see
     http://sma1.sma.hawaii.edu/proposing.html .
For Taiwan and ASIAA specific aspects (including the ASIAA proposal selection 
process and the amount of available observing time), please visit
     http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/~SMART/ . The SMA is a complex instrument. 
Consultation or collaboration with those who are familiar with the SMA is 
highly recommended, and the contact points are also found in the above web 
pages.

Regards,

Tatsuhiko Hasegawa
