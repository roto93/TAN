Second Circular

The 2006 Annual Meeting of the Chinese Astronomical Society (Taiwan)

National Museum of Natural Science, Taichung
April 28-30 (Friday to Sunday), 2006
-------------------------------------------------------------

The CAST2006 is drawing near and we are getting ready to see you all at
the meeting.  It is expected to be an exciting event, with some 130 who
registered to participate, 24 talks, and 58 posters.

The meeting will be held at the National Museum of Natural Science in 
Taichung,
from April 28 to 30.  In the evening of April 28 from 7:30 pm to 9 pm there
will be a reception party at the Museum (outside the main building in a large 
hall way in front of the main entrance).  You are invited to come to 
socialize,
and enjoy the refreshments.  The registration begins at the same time.

On April 29 (Saturday), the registration starts at 8 am.  The opening ceremony
begins at 9 am, followed by the scientific sessions, including two featured 
speeches by Charles Alcock and Jay Pasachoff.  In the evening of April 29 the 
ALMA-Taiwan team will hold a reception and town meeting at the nearby
Splendor Hotel.  The scientific sessions resume on Sunday, April 30, at 9, 
until soon after noon.

For those who are giving oral presentations.  Each talk is 12 minutes plus 2
minute questions.  Each speaker should copy the electronic file to the 
conference laptop machine(s) in the lecture room before the session starts.

For posters, the size of the board is 90 cm (width) x 120 cm (height).  
They could be put up from Saturday morning to Sunday noon.  Authors are 
encouraged to stand by their posters during breaks, especially between 3:30 
to 4 pm on Saturday when the judgement for poster awards will be conducted.  
The winners would be arranged to make a two-minute presentation at 10:30 am 
on Sunday.  

The National Museum of Natural Science in Taichung, where the CAST2006 will
be held, is one of the most elaborate science museums on the island
and stands quite unique in Asia with many interesting exhibitions and special
collections.  So in addition to interacting with colleagues and attending 
talks and reading posters, please take a chance to tour around the Museum.

The agenda and list of oral presentations are attached below. For further
