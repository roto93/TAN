Dear Yi-Jehng,

Can you post this letter to the TAN?  Thanks.

Dear Colleagues,

TIARA is hosting a workshop on AGN and Black Holes from Nov 27 to Dec 7 in
the NTHU office.  The organizing committee would like to invite you
to participate in this event.  It is an excellent opportunity to exchange
ideas and to explore collaboration possibilities.  The detailed program can
be found on the workshop website

Best,

Mike J. Cai
