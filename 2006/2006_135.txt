Title:  X-ray Binaries and their long term variations

Abstract: X-ray binaries are luminous and variable X-ray sources.   Apart
from the regular variations such as eclipses, many of them exhibit irregular
variability in their X-ray and/or optical fluxes on time scales from seconds
to months. In particular, the observations from both ground and space, we
have found long-term variations in a number of luminous X-ray sources that
cannot be orbital in nature but must be due to the physical properties of
the accretion discs. In this talk, I will briefly introduce X-ray binaries
and their long term variation phenomena. I then explain how can we use these
temporal characteristics to investigate the undergoing physical processes in
the accretion discs.
