<<Subaru 2006B Call for Proposals>>

 Dear Colleague:

 - Please ignore this if you have already received a Japanese
 version of this message. We apologize for any duplicate mailings. -

This is to announce the opening of "The Call for Proposals for
Subaru Open Use semester S06B (from 2006 Aug. 1 to 2007 Jan. 31:
6 months)".  Detailed Information for observing time requests is
available at our website at:

http://www.naoj.org/Observing/Proposals/Submit/call.html

Please visit this website and read the description carefully
before submitting your proposals.

The deadline for Normal/Intensive Programs is

<<< March 14, 2006, 12:00am (Noon) in JST>>> [e.g., 3.00am in UT], 

while that for the Service program is one month later than this.

Especially important points specific to this S06B semester are 
summarized as follows; our web page should be consulted
for more detailed information.

[Telescope Down Time] 
Due to the re-coating work of the Primary mirror, the telescope 
will be shut down from the beginning to the middle of August, 2006.

[Time Exchange with Gemini]
Subaru users can apply to Gemini GMOS and NIFS in this S06B
semester. In this time exchange, Gemini observations will be 
performed in the queue mode and about 5 nights (50 hours) will 
be available.

[Opening of MOIRCS Spectroscopy Mode]
In addition to the imaging mode which is already opened 
since S06A, the low-resolution spectroscopic mode of MOIRCS 
is going to become available since this S06B semester, 
though with a shared-risk operation. 

Best regards,

 The Subaru Open Use Team
