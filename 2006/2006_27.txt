                               Colloquium
                      at the Institute of Astronomy,
                       National Central University

Date: 24 February 2006
Time: 14:00-15:00
Loc.: Room 1013, Science Building IV, National Central University

Speaker: Dr. MOTOYAMA Kazutaka (TIARA, Taiwan)

Title: Radiation driven implosion model for high accretion rate of protostar

Abstract:
We investigated how radiation driven implosion affects on star
formation nearby massive star. UV radiation from massive star ionizes
surface of molecular cloud and compress it. This process is known as
Radiation Driven Implosion(RDI). If RDI trigger star formation,
accretion rate and final mass of protostar would be affected by
RDI. Using numerical simulation, we revealed that RDI enhanced
accretion rate > 10^{-4} M_sun / yr. We also reveled that final mass
of protostar depends on density profile of cloud.
