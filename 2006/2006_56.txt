Title: "Worlds in Collision: New Results from Spitzer Concerning the
       Evolution of Debris Disks Surrounding A Stars"
Abstract:
Circumstellar and debris disks are the most visible signposts of other
planetary systems, representing indirect evidence of planet
formation. Debris disks primarily arise from collisions of asteroidal
(or planetesimal) bodies that result in cascades of collisions among
the resulting debris. Because of the large surface area of the dust
grains per unit mass, they can produce a readily detectable level of
excess emission in the mid- and far-infrared. The behavior of these
infrared excesses can trace the different zones within a planetary
system. Pioneering studies with IRAS and ISO suggest a systematic drop
in infrared excess with stellar age. However, because of limitations
in the sensitivity and photometric accuracy, they were unable to show
unambiguously how debris disks evolve. Spitzer brings great advances
in both sensitivity and photometric accuracy, allowing infrared
excesses to be detected to low levels around hundreds of stars. In
this talk I will present recent studies of infrared excesses at 24 and
70 um, based on a sample of 160 A-type stars observed with
Spitzer. The behavior of infrared excesses qualitatively agrees with
previous studies, suggesting a decline of debris disk activity with
stellar age. However, there is a large variety of excess amounts at
any given age; in addition, the 24 um excesses decay more rapidly than
those at 70 um, suggesting that the disk clearing process is from the
inside outward. These new results show both a large range in initial
planetary system structures and also that individual disks may be
dominated by debris created in individual events. Detailed modeling of
two systems, Vega and HD 69830, shows that short-lived small dust
particles dominate the radiometric properties of the disk. These two
systems are most likely the sites of major debris-producing incidents
that occurred within roughly the past million years. Our new Spitzer
observations show that planetary formation is a chaotic process.

Title: Nature of asteroid (25143) Itokawa observed by Hayabusa
       spacecraft
Abstract:
The Hayabusa (MUSES-C) spacecraft, which was designed to acquire
sample from the surface of an asteroid and return to Earth, was in
close proximity to the near-Earth asteroid 25143 Itokawa (1998 SF36)
in September through November 2005. During rendezvous with the
asteroid, a telescopic imaging camera (AMICA), a near-infrared
spectrometer (NIRS), a laser ranging instrument (LIDAR), and an X-ray
fluorescence spectrometer (XRS) had observed the surface of
Itokawa. We present a nature of Itokawa, and scientific results
obtained from the observation by Hayabusa spacecraft.
