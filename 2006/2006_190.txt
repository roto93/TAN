Dear Colleagues,

Twenty years have passed since the neutrinos from Supernova SN1987A were
observed. We have organized a conference at Waikoloa, Hawaii on February 23
to 25, 2007 to discuss what we have learned about supernovae and what could
be learned from a future supernova.

The following second bulletin includes a preliminary conference program.
The deadline for a discount registration fee is December 20, 2006.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you plan to attend the conference we recommend that you register as soon
as possible.

Best Regards,
Hank Sobel and Masayuki Nakahata for LOC of conference

                     Twenty Years after SN1987A
                     ==========================
            What did we learn, what will the next SN tell us?
            -------------------------------------------------
                   February 23, 24 and 25, 2007
                     Hilton Waikoloa, Hawaii

Bulletin 2
==========
1. General Announcement:
========================
On February 23, 1987, detectors on Earth recorded a pulse of neutrinos
emitted
by SN1987A. This historic event was the first and only detection of
neutrinos
from outside of our solar system. We plan a conference at the Hilton
Waikoloa
near Kona on the Big Island of Hawaii on February 23 to 25, 2007, the 20th
anniversary of this event. The conference will review what we have learned
about supernovae in the past twenty years and what a future supernova might
tell us. Talks are by invitation only. Scientific topics include: the
history
of SN1987A, theoretical developments in understanding supernovae and their
environments, neutrino properties and what supernovae can teach us about
them,
and present and planned neutrino detectors.

Detailed information on the conference is found at the conference web site:
http://sn1987a-20th.physics.uci.edu/.

Email may be sent to the local organizing committee (LOC) at:
sn1987a@suketto.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp

2. Preliminary Scientific Program:
==================================
The preliminary program of the conference is attached at the end of this
bulletin. It is also available on the conference web site.


3. Poster Session:
==================
There will be a poster session; the subject of the poster must be relevant
to
the conference theme. If you wish to make such a presentation please submit
an abstract to the LOC. They will supply you with the details of space and
mounting after the poster is accepted.

4. Registration:
================
Registration is via the conference web site. Please register as soon as
possible. Conference registration includes coffee breaks and the conference
banquet. There is a $75 cancellation fee for cancellations made prior to
February 15, 2007. Cancellations made after February 15, 2007 are
non-refundable.

Registration Fees are as Follows:
---------------------------------
* Standard Registration (before December 20, 2006): $350
* Late Conference Registration (December 21, 2006 - February 15, 2007) -
$400
* On-Line Conference Registration will close on February 15, 2007.
* On-Site Registration (after February 15, 2007) - $450

Registration will take place at the Waikoloa Promenade from 5:00 to 6:00 PM
each evening starting on Feb. 22. The conference will begin on the morning
on
Feb. 23. All sessions will be in the hotel in the Waikoloa 2 facility.


5. Accommodations:
==================
The conference will take place on the Big Island of Hawaii at the Hilton
Waikoloa Village resort. A block of rooms has been reserved for conference
attendees at the Hilton Waikoloa at the government rate of $150/nt, single
or
double occupancy. This rate is exclusive of tax (currently estimated
at 11.41%). Additional roommates are $45 each plus tax. Children under 18
are
free if they use existing bed space in the room. Breakfast is not included
in
the room rate.

To obtain the special conference rate, reservations must be made through the

conference website. Reservations must be accompanied by a valid credit card
number and expiration date to hold as a deposit on your room. Your card will

not be pre-charged unless you cancel within the penalty period or you do not

arrive as scheduled. The deadline for reserving rooms is January 17, 2007,
based on availability. Please make your hotel reservations as soon as
possible.


6. Transportation to the Hilton Waikoloa Village:
=================================================
Independent taxies, a Hilton shuttle and rental cars are available. For more

details please visit the web page


7. Mauna Kea Tour:
==================
We are planning an excursion to the observatories on Mauna Kea, on the
afternoons of 22 February and 26 February, the day before and the day after
the conference. Your choice of whether or not you would like to join this
tour
and your preferred tour day is requested on the reservation webpage.

8. Miscellaneous:
=================
On October 15, 2006 an earthquake of magnitude 6.6 occurred a few miles off
the Island of Hawaii. The Hotel reports that there was no significant damage

or injuries and that all operations were normal by the next day.
