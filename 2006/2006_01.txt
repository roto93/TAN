  Dear all,

        This Friday we will have a colloquium talk presented by Dr.
  Dharam Vir Lal. Dr. Lal joined IAA just less than two months ago.
  He has been studying Seyfert galaxies at radio wavelengths. On Friday,
  he will discuss results from his GMRT studies of X-shaped radio sources.

        Please mark your calendar and remember to join!

  Regards,

  sheng-yuan

   Speaker : Dr. Dharam Vir Lal (ASIAA)
   Title   : GMRT: Study of X-shaped sources
   Time    : 01/06 (Fri) 2:00 PM
   Location: ASIAA Room 716
   Abstract:
             The Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) is a synthesis
             instrument operating at frequencies 1.4 GHz and below.
             The Frequency bands between 1400 and 240 MHz were in use
             for astronomical observations since 1999.  Although low
             frequency observations are severely affected due to radio
             frequency interference, recently, the 150 MHz band of the
             GMRT is also released for observations.  I will introduce
             the instrument and highlight its key specifications.

             The radio morphologies of X-shaped radio sources at 240 and
             610 MHz show a well-defined X-shaped structure.  For example,
             3C 223.1 has a pair of active jets along the north-south axis
             and a pair of wings along the east-west axis, that pass
            symmetrically through the undetected radio core.  Analysis of
             Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) low frequency data for
             3C 223.1 has revealed an unusual result (Lal & Rao 2004), namely,
             the wings (or low surface brightness jet) seem to have flatter
             spectral index with respect to the high surface brightness jet.
             We now have simultaneous GMRT radio data at 240 and 610 MHz,
             obtained uniformly, for almost all the X-shaped sources. Here,
             I will discuss our radio results for the sample and its
             implications for constraining the formation scenario of these
             sources.
