Dear Colleagues,

ALMA-Taiwan team will hold the 3rd ALMA-Taiwan town meeting. All the people,
who are interested in the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA)
Project, are invited to the meeting.

Date: October 21, 2006
Venue: the ASIAA, R916, Taipei
       (9th floor of the Condensed Matter Sciences and Physics
       Department Building, National Taiwan University)

ALMA is the largest ground based, international astronomical
observational facility ever built, and is a partnership of North
America, Europe, and Japan in cooperation with the Republic of Chile.
It is currently under construction in the Chajnantor area in the
Atacama desert in northern Chile. In September 2005, the Academia
Sinica (AS) in Taiwan entered into an agreement with the National
Institutes of Natural Sciences (NINS) in Japan in order to join the
ALMA project through ALMA-Japan project. ALMA will be studying a broad
range of exciting science, such as weather patterns on solar system
planets, the formation of planets and stars in our galaxy, the motions
within active galactic nuclei, and the formation of the earliest
galaxies at z~10. You can find some
more information on the project at http://alma.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw.

The town meeting will start at 11:30 am at the R916 (ALMA-T Co-I's
meeting will be held from 10:30 am at the same place). You can find
maps at http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/about/map02a.htm.

At the meeting, we will mainly talk about:

- the latest status of the ALMA project, including the ALMA-T project
- the ALMA science cases, ALMA-T science sub-working groups
- the ALMA operation plan

If you are interested in attending the meeting, please send your
registration form, attached below, to Linda Shao (lshao@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw)
BY OCT 13. We will provide lunch boxes to people who request (see the
registration form).  Even after the deadline, you can still send your
registration
form, but your lunch box may not be guaranteed. For more details of the
meeting, send email to Nagayoshi Ohashi (ohashi@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw).

We look forward to seeing all of you at the meeting!

Cheers,
Nagayaoshi Ohashi
