Title: Radially-Infalling Molecular Gas from a X-ray Cooling Flow

Abstract:
Rich groups and clusters of galaxies are immersed in hot (10^7-10^8 K)
X-ray-emitting gas that constitutes a large fraction of their baryonic mass.
Radiative cooling of this gas (by virtue of its X-ray emission), in the
absence of any heat input, should result in an inflow of relatively cool gas
to the cluster center, a location usually occupied by the most massive
elliptical (cD) galaxy in the cluster.  Although predicted nearly thirty years
ago, this classical picture of X-ray cooling flows is widely questioned as gas
at lower temperatures has not been subsequently found at levels anywhere near
the predicted quantities in the putative cooling-flow clusters searched.  Over
the last few years, observations of hot gas in galaxy clusters with the
XMM-Newton and Chandra X-ray observatories have radically upset the classical
picture of X-ray cooling flows.  The lack of detectable X-ray gas at lower
temperatures (typically in the range 10^6-10^7 K) require, at the very least,
a dramatic downward revision in cooling-flow rates, if not the lack of any
cooling flow.

Here, we report SMA observations of the molecular gas in Perseus A, the
central galaxy in the putative cooling-flow Perseus Cluster.  We show that the
 molecular gas is concentrated in three radial filaments with projected
lengths of at least ~2 kpc, one extending inwards close to the active nucleus
and the other two extending outwards to at least ~8 kpc on the east and west.
 The two outer filaments exhibit purely radial kinematics that we show trace
free fall along the gravitational potential of the galaxy.  The innermost
filament appears to be settling into the potential well, and may fuel the
central supermassive black hole whose radio jets heat gas over a large solid
angle in the north-south direction.  Our results demonstrate that X-ray
cooling flows can indeed deposit large quantities of cool gas, but only
intermittently along directions where the X-ray gas is not being reheated.
The actual mass-deposition rate is therefore considerably smaller than simple
estimates based on a classical cooling flow.
