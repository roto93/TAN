                         First Announcement

             Millimeter/sub-millimeter Interferometry School

                           (10-14 July 2006)

        Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Academia Sinica


Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics (IAA), Academia Sinica, will be
organizing a "Millimeter/sub-millimeter Interferometry School''. The school
will take place at the IAA, located in the Physics Department building of
National Taiwan University, from July 10th to July 14th, 2006.  The school is
intended for students and scientists with or without a priori knowledge of 
radio
interferometry techniques, but we expect them to have basic understanding of
applied mathematics, in particular Fourier transforms, and physics. Given the
role of sub-millimetre wave astronomy and the forthcoming next generation
Atacama Large Millimeter and sub-Millimeter Array (ALMA), the school is
devoted to lectures, tutorials, and lab activities, on millimeter wave radio
astronomy and interferometry.  It will focus on key aspects of interferometry
at millimeter wavelengths, using the sub-millimetre array (SMA) interferometer
(a collaborative project between the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory and
the Academia Sinica, Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics of Taiwan) at
Hilo, Hawaii as an example.  Activities, both lectures and laboratory
sessions, will be held in English.

Currently there is no limit on the number of participants, but if there
are too many applicants, we may restrict the total number of participants
due to lecture hall and lodging availability.

IAA will provide only shared accommodation available at the Academia Sinica
campus for participants not from Taipei city/county.  The school will cover
your lodging expenses (between 9th and 15th July, 2006) and lunch-box
during the lectures.  Participants are expected to meet their own travel and
other expenses.

Further information is placed on the IAA Web page
(http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/). Interested students and scientists should
complete the registration form at the same URL.  Informal enquiries should
be made by e-mail to int_school@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw (please specify
"Summer School" in the subject field).

Registration (Deadline: May 15, 2006)
