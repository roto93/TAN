JOB OPENING
Institute of Astronomy
NATIONAL CENTRAL UNIVERSITY


The Astronomy Institute of National Central University
solicits applications for 1-2 postdoctoral scientists
to work on the Pan-STARRS (Panoramic Survey Telescope
and Rapid Response System), a niche project led by
University of Hawaii (http://pan-starrs.ifa.hawaii.edu/).
Together with other university groups in Taiwan, we
will join an elite international consortium to operate
the project and take advantage of the unique, huge
dataset, some terabytes worth of sky images per night
in full operation.

The positions are available immediately and successful
candidates are expected to spend a significant fraction
of time in Hawaii working on data processing and analysis
pipelines, and developing their own science applications.
Salary and fringe benefits are commensurate to the
experience on the standard university scales, plus overseas
allowances.  A successful candidate should have a PhD in
astronomy, astrophysics, physics, information engineering
or mathematics, and should be familiar with programming or
database management.  The application should include a CV,
a statement of research interests and three names from whom
recommendation letters can be requested, and send to Prof.
W. P. Chen, Institute of Astronomy, National Central University
, 300 Jhongda Road, Chung-Li 32054 Taiwan.  Inquiries about
the positions can be directed to Prof. Chen
(wchen@astro.ncu.edu.tw or +886-3-422-3424).
