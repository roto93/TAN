Dear Colleagues,
the Journal of Taipei Astronomical Museum (JTAM) has entered its fourth 
year. JTAM is published jointly by the Taipei Astronomical Museum (TAM) and 
the Chinese Astronomical Society in Taiwan (CAST); currently one issue per 
year. From the 4th issue on, which is expected to appear in Dec 2006, JTAM 
will consist of the following three parts in one issue:
(1) invited articles
(2) regular articles
(3) CAST annual meeting abstracts

The JTAM editorial board invites all of you to submit your research results 
to JTAM as regular articles. An editor will be assigned to each submitted 
manuscript to be responsible for the external refereeing process. A decision 
will be made by the editorial board on the manuscript no later than 6 weeks 
after the submission. For more submission details, please visit the JTAM web 
site at <http://www.tam.gov.tw/JTAM/JTAM.asp>. Manuscript submission is 
welcome any time, but for technical reasons, to appear in the issue of the 
same year is only possible for those submitted by the end of August.

JTAM has established an¡¥Editor Award¡¦for authors without a doctor degree, 
whose articles are among the best in that issue. Decision will be made by 
the editorial board with the conferment of a certification and some amount 
of prize money.

JTAM is distributed to all the CAST members and libraries of all the 
universities and some government organizations in Taiwan. Articles of JTAM 
are also electronically accessible world wide.

We thank you for your attention and support for this journal.

                               Colloquium
                      at the Institute of Astronomy,
                       National Central University

Date: 14:00, 2/Jun/2006
Loc.: Room 1013, Science Building IV, National Central University
Speaker: Wang Shiang-Yu (ASIAA, Taiwan)
Title: WIRCam and beyond: OIR instrumentation plan in IAA
Abstract:
After three years of hard work, WIRCam has be proved to be a powerful
tool for astronomical reserach. Based on the experience of WIRCam, we
are looking froward to the next instrument development project. In
this talk, the possible collaborations will be introduced. They are
the next generation AO system for CFHT and the Hyper SuprimCam for
Subaru telescope. The goal of joining these project is to broaden the
instrumentation capability and also provide the possible access to 8
meter class telescopes. Also, the infrared camera for Lulin telescope
will be briefed in the talk.
