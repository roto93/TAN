            Title :  Some issues about SZ clusters and  
                    extra-galactic point sources

            Abstract :
       
            Extra-galactic point sources (Infra-Red and radio galaxies) 
            contribute together with the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect 
            to the microwave signal at small angular scales. I will start 
            by presenting how such a contribution affects the estimate 
            of cluster parameters (Compton parameter, radial peculiar 
            velocity, temperature). I will then revisit the analysis 
            of the excess of CMB power on small scales by adding a  
            possible contribution from unremoved extra-galactic point 
            sources to the SZ effect usually proposed to account for 
            this excess power.
