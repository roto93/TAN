Subject: SMA proposals for Taiwan time

Dear Colleagues,

This is a reminder that the closing date and time for SMA 
(Submillimeter Array) proposals to ASIAA SMA TAC is March 10, 
2006, 5AM (not 5pm) CST in Taiwan (March 9, 2006, 11AM HST in 
Hawaii).  This call for proposals covers the observing period 
from May 1st to October 31st, 2006.  Those who are affilited 
to Taiwanese universities or Taiwanese research institutes 
are eligible to apply for the ASIAA SMA time as a principal 
investigator (PI).

All SMA proposals must be submitted through the SMA submission 
facility (https://sma1.sma.hawaii.edu/propose.html).  When you 
submit your proposal, please make sure to select "ASIAA" as 
your destination TAC in the submission web page.  Please submit 
your proposal early enough.  If you encounter any technical 
problem to use this facility, please contact Tatsuhiko Hasegawa 
(hasegawa@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw).

For technical information on the SMA, please see

For Taiwan and ASIAA specific aspects (including the ASIAA 
proposal selection process and the amount of available 
observing time), please visit
     http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/~SMART/ . 
The SMA is a complex instrument.  Consultation or collaboration 
with those who are familiar with the SMA is highly recommended, 
and the contact points are also found in the above web pages.

Tatsuhiko Hasegawa
