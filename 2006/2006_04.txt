To those who intend to submit Suzaku AO-1 proposal,

We apologize for the trouble of ISAS network which caused
the Suzaku remote proposal submission (rps) unaccessible
from all over the world.

The network was recovered now, and we would like to set
the new deadline to

12:00 (Noon) on January 9th, 2006 (JST)

Please notice that the paper submission set (7 sets of
hardcopies) must be also posted by January 9th.

If you have already submitted to rps but have not received
automatic reply from the rps server, or if you cannot
submit proposal by the above new deadline by some reason,
please contact with rpshelp@astro.isas.jaxa.jp.


With best wishes,

      Kazuhisa Mitsuda (Suzaku Project Manager)
