Dear Colleagues,
the Journal of Taipei Astronomical Museum (JTAM) has entered its fourth
year. JTAM is published jointly by the Taipei Astronomical Museum (TAM) and
the Chinese Astronomical Society in Taiwan (CAST); currently one issue per
year. From the 4th issue on, which is expected to appear in Dec 2006, JTAM
will consist of the following three parts in one issue:
(1) invited articles
(2) regular articles
(3) CAST annual meeting abstracts

The JTAM editorial board invites all of you to submit your research results
to JTAM as regular articles. An editor will be assigned to each submitted
manuscript to be responsible for the external refereeing process. A decision
will be made by the editorial board on the manuscript no later than 6 weeks
after the submission. For more submission details, please visit the JTAM web
site at <http://www.tam.gov.tw/JTAM/JTAM.asp>. Manuscript submission is
welcome any time, but for technical reasons, to appear in the issue of the
same year is only possible for those submitted by the end of August.

JTAM has established an Editor Award for authors without a doctor degree, whose articles are among the best in that issue. Decision will be made by the editorial board with the conferment of a certification and some amount of prize money.

JTAM is distributed to all the CAST members and libraries of all the
universities and some government organizations in Taiwan. Articles of JTAM
are also electronically accessible world wide.

We thank you for your attention and support for this journal.
