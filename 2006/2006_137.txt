> Subject: Call for Proposals for CFHT 2007A

The 3.6 meter optical/infrared Canadian-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) is
now open for proposals from all Taiwan-based researchers for semester 2007A.
The deadline for proposal submission is:

             21 September 2006 - 11:00 pm Taiwan time

Detailed information on the telescope, available instrumentation, proposal
format, and how to submit proposals is available from the CFHT web page:
http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/ObsInfo/ObservingProposals/

The Taiwan-CFHT Time Assignment Committee (TAC) would like to bring to your
attention the Queued Service Observation (QSO) snapshot program.  These are
programs that can be executed with either MegaCam or WIRCam in relatively
poor seeing conditions when the seeing is >1.2".  More information on this
program can be found at:
http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/Instruments/Queue/qso_2007a_MP.html

Projects executed under the QSO program are not charged to the available
observing time for Taiwan.  Proposals to the QSO pogram will not be
refereed, but will be scrutinized by the TAC for scientific value and
feasibilty.

Please note that the infrared camera WIRCam is open for the second time for
Large Programs in 2007A.

If your scheduled project from previous semesters was not completed for any
reason (including bad weather), you will need to resumbmit your proposal
explaining why you need more time.  Your proposal will be stronger if the
available data has been analyzed, and you use this data to demonstrate that
the stated science goals can be achieved with allocation of the full
requested time.

All new proposals, and where deemed necessary resubmitted proposals, are
refereed by researchers selected by the Taiwan-CFHT TAC based on their
demonstrated expertise in the relevant research fields.  Apart from the
referees comments, who are asked to evaluate primarily the scientific
strength of the proposal, the Taiwan-CFHT TAC also takes into account
technical feasibility.  For those who have previously been scheduled
observing time on the CFHT, the Taiwan-CFHT TAC will also take into account
the status of previously executed projects and publications, which should
therefore be adequtely described in the relevant section of the proposal.

On behalf of CFHT TAC committee
