> Dear Colleague,
>
> The 2nd pan-ALMA conference on "Science with ALMA: a new era for
> Astrophysics" will be held 13-16 November 2006 in Madrid, Spain. The
> venue will be the campus of the CSIC (Consejo Superior de
> Investigaciones Cientificas), in the centre of town.

> Scope of Symposium
> __________________
> Currently under construction in the Andean Altiplano, Northern Chile,
> the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) is an international radio
> interferometer with about 7000 m2 of collecting area comprised of 64
> (50) 12-m antennas. Initially covering the most interesting spectral
> wavelength ranges from 3 to 0.3 mm, ALMA will be a revolutionary
> telescope providing astronomy with the first detailed view of the dark
> and youngest objects of the Universe.
>
> The scientific preparations for ALMA are being extremely active since
> the birth of the project. The various science committees, groups of
> astronomers working for ALMA, and regional communities interested in
> the project meet regularly to exchange ideas about the scientific
> capabilities and first observations to be carried out with the
> interferometer. A first world-wide conference on  "Science with the
> Atacama Large Millimeter Array" took place in Washington, D.C. (USA),
> on 6-8 October 1999.
>
> The conference to be held in Madrid (Spain), on 13-16 November 2006,
> will be the second world-wide meeting on "Science with the Atacama
> Large Millimeter Array". This international ALMA conference is
> envisioned as a way for the astronomers interested on ALMA, not
> necessarily radioastronomers, to exchange views, to plan preparatory
> observations in view of the scientific exploitation of the
> interferometer, and to obtain the information needed to orient their
> scientific work to the best possible use of ALMA.
>
> The conference will cover a wide range of topics (see scientific
> programme below), which will indeed include the main scientific
> drivers of ALMA:
>
>    The formation and evolution of galaxies.
>    The physics and chemistry of the interstellar medium.
>    The processes of star and planet formation.
>
> About 40 invited papers will be presented orally in morning and
> afternoon sessions, and there will be afternoon poster sessions. In
> addition we will also have around 20-35 short contributing papers.
> There will be no parallel sessions. Invited papers are of 30 minutes
> duration, including discussion. The proceedings will be published by
> Springer Verlag

Astronomy Colloquium
Institute of Astronomy, National Tsing Hua University
Time: 12:10pm, March 10, 2006
Place: Room 620, Phys Bldg, NTHU

Title:

Recent discoveries by RXTE satellite: observations and mechanisms on 
kHz QPOs, accretion-powered X-ray pulsars and black holes

Speaker:

Prof. Chengmin Zhang, 
National Astronomical Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences

Abstract:

 Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer satellite by NASA have shown many 
 discoveries in neutron star and black hole binary systems, and 
 kHz quasi-periodic oscillations (QPO), type-I X-ray busrts, 
 accretion-powered X-ray pulsars, as well as many low frequency 
 QPOs, have been detected, which may uncover the Einstein strong 
 gravity effect close to black hole horizon or on the surface of 
 neutron stars. RXTE observations have also found the hundred Hz 
 QPO from black holes, Galactic microquasar, and the 3:2 ratio 
 in pair QPOs arouses the mystry in understanding the accretion 
 flow around black holes. The recently proposed theoretical 
 mechanisms on QPOs are discussed and commented, which includes 
 beat model, prehelion precession, Lense-Thirring precession, 
 Alfven wave oscillation, etc., and finally we have a perspective 
 on the test of Einstein's general relativity in strong gravitational 
 field.

Subject: SMA proposals for Taiwan time

Dear Colleagues,

This is a reminder that the closing date and time for SMA 
(Submillimeter Array) proposals to ASIAA SMA TAC is March 10, 
2006, 5AM (not 5pm) CST in Taiwan (March 9, 2006, 11AM HST in 
Hawaii).  This call for proposals covers the observing period 
from May 1st to October 31st, 2006.  Those who are affilited 
to Taiwanese universities or Taiwanese research institutes 
are eligible to apply for the ASIAA SMA time as a principal 
investigator (PI).

All SMA proposals must be submitted through the SMA submission 
facility (https://sma1.sma.hawaii.edu/propose.html).  When you 
submit your proposal, please make sure to select "ASIAA" as 
your destination TAC in the submission web page.  Please submit 
your proposal early enough.  If you encounter any technical 
problem to use this facility, please contact Tatsuhiko Hasegawa 
(hasegawa@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw).

For technical information on the SMA, please see
     http://sma1.sma.hawaii.edu/proposing.html .
For Taiwan and ASIAA specific aspects (including the ASIAA 
proposal selection process and the amount of available 
observing time), please visit
     http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/~SMART/ . 
The SMA is a complex instrument.  Consultation or collaboration 
with those who are familiar with the SMA is highly recommended, 
and the contact points are also found in the above web pages.

Regards,

Tatsuhiko Hasegawa
SMA ASIAA TAC Chair
