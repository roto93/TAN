Dear Yi-Jehng,

Can you post this announcement on TAN?  Thanks.

Dear Colleagues,

It is our pleasure to announce the winter school on "Astrophysical Black
Holes" hosted by The Theoretical Institute for Advanced Research in
Astrophysics (TIARA).  It will take place on Jan 29 - Feb 2, 2007 on the
campus of National Tsing Hua University in Hsinchu, Taiwan.

TIARA was established in 2004 to provide an integrated world class program
of research and education in theoretical astrophysics and aims to coordinate
efforts of researchers and the training of future theoretical
astrophysicists throughout Taiwan and Asia. It serves as an international
center of excellence where forefront research can be intimately integrated
into the graduate education of Taiwan's universities and academic
institutions (see http://www.tiara.sinica.edu.tw for a general introduction
and a list of recent activities).
 
The aim of this winter school is to give an expository overview of black
holes and their roles in astrophysics.  The tentative lecture topics include
(but not limited to) fundamentals of General Relativity, black hole
spacetimes, gravitational collapse, accretion disks, relativistic
magnetohydrodynamics and other physical processes in strongly curved
spacetime, and gravitational radiation.  The confirmed lecturers are Patrick
Brady, Mike Cai, Paul Ho, Albert Kong, Joe Shields, Paul Wiita, Kinwah Wu,
and Hwei Jang Yo.  

As in previous years, TIARA will provide local support for up to 50 graduate
or advanced undergraduate students from within Taiwan and internationally.
Further information and online registration can be found at
https://www.tiara.sinica.edu.tw/activities/winterschool/2007/.

Best,

Mike Cai on behalf of the SOC
Mike J. Cai, Hsiang-Kuang Chang, Ronald Taam, and Hwei-Jang Yo.

> Subject: CosPA 2006 Int'l Symposium

Dear My Young Colleagues:
     
     The active researches in "experimental" Cosmology is just beginning 
(in less than ten years). This field, coupled with particle astrophysics 
on the one hand and string theory on the other, would occupy the scenario 
in the interrim of physics and astrophysics for decades to come.  

     The hotness of the subject is testified by the participation of the 
younger-generation colleagues from Japan and Korea (both about 10). I 
think that my young colleagues should not miss the boat - we, like those 
in the United States, should contribute to this important field of 
science.      

     I would like to extend my cordial invitation to you to attend the 
CosPA 2006 International Symposium (see the enclosure). If you would like 
to speak at the meeting, the slots become limited but you should try. The 
registration fee is $3,000NT (a half for students) is mainly for the 
published proceedings - including the banquet at the 101 building.  

     Of course, even the participation is limited.
  
                                  Best wishes, Pauchy

2006 International Symposium on Cosmology and Particle Astrophysics
    National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan
    November 15-17, 2006


                            FINAL ANNONCEMENT (as of September 15, 2006)

Dear Colleagues,
   As we human being venture into the 21st Century, it just so happens
uniquely that the human race is becoming capable of making use of their
hi-tech's to explore what is going on at the edge of our Universe or,
equivalently, what had happened much early on at the early universe, i.e.
shortly after the Big Bang. This has stiffened the competitions among
astronomers and particle physicists in their vigorous pursuits for the true
theory of cosmology, such pursuits being un-imaginable even a decade ago.
Here in Taiwan and especially at the Research Center for Cosmology and
Particle Astrophysics (CosPA Center), National Taiwan University, we wish to
actively join the crusade of the scientists worldwide in this pursuit of the
observation-based cosmology. The CosPA center will organize a series of
symposia, the one in question being the 2006 International Symposium on
Cosmology and Particle Astrophysics (CosPA2006), from November 15 to
November 17, 2006 in Taipei, Taiwan.
   The CosPA2006 is the third conference of this nature. In the past, we
successfully organized CosPA2002 and CosPA2003. The conferences provided a
very important forum for exchanging ideals and learn new techniques. We hope
to continue this important activity and hope that it would become an
important tradition. There will be invited review lectures, invited talks,
contributed talks, and poster presentations.
We are looking forward to seeing you.

Sincerely yours,
W-Y. Pauchy Hwang, National Taiwan University

Dear Colleagues,

ALMA-Taiwan team will hold the 3rd ALMA-Taiwan town meeting. All the people, 
who are interested in the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA)
Project, are invited to the meeting.

Date: October 21, 2006
Venue: the ASIAA, R916, Taipei
       (9th floor of the Condensed Matter Sciences and Physics
       Department Building, National Taiwan University)

ALMA is the largest ground based, international astronomical 
observational facility ever built, and is a partnership of North 
America, Europe, and Japan in cooperation with the Republic of Chile. 
It is currently under construction in the Chajnantor area in the 
Atacama desert in northern Chile. In September 2005, the Academia 
Sinica (AS) in Taiwan entered into an agreement with the National 
Institutes of Natural Sciences (NINS) in Japan in order to join the 
ALMA project through ALMA-Japan project. ALMA will be studying a broad 
range of exciting science, such as weather patterns on solar system 
planets, the formation of planets and stars in our galaxy, the motions 
within active galactic nuclei, and the formation of the earliest 
galaxies at z~10. You can find some
more information on the project at http://alma.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw.

The town meeting will start at 11:30 am at the R916 (ALMA-T Co-I's 
meeting will be held from 10:30 am at the same place). You can find 
maps at http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/about/map02a.htm.

At the meeting, we will mainly talk about:

- the latest status of the ALMA project, including the ALMA-T project
- the ALMA science cases, ALMA-T science sub-working groups
- the ALMA operation plan

If you are interested in attending the meeting, please send your 
registration form, attached below, to Linda Shao (lshao@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw) 
BY OCT 13. We will provide lunch boxes to people who request (see the 
registration form).  Even after the deadline, you can still send your registration 
form, but your lunch box may not be guaranteed. For more details of the 
meeting, send email to Nagayoshi Ohashi (ohashi@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw).

We look forward to seeing all of you at the meeting!

Cheers,
Nagayaoshi Ohashi
ALMA-Taiwan Project Manager
