Title: Surface Heterogeneity of 2005 UD from Photometric Observations

Abstract:
Recently discovered Apollo-type near-Earth asteroid 2005 UD is
suggested to be a fragment of (3200) Phaethon. In order to test this
hypothesis, we carried out photometric observations of 2005 UD using
1-m telescope at Lulin Observatory. Multi-color photometry was used
to compare the surface properties of (3200) Phaethon and 2005
UD. Surface color variation due to the rotation was also examined.
The time-resolved differential photometry showed clear brightness
variation, and the lightcurve was fitted with a rotation period of
5.23 hours and an amplitude of 0.44 mag. Using this rotational
lightcurve, we derived the surface colors of 2005 UD. The surface of
2005 UD exhibits colors similar to those of F- and B-type asteroids,
which is consistent with (3200) Phaethon. Furthermore, the (R-I) color
of 2005 UD shows variation during the rotation of the body. The
similarity of surface colors between (3200) Phaethon and 2005 UD
observationally supports the hypothesis that 2005 UD is likely a
fragment of (3200) Phaethon. A simple explanation for inhomogeneity of
the surface is that we see the surface and subsurface of the precursor
object. Another explanation is a the topographical structure such as a
large crater causes this heterogeneous surface.
