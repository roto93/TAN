                               Colloquium
                      at the Institute of Astronomy,
                       National Central University

Date: 10:00, 06/April/2006
Loc.: Room 1013, Science Building IV, National Central University
Speaker: Dr. Wong Tony (CSIRO, Australia)
Title: On the FIR-radio correlation in galaxies
Abstract:
The correlation between far-infrared and radio emission in galaxies is
one of the tightest, yet least understood, relations in star-forming
galaxies.  Because non-thermal synchrotron emission typically
dominates the radio continuum, a coupling between gas density and
magnetic field strength has been invoked to explain this correlation.
I discuss how spatially resolved observations of nearby disk galaxies
can be used to investigate this hypothesis.  In particular, I present
the results of a recent high-resolution study of the LMC.


Date: 11:00, 06/April/2006
Loc.: Room 1013, Science Building IV, National Central University
Speaker: Prof. Ogura Katsuo (Kokugakuin University, Japan)
Title: Star Formation in Bright-Rimmed Clouds
Abstract:
First we briefly overview the star formation phenomena in
bright-rimmed clouds (BRCs). Particular emphasis is laid on our works
which advocated the "Small-Scale Sequential Star Formation (SSSSF)
hypothesis." We then show the preliminary results of our photometric
studies on the aggregates of stars associated with BRCs in an attempt
to confirm the hypothesis. Finally a new hypothesis is presented on
the two modes of star formation associated with HII regions, i.e., the
"cluster mode" and the "dispersed mode." Presumably the density
distribution of the natal molecular cloud is the crucial factor behind
them.


Date: 14:00, 07/April/2006
Loc.: Room 1013, Science Building IV, National Central University
Speaker: Dr. Chen Huei-Ru (ASIAA, Taiwan)
Title: SMA 650 GHz observation toward G240.31+0.07
Abstract:
I will first introduce the Submillimeter Array (SMA) and then report
our SMA 650 GHz (460 micron) study toward an ultracompact (UC) HII
region, G240.31+0.07. Our observation resolved the dust continuum
emission into two clumps, with one clump coincident well with the
ultracompact HII region. the newly discovered dust clump is also
associated with water masers and may be a more recent star-forming
site. Properties and kinematics of the two clumps will be discussed as
well as a possible picture for this system.
