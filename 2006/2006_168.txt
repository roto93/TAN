Message to jlim@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw - PI of a recent CFHT proposal

Dear colleague,

Please take note that the 2007 CFHT Users' Meeting will take place on May 9 to
11 in Marseille, France. Details on the exact location will be communicated at
a later date.

The 2007 Users' Meeting will offer the opportunity to present and discuss a few
"hot topics" on three main themes:

- A review of the ongoing science
CFHTLS, wide-field astronomy with MegaCam and WIRCam, exciting results from the
first two years of ESPaDOnS, ...

- What to do once the CFHTLS is completed?
In the [2008-2010] period, the 100-night a year currently used by the CFHTLS
will be available to the CFHT communities for large programs on either (or all)
of the three main instruments CFHT will offer, for another Legacy Survey, or
for PI programs. What would you like to see happening?

- 2011 and beyond
The current "Golden Age Plan" calls for the CFHT Corporation to be in good
shape staff- and operation-wise by the end of 2010. What level of
accessibility to the observatory do the current CFHT communities want to
maintain beyond 2011, and with which instruments?

More information on these "hot topics", with possible answers to the questions
raised above, is available in the First Announcement of the meeting available
on the Users' Meeting 2007 web page at http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/UM2007/

In order to prepare this important meeting, a web/email based forum is set up
and accessible from the same web page.

Whichever way you wish for CFHT to evolve into, you will have to make it known
in order to make it happen. So, check the url, register and participate!

Thanks in advance for your involvement, which is going to be essential to draw
the future of your access to CFHT.

This message is sent to the communities via the CASCA, SF2A, IfA and ASIAA
mailing lists, to the PIs who submitted a proposal over the past semesters, and
to the CFHTLS users. It is also made public on the CFHT web site.

Aloha,
Christian
