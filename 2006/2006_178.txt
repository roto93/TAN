      ********************** First Announcement *************************

Star and Telescope XII, December 22, Friday, 2006 at NCU

The 12th Star and Telescope Workshop will be held on December 22
(Friday), 2006.  As usual, the workshop series provides an opportunity
for scientists and students to present their work on stellar research
or telescope-related studies.  In the past, issues such as
intrumentation design and national observatory were also covered.

The format this time should be the same as before, i.e., to start in
late morning (11 am) and end by mid-afternoon.  This allows all
participants to commute in one day and still have sufficient time to
interact with colleagues.  With so much going on in the related
fields on the island, we should have a lot to learn from each other.

Those who would like to present a talk, including graduate students,
please send me a title (wchen@astro.ncu.edu.tw).  We will come up with
a program as per the demand of time slots.

Wen Ping
