            INTERNATIONAL MAX PLANCK RESEARCH SCHOOL (IMPRS)
                   FOR RADIO AND INFRARED ASTRONOMY
                AT THE UNIVERSITIES OF BONN AND COLOGNE

                        PhD POSITIONS IN ASTRONOMY
                          Call for Applications

                    *** Deadline: March 15th, 2006 ***

 PLEASE DOWNLOAD AND POST IN YOUR INSTITUTION THE POSTER FOR THIS CALL FOR
    APPLICATIONS, FROM http://www.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de/imprs/Call_2006.pdf

The International Max Planck Research School (IMPRS) for Radio and
Infrared Astronomy at the Universities of Bonn and Cologne, funded by the
German Max Planck Society, invites applications for its doctoral program.
Located in Bonn and Cologne, Germany, the school offers a unique
environment for graduate students in astronomy due to the proximity of the
Max-Planck-Institut fr Radioastronomie (MPIfR), the Argelander Institute
for Astronomy of the University of Bonn (AIfA), and the I. Physikalisches
Institut at the University of Cologne.

IMPRS offers a competitive PhD program, including lectures, seminars, and
research projects supervised by scientists of the participating
institutions. Individual thesis committees monitor the progress of the
students. Successful completion of the IMPRS program will be honored with
an IMPRS certificate which supplements the doctoral degree (PhD). The
working language of the school is English.

PhD projects can be in both observational and theoretical astrophysics on
the following topics:

Structure and Kinematics of AGN Jets * Galactic Masers: Nature and
Application to Astrophysics * Intra-Day Variability * Infra-Red Interferometry
of Disks and Jets of Young Stars * Very-Long-Baseline Interferometry
Development * Interstellar Matter in Galaxies * Infra-Red interferometry of
AGN * Strong and Weak Gravitational Lensing * Galactic and Extragalactic
Magnetic Fields * High Precision Astrometry * Envelopes of Evolved Stars *
Radiative Transfer Modeling * Star Formation in the Milky Way and Other
Galaxies * Astroparticle Physics * Supermassive Binary Black Holes in AGN *
Observational Cosmology * Stellar Populations * Star Clusters * Satellite
Galaxies * Galactic Dynamics

Students have access to a wide range of ground- and space-based
observatories, including the unique 100-m radio telescope in Effelsberg
and world class instruments in sub-millimetre astronomy. The MPIfR is one
of the world centres for Very-Long-Baseline Interferometry, which uses a
global network of radio telescopes. This call for applications is open,
with closing date on March 15, 2006, for the program starting in autumn
2006. An earlier start is possible in exceptional cases. Applications for
the program are open to students from all countries. The applicants should
have a master's degree or diploma in physics, mathematics, or closely
related subjects. Candidates with a solid foundation in astrophysics will
be favoured in the selection process.
