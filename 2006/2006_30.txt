Dear Prof. Kuan,

Could you post following information to the TAN network?

Thank you in advance,

                               Colloquium
                      at the Institute of Astronomy,
                       National Central University

Date: 24 February 2006
Time: 14:00-15:00
Loc.: Room 1013, Science Building IV, National Central University

Speaker: Dr. MOTOYAMA Kazutaka (TIARA, Taiwan)

Title: Radiation driven implosion model for high accretion rate of protostar

Abstract:
We investigated how radiation driven implosion affects on star
formation nearby massive star. UV radiation from massive star ionizes
surface of molecular cloud and compress it. This process is known as
Radiation Driven Implosion(RDI). If RDI trigger star formation,
accretion rate and final mass of protostar would be affected by
RDI. Using numerical simulation, we revealed that RDI enhanced
accretion rate > 10^{-4} M_sun / yr. We also reveled that final mass
of protostar depends on density profile of cloud.

<<Subaru 2006B Call for Proposals>>

 Dear Colleague:

 - Please ignore this if you have already received a Japanese
 version of this message. We apologize for any duplicate mailings. -

This is to announce the opening of "The Call for Proposals for
Subaru Open Use semester S06B (from 2006 Aug. 1 to 2007 Jan. 31:
6 months)".  Detailed Information for observing time requests is
available at our website at:

http://www.naoj.org/Observing/Proposals/Submit/call.html

Please visit this website and read the description carefully
before submitting your proposals.

The deadline for Normal/Intensive Programs is

<<< March 14, 2006, 12:00am (Noon) in JST>>> [e.g., 3.00am in UT], 

while that for the Service program is one month later than this.

Especially important points specific to this S06B semester are 
summarized as follows; our web page should be consulted
for more detailed information.

[Telescope Down Time] 
Due to the re-coating work of the Primary mirror, the telescope 
will be shut down from the beginning to the middle of August, 2006.

[Time Exchange with Gemini]
Subaru users can apply to Gemini GMOS and NIFS in this S06B
semester. In this time exchange, Gemini observations will be 
performed in the queue mode and about 5 nights (50 hours) will 
be available.

[Opening of MOIRCS Spectroscopy Mode]
In addition to the imaging mode which is already opened 
since S06A, the low-resolution spectroscopic mode of MOIRCS 
is going to become available since this S06B semester, 
though with a shared-risk operation. 

Best regards,

 The Subaru Open Use Team


P.S.

This mail is sent to all the previous proposers/visitors
of Subaru telescope. The mailing list is used for
very special notice about Subaru telescope and
announcement for Open Use /Users Meeting.
