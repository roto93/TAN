Title: The light emission produced by using different ion species
       bombarding various mixed ices
Abstract:
In the interstellar medium and planets, water (the most abundant of
materials) and many other gases were formed into grains and dust. They
experienced constant irradiation by solar wind and radiation. In order
to simulate the above condition in the earth laboratory, several ion
species are applied to bombard several ices targets, which consist of
gases (for examples, CH[4] and NH[3]) mixed with iced water. The
optical spectroscopy of sputtered particles from the surface of mixed
ices has been measured. According to the P.  Sigmund's model [1], if
the projectiles with the same beam energy, then heavier ion will
generate more sputtered particles. It turned out that in this
measurement the heavier incident ion produced stronger light
intensity, which should be proportional to sputtered particles.
The optical emissions produce by ion species can be classified two
categories: (a) Light emissions of hydrogen molecular spectroscopy are
generated by hydrogen molecular ion species bombarding mixed ices with
water. (b) Light emissions of atomic transitions are produced by
projectiles of He^+, N^+, H[2] O^+, N[2]^+, and Ar^+.
The experiment of ion interaction with mixed ices can be used to
simulate conditions occurred in the astrophysics [2, 3].

Title: Fast identification of transits from light-curves in TAOS
Abstract:
I will present an algorithm that allows fast and efficient detection
of transits, including planetary transits, from light-curves. The
method is based on building an ensemble of fiducial models and
compressing the data. I will describe the method and demonstrate its
efficiency by finding planet-like transits in simulated TAOS
light-curves. We show that that our method is independent of the size
of the search space of transit parameters.
