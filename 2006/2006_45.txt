Dear all,

        We will have a colloquium talk this Friday presented by
  Dr. Parijat Thakur visiting from National Central University.
  Dr. Thakur is working on hydrodynamical simulations of galaxies
  and on Friday, he will share with us his research results with
  a talk titied "Formation of Symmetric Two-Armed Nuclear Spirals
  in Barred Galaxies".

        Please mark your calendar and remember to join!

  Regards,

  sheng-yuan

   Speaker : Dr. Parijat Thakur (National Central University)
   Title   : Formation of Symmetric Two-Armed Nuclear Spirals
             in Barred Galaxies
   Time    : 03/17 (Fri)  2:00 PM
   Location: Rm 716
   Abstract:
             We have performed smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH)
   simulations for the response of the gaseous disk to the imposed
   moderately strong non-axisymmetric bar potentials. We found that
   the symmetric two-armed nuclear spirals are formed by the hydrodynamic
   spiral shocks caused by the gravitational torque of the bar in the
   presence of a central SMBH that can remove the inner inner Lindblad
   resonance (IILR) when the sound speed of gas is high enough to drive
   a large amount of gas inflow deep inside the inner Lindblad resonance
   (ILR). With this result, we also argue that symmetric two-armed nuclear
   spiral may be an indicator of supermassive black hole (SMBH) in barred
   galaxies.
