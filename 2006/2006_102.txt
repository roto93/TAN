Title: Modelling the radiative transfer in aquatic environments
Abstract:
The quantitative study of the interactions of light with the aquatic
environment on earth, such as oceans, estuaries, lakes, rivers and
other water bodies, plays an essential role in hydrologic optics. For
a body of water with a constant index of refraction, the radiative
transfer equation (RTE) can be derived from more fundamental
equations, such as Maxwell's electromagnetic equation, quantum
mechanics and the Boltzmann equation. In the past two decades,
advances in radiative transfer theory have enabled a realistic
simulation of the underwater light field based on the numerical
approach. However, the computation requirement of these numerical
models is too high to apply in modelling the oceanic system. The
progress of modeling the oceanic system is impeded somewhat in that
while we know that error exists, and have the tool to correct the
error, we simply cannot afford to use that tool. As a result, we all
tolerate and live with error in simpler but faster models. This talk
summarizes a series of works conducted in the past eight years, with
the intention to develop a fast and accurate model of underwater
scalar irradiance for applications in modelling the oceanic
system. The same approach might be applicable to the realm of
astronomy to study the radiative transfer in stellar atmospheres.

Title: The Giant with 8 Eyes: latest news from the ESO Very Large
       Telescope Interferometer
Abstract: 
The ESO VLTI is arguably the most powerful optical interferometer
currently in operation. It is based on the four 8.2 meter telescopes
of the VLT, as well as four movable 1.8 meter telescopes of which
three are currently in operation. Equipped with two facility
instruments for the near- and mid-infrared which are available to the
international community, the VLTI can be used in visitor or service
mode in a user-friendly approach not dissimilar from any other
instrument offered by ESO.
I will give an overview of the current status of the VLTI and its
near-future developments, and present some of the main scientific
highlights which span subjects as diverse as stellar astrophysics,
AGNs, stellar physics and star formation.
