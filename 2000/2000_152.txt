In a series of workshops on Cosmology which had been Chinese -- German

Observatory from October 17 to 20, 2000. About six Japanese
participants are coming to join at this meeting. This workshop is also
the first such activity involving the newly established Partner group
of the MPI fuer Astrophysik at Shanghai Observatory. The topics to be
discussed include galaxy formation, large scale cosmic structure, high
redshift objects, the Cosmic Microwave Background, active galaxies and
quasars. 

Organizers
   Zugan Deng, Gerhard Boerner, Yipeng Jing (Secretary)

Sponsor:
   The workshop is supported by the exchange program between National
   Natural Science Foundation of China and Science Foundation of Germany,
   and the exchange program between Chinese Academy of Sciences and 
   Max-Planck Society. Shanghai Observatory will sponsor and host 
   the workshop.

Place: 
   Shanghai Astronomical Observatory, 
   80 Nandan Road, Shanghai, China

Time: 
   Arrival: Monday, October 16, 2000
   Workshop: Oct 17 (Tue) --- Oct 20 (Fri)
   Excursion: Oct 21/22 
   Departure: Oct 23 (Mon)

Workshop website: http://center.shao.ac.cn/cosmos4th/index.htm
   The website provides the updated information about the workshop. It
   also provides the information about the transportation from 
   two international airports in Shanghai to the hotel, the maps 
   around the hotel and the Shanghai Observatory, 
   some simple Chinese sentences (with English translation) which 
   can help you find way to, e.g. the hotel or the conference 
   place. AND MORE.

   Please be patient; the website is under construction and should
   be finished WITHIN this week (before 25th June 2000)
    
Preliminary list of the participants: see at the workshop website

Facilities for your presentation:
   The conference hall is well equipped by multi-media facilities. 
   You can use transparencies, slides and notebook PC (Power Point) 
   for your talk. Ordinary paper also works, as it can be directly
   projected. 

Registration:
    Although most of the participants have been invited to attend the
    workshop by the organizers, it is required that every
    participant make a registration (the form attached below)
    BEFORE 15 August 2000 for providing necessary information.
    The participants from Germany do not need to send the 
    registration again, since they have already provided 
    the information. There is no registration fee for the 
    participants from outside the Mainland China.

Social Events:
   There is a welcome party at 17:00 of 16 Oct in Shanghai
   Observatory. The workshop banquet will be held in the evening 
   of 19 Oct. On Oct.21/22, there will be an excursion to Putuo 
   Mountain Island. All the participants and accompanying persons are 
   invited to join. 

Proceedings:
   Proceedings will be published on "Progress in Astronomy" (Shanghai) for
   the invited talks, contributed talks, and poster presentations. 
   Language: English


Accommodations:
   According to our current plan (may subject to change; will be 
   confirmed in the second circular), the foreign participants will 
   live in XingLongHua Hotel which is three subway stops away from 
   Shanghai Observatory. The rate is estimated about 220 CNY (
   about US $28) per night for one two-bed room.
 
   The participants will have lunches and dinners together at 
   nearby restaurants with the meal cost covered by the workshop.

Transportation from airports to the hotel:
   The information can be found at the workshop website. We strongly
   encourage foreign guests to take flights in groups. If more than
   (including) five people arrive in Shanghai in one flight, we can
   arrange to pick them up at the airport. Individual guests (less than
   5) should come to the hotel by themselves.
