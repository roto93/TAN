********************************************************************************

GENERAL
  In celebration of 20 years of VLA observations, NRAO and New Mexico Tech 
  are jointly sponsoring a conference in Socorro, New Mexico, on
  21-24 May 2000.  The theme is the role of gas in galaxy evolution, 
  concentrating on the interplay between galaxies and their environments, 
  with some emphasis on HI imaging.  Questions we hope to address include:  
  What are the residual signatures of the formation process around galaxies?  
  Do galaxies evolve along the Hubble sequence?  If so, how, and in what 
  direction? Do mergers really convert spirals to ellipticals?  Can continuing 
  accretion `grow' dynamically-cold disks into the present?  What can we learn 
  about the history and fate of galaxies from the structure of their gaseous 
  envelopes?  We would like to confront the vast range of current observations 
  with theoretical predictions and interpretations, and to map out new 
  directions for the future.  The conference will conclude with a celebration 
  of the twentieth anniversary of the VLA, held at the VLA site. 

  A preliminary list of the major sessions is as follows:

     I. Gas Content as a Function of z, in the context of large scale structure

    II. Galaxy Formation and High-Redshift Galaxies

   III. Nearby Galaxies in (Trans)formation
   
    IV. Nearby Galaxies
       A. Stable long lived structures or continually evolving?
       B. Dark matter aspects of HI work  
          
     V. The Influence of Galaxies on Their Surroundings

    VI. Environmental Effects on the Gas in Galaxies

   VII. Outstanding Questions and Future Instruments

  VIII. Summary
