Subject: SIRTF Legacy Science Selections

Dear Friend of SIRTF:

The SIRTF Science Center (SSC) at the California Institute of Technology,
on behalf of 
NASA and the SIRTF Project Office at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
announces the 
selection of projects that will comprise the SIRTF Legacy Science Program.
Six 
investigations were chosen following a competitive scientific review held
at the SSC in 
October.  These projects will utilize 3160 hours of SIRTF observing time,
primarily in 
the first year of the mission, to conduct large and coherent science
investigations.  The 
processed data and post-pipeline data products from these projects will
create substantial 
databases that will be invaluable for archival research, and in planning
subsequent 
programs on SIRTF or on other space-borne, airborne, and ground-based
observatories.

The selected projects, listed in alphabetical order by the Principal
Investigator’s last 
name, are listed below.  Detailed abstracts and complete lists of
investigators will be 
posted online in December, after the teams revise their original abstracts
in response to 
modifications to their proposed investigation (as necessary).

Ed Churchwell (University of Wisconsin) and 13 Co-Investigators at 6
institutions
"The SIRTF Galactic Plane Survey"
(400 hours)
A 240 square degree IRAC survey of the inner Galactic plane, extending from
10 
to 70 degrees in longitude on either side of the Galactic Center, and from
-1 to +1 
degree in latitude.  The primary science goals include studying the
structure of the 
inner Galaxy and investigating the statistics and physics of star formation.

Mark Dickinson (Space Telescope Science Institute) and 38 Co-Investigators
at 13 institutions
"GOODS: Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey"
(647 hours)
A deep 300 square arcmin IRAC and MIPS (24-micron) survey that overlaps deep 
fields obtained by HST and CXO.  The primary science goals include the
study of 
galaxy formation and evolution over a wide range of redshift and cosmic 
lookback time.

Neal Evans II (University of Texas) and 10 Co-Investigators at 8 institutions
"From Molecular Clouds to Planets"
(400 hours)
Imaging surveys of nearby molecular clouds, with follow-up spectroscopy of 
young and embedded stellar sources.  The primary science include the study of 
the evolution of molecular cores into protostars and disks, the incidence
and early 
evolution of sub-stellar objects, and the spatial structure of groups and 
clusters.

Robert Kennicutt (University of Arizona) and 14 Co-Investigators at 7
institutions
"SINGS: The SIRTF Nearby Galaxies Survey -- Physics of the Star-Forming ISM 
and Galaxy Evolution" 
(512 hours)
A comprehensive imaging and spectroscopic survey of 75 nearby galaxies in 
order to characterize their large-scale infrared properties.  The primary
science 
goals are to understand the physical processes connecting star formation to
the 
ISM and to provide diagnostic templates for interpreting observations of
objects 
in the distant universe.

Carol Lonsdale (Infrared Processing and Analysis Center, Caltech) 
and 19 Co-Investigators at 9 institutions
"SWIRE: The SIRTF Wide-area Infrared Extragalactic Survey"
(851 hours)
Wide-area, high-latitude imaging surveys of up to 100 square degrees,
reaching to 
cosmological redshifts of ~2.5.  The primary science goals include the
evolution 
of dusty, star-forming galaxies, evolved stellar populations and AGN as a 
function of environment.  The resultant catalogs will include more than 2
million 
infrared-selected galaxies.

Michael Meyer (University of Arizona) and 18 Co-Investigators at 12
institutions
"The Formation and Evolution of Planetary Systems: Placing Our Solar System 
in Context"
(350 hours)
An imaging and spectroscopic survey of hundreds of young stars with accretion 
disks, ranging in age from a few million years to one billion years.  The
primary 
science goal is to trace the evolution of planetary systems from stellar
accretion 
through the coalescence of solids and accretion of remnant molecular gas,
and on 
through the planetary debris disk phase.


The Legacy Science TAC Chair, in formally recommending the projects to the
SSC Director, offered this statement:
"Taken together, the projects we recommend represent an exciting use of
NASA’s next major astrophysical observatory.  Each of the projects will
yield the superb science that we expect of a major investment of time in a
NASA Great Observatory.  A hallmark of each of these projects is that they
fully exploit the unique and special capabilities of SIRTF that make it a
major NASA mission and the highest priority space project of the 1991
National Academy of Sciences Decade Review."
