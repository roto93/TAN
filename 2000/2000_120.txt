Dear Colleagues,

This week we will have a big talk about the BOOMERANG results.

BOOMERANG is a microwave telescope, standing for "Balloon Observations Of 
Millimetric Extra-galactic RAdiatioN and Geomagnetics".  
The science magazine "Nature" has published this month a couple of papers
reporting and analyzing the exciting data from the BOOMERANG experiments.
It seems like that most of the mysteries of our universe can be solved  
by the data, and also it marks that now we enter a new era of precision
cosmology.

As I announced,  Professor Chiueh will give a review talk on the 
Boomerang results on May 11th at the Cospa Journal Club.
I STRONGLY encourage not only just COSPA members but also many other 
ASIAAn astronomers and TAIDA physicists (who are interested in the
universe at all) to attend the journal club meeting this week. 
It would be definitely far more efficient to hear one-hour talk than 
reading three papers in order to solve the mystery of the universe. 

See ya all this Thursday!

cheers, 
Jounghun Lee
