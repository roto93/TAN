Dear Colleagues and Students: This coming semeter, I will teach a course,
Special Topics in Particle-Astrophysics. It is aimed to introduce to
the students current topics in Cosmology and Particle phyiscs and 
get students to be familar with some of the topics studied under the
Taiwan Cospa project. The following is a list of the specific topics to be
discussed in the class. Would you please let interested students know
about this course?

The class times are:

2-4 Monday and 2-3 Friday (three hours a week)

Thank you for your attention.
