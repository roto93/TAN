 				FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT  
 		
                     		 16th March 2000  
 
 	The last astronomical meeting in which masers were the main 
 topic of discussion, ``Astrophysical Masers'', was held in March 1992 in 
 Virginia (Lecture Notes in Physics 412: Astrophysical Masers, 1993, Eds. 
 Clegg and Nedoluha and published by Springer-Verlag ).  During the past
 eight years there has been significant technological improvements in the 
 field of interferometry including the following:

    1) the coming of age of the VLBA, providing much improved imaging
       capabilities and temporal sampling for OH, water and other 
       molecular species;

    2) the operation of the VLBA and the upgrade of the VLA with 43 GHz 
       receivers which allows improved study of SiO masers;

    3) the MERLIN upgrade in frequency, resolution and sensitivity 
       providing intermediate spatial resolution between the VLA and VLBI; 

    4) the new JIVE correlator, facilitating many new observations with
       the European VLBI Network; 

    5) the dawn of Space-VLBI with the HALCA satellite providing the 
       highest possible resolution for OH maser observations; and

    6) the advances of mm-wavelength VLBI and telescopes at the BIMA, 
       OVRO, Nobeyama and IRAM facilities, to name a few. 
 
 These echnological improvements have provided higher quality maser data, 
 which in turn have led to important advancements in the understanding of 
 the various astrophysical phenomena with which masers are associated.  
 In particular, observations of H2O and OH masers in active galactic nuclei 
 (AGN) have provided dramatic confirmation of the existence of super-massive 
 black holes.

       On the theoretical front, there has also been significant
 progress on many aspects of maser theory.  Supercomputers have been
 used with refined molecular parameters, excitation conditions and optimized 
 code for radiative transfer in maser media.  There has been much
 progress on time variability and polarization theory.  We now have a 
 better understanding of the significance of heating sources, such as 
 X-rays from AGNs, in generating water masers and SiO masers in galactic 
 and extragalactic objects. 
 
 	We are organizing an IAU Symposium* to take place at the tropical 
 beach resort of Angra dos Reis, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, during March of 
 2001. The goals of the symposium are: 

      (1) to review the research done in cosmic masers since the 
 last conference, including the nature and implications of masers
 in each of their major astrophysical settings: star forming regions, 
 evolved star envelopes, and the nuclei of active galaxies.  

      (2) to present the current state of maser research in fields
 where masers serve as probes of physical and dynamical conditions.
 For example, masers allow one to measure distances directly, to
 determine magnetic field strengths and configurations, and to
 study the interstellar medium at both large and small scales.  

      (3) to discuss theoretical advances and challenges in maser physics
 and to promote better collaboration between observers and theoreticians.

      (4) to define important scientific targets for emerging telescopes
 such as the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) and the 50-m millimeter 
 radio telescope, both planned to be built in South America. 
 
 The members of the Scientific Organizing Committee are:
  
 Dr. Victor Migenes, U. Gto. (chair)  	 Dr. Mark Reid, CfA (co-chair) 
 Dr. Moshe Elitzur (UKy)                 Dr. Luis F. Rodriguez (UNAM) 
 Dr. Slava Slysh (ASC)                   Dr. Makoto Inoue (NAO) 
 Dr. Jim Cohen (UMan)                    Dr. Guido Garay (UChile) 
 Dr. Karl Menten (MPI)                   Dr. Ray Norris (ATNF)
 Dr. Zulema Abrahan (USP)
 
 The members of the Local Organizing Committee are: 
 
 Dr. Everton L\"udke, UFSM (chair)	Dr. Zulema Abraham (USP)
 Dr. Eugenio Scalise (INPE) 		Dr. Jacques Lepine (USP) 
 Dr. William Boas (CRAAE)		Dr. Marcio Maia (USP) 
 
 
       The registration fee will be US$160 per attendee (US$100 for 
 students) which will help defray the costs of a copy of the proceedings, 
 coach transportation to and from Angra dos Reis hotel and Rio de Janeiro 
 International airport, coffee breaks  and the conference dinner. 

       The preliminary registration form should be sent directly to the
 Local Organizing Committee Web page. We are accepting 15-min oral and
 poster titles and abstracts now. The SOC will select the abstracts for the 
 oral talks.
