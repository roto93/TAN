     following mailing address by February 29, 2000, with (i) copy of 
     submitted abstract; (ii) a resume with a brief description of 
     published work.  Preference of consideration will be given to junior

     Shatin, N.T., Hong Kong.)

  F. OCPA Subsidies:
     For OCPA members traveling from N. America, Europe and Taiwan, 
     because of their burden of overseas travel, OCPA will use part of its 
     resources to provide some local support for these members.  The exact 
     amount depends on the number of members requesting partial support 
     and OCPA resources.  OCPA members may email 
     ocpa2000@cmuhep2.phys.cmu.edu for update as the time nears.

  G. Conference Banquet will be held on Thursday evening at the Royal 
     Plaza Hotel in the Grand Century Place, a large shopping mall just 
     next to the Mongkok Train Station.  It will be a buffet dinner.  In 
     order to encourage accompanying spouses to join the banquet, a 
     discount price of HK$200 per person will be charged to them.

o ACCOMMODATIONS
 
  A. On-campus:
     (a) Air-conditioned student dormitory - about HK$130 per night per 
         person, double occupancy, with two single beds in each room, and 
         on each floor (with around 15 rooms) one big common bath room 
         with several separate showers. (Note that a number of places will 
         be reserved for holders of conference grants.) 
     (b) CU guest house -
         (i)  Chiang Building: 64 two-bed rooms, each sharing a bath with 
              another at the rate of about HK$390 per room per night.
         (ii) Kwan Tung Building: 30 two-bed rooms with private bath at an 
              estimate rate of $420 per room per night.
     The On-Campus Accommodation Reservation Form is attached at the end 
     of this announcement.  Because of limited number of places, 
     reservations will be handled on a first-come-first-served basis.  
     Please reserve early.  For further details, please contact Miss P. Y. 
     Ho (address: Department of Physics, The Chinese University of Hong 
     Kong, Shatin, N.T., Hong Kong; e-mail: pyho@phy.cuhk.edu.hk).

  B. Off-campus:
     Royal Park Hotel at Shatin is strongly recommended.  It is virtually 
     next-door to the New Town Plaza, one of the biggest shopping malls in 
     Hong Kong.  It takes only a couple minutes to walk to the Shatin 
     railway station, from there you can easily get to the Chinese 
     University and, in addition, get to almost anywhere in Hong Kong 
     through a southbound train and a connection to the MTR subways at 
     Kowloon Tong.  Moreover, there is a bus stop to take you to-and-fro 
     the new international airport in a luxurious bus at a rate of only 
     HK$20!  It is a 4-star hotel and we can enjoy the special rate of 
     HK$600 per night per room for two.  (The quoted rate excludes the 10% 
     service charge and the 3% tax.)  More information about the hotel can 
     be found in http://www.royalpark.com.hk and the booking form.  
     Booking must be made directly with the hotel.  Please contact Miss 
     P. Y. Ho to acquire the Accommodation Reservation Form.

o SIGHT-SEEING TOURS

  A. A half-day local tour in the afternoon of Wednesday has been arranged 
     with the China Travel Service (HK) Ltd.  Participants will be picked 
     up at Chinese University and Royal Park Hotel at around 2:00PM.  The 
     tour will visit the Tsing Ma Bridge viewing platform, Aberdeen and 
     Repulse Bay.  After a dinner at Wanchai, the tour will go to Victoria 
     Peak for a spectacular night view of the Pearl of the Orient.  
     Coaches will be arranged to carry participants back to the hotel and 
     the CU campus.
     This tour is exclusively for the conference participants and their 
     accompanying spouses.  Departure is based on 20 participants at the 
     least.  The tour price is US$45.00 per person.
 
  B. Other local sight-seeing tours for accompanying spouses may be 
     arranged with the local tourist agents.  A lot of information can be 
     found from the web-site of Hong Kong Tourist Association at 
     http://www.hkta.org.

  C. Three post-conference tours, one to Shenzhen for one day, the other 
     two to Beijing and Guilin, each for 4 days, have been arranged with 
     the China Travel Service (HK) Ltd.  One may choose to join the one-
     day trip to Shenzhen on August 5, and then the longer trip to either 
     of Beijing or Guilin.
     (a) One-day trip across border to Shenzhen on August 5: The tour will 
         visit the restored Old Dream City, a kindergarten and the local 
         free market.  After a lunch, the tour will visit China Folk
