4.  KECK/NIRSPEC TIME AVAILABLE TO U.S. COMMUNITY

Observing time on the Keck II Telescope with the Near-IR
Spectrograph is available to the U.S. community (and other
Gemini partners) through a trade of a Gemini InSb infrared 
array.  Three nights will be available in each of the 2000A, 
2000B, 2001A, and 2001B semesters; observations will be
carried out by Gemini Observatory staff.  NIRSPEC is a 
near-infrared (1-5 micron), cross-dispersed echelle and 
grating spectrometer with a 1024x1024 Aladdin InSb array 
detector capable of resolving powers of R~1500-3,000 
or R~15,000-75,000.  Further information on the instrument 
and on application procedures is available at

http://www.gemini.edu/sciops/instruments/nirspec/nirspecIndex.html

Applications are due 21 Feb 2000 for observations on 8 April 
and on 21 March 2000 for observations on 10-11 May.
