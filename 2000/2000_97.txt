  2nd Announcement of the 6th Taipei Astrophysics Workshop (TAW6)

  The Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy & Astrophysics, National
  Central University, National Cheng Kung University, National Taiwan
  University, National Taiwan Normal University, and National Tsing Hua 
  University plan to have a workshop in Taiwan on 16-19 May, 2000, with
  the theme

   "PROSPECTS IN ASTRONOMY AND ASTROPHYSICS IN THE NEW MILLENNIUM"

  The purpose of this workshop is to bring together a small group of
  approximately 50 young researchers who are doing exciting work in
  observational and theoretical astrophysics.  By congregating researchers
  who share a common cultural and professional background, we hope that
  this workshop will foster scientific collaboration, future interaction,
  and better awareness of the development of astronomy in the 
  international Chinese community.

  We are soliciting participants from all over the world.  The subject
  matter has been left deliberately broad --- Galactic and extragalactic
  observations, cosmology, theoretical astrophysics, and ground-based as
  well as space-borne astronomical instrumentation.  The format of this
  workshop will consist of 15-min talks followed by 5-min discussions, 
  plus ample free time for interaction and outdoor activities.

  The meeting will be held at the Academia Sinica in Taipei on May 16, and
  at the Grand Formosa Taroko in Tien Hsien on May 17-19.  Tien Hsien is
  located in the Taroko Gorge National Park, one of the most beautiful 
  spots in eastern Taiwan.

  Accommodations (except for students) will be in the form of shared 
  double-occupancy rooms at the Howard Plaza Taipei on the nights of May
  15-16, at the Grand Formosa Taroko on May 17-18, and the Howard Plaza 
  Taipei again on May 19.  Full accommodation expenses will be provided
  for invited participants only (please see the list below).  For local
  professional astronomers, expenses will be provided only for
  accommodations at Tien Hsien.  Requests for your own double room or 
  a single room can be made in the registration form, but with the extra 
  cost at your own expense.  Requests also can be made for accommodations 
  beyond these dates at the participant's expense.  More information on a
  ccommodations can be found  below and in the workshop WEB site.

  All interested participants should register by April 9, 2000.  Local 
  undergraduate and graduate students with strong interests in astronomy
  are especially encouraged to attend, and to apply for full financial
  support by arranging a letter of recommendation to 
  emily@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw by April 16, 2000.  For students, 
  accommodations will be in the form of a shared 4-person Japanese room at
  the Grand Formosa Taroko.  All students are encouraged to find their own 
  accommodations in Taipei, although we will arrange accommodations if needed.
 
  Additional details about the meeting, including information on the SOC,
  the LOC, instructions on how to get from the CKS International Airport
  to the Howard Plaza Taipei, instructions on how to get from the Howard
  Plaza Taipei to the Academia Sinica, a map of the Academia Sinica, a
  preliminary program, details about accommodations, and a list of
  invited participants can be found below and in the workshop WEB site at
