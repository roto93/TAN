Dear Colleagues:

	We cordially invite you to participate in TAW7 on 
"Cosmic Rays in the Universe" at National Central University, 
Chung-Li, Taiwan.

	The workshop is meant to bring together scientists 
interested in both particle physics and astrophysics to review 
and discuss the physics of cosmic rays including neutrinos and 
gamma rays.  Hopefully this conference can promote cosmic rays/particle 
astrophysics research in Taiwan and the Far East.  

        Most of the presentations are overviews of cosmic rays in 
the universe and interrelation between particle physics and 

astrophysics.  
We also solicit oral and poster contributions.

	Topics are roughly divided into three parts:  
	- high and very high energy cosmic rays, 
	- neutrinos and gamma rays, and 
	- cosmic ray propagation and acceleration.

	For further information (e.g., registration, etc.) please
