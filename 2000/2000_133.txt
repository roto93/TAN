Based on our high resolution, two-dimensional hydrodynamical
simulations, we propose that large cavities may be formed by 
the nonlinear development of the combined thermal and gravitational 
instabilities, without need for stellar energy injection in a galaxy 
modeling the Large Magellanic Clouds (LMC).
Our numerical model of the star formation allows us to 
follow the evolution of the blastwaves due to supernovae in 
the inhomogeneous, multi-phase, and turbulent-like media self-consistently.
Formation of kpc-scale inhomogeneity, such as cavities, observed H\,{\sc i} 
map of the LMC, is suppressed by frequent supernovae (average supernova 
rate for the whole disk is $\sim 0.001$ yr$^{-1}$). However the supernova 
explosions are necessary for the hot component ($T_g > 10^{6-7}$ K).
Position-velocity maps show that kpc-scale shells/arcs formed 
through the nonlinear evolution in a model without stellar 
energy feedback has similar kinematics to explosional phenomena, such as
supernovae.
We also find that dense clumps and filamentary structure are 
formed due to a natural consequence of the non-linear evolution of the
multi-phase ISM. Although the ISM in a small scale looks turbulent-like and
transient, the global structure of the ISM is quasi-stable. In the quasi-stable
phase, the volume filling factor of the hot, warm, cold components are
$\sim 0.2, \sim 0.6$, and  $\sim 0.2$, respectively.
We compare the observations of H\,{\sc i} and molecular gas of the 
LMC with the numerically obtained H\,{\sc i} and CO brightness temperature 
distribution.  The morphology and statistical properties 
of the numerical H\,{\sc i} and CO maps are discussed.
We find that the cloud mass spectrum of our models
represent a power-law shape, but their slopes change between models with 
and without the stellar energy injection, and also the slope depends on the
threshold brightness temperature of CO.

{\Large\bf  Interpretation of the Spatial Power Spectra of Neutral Hydrogen
\\ \medskip  in the Galaxy and in the Small Magellanic Cloud

Recent 21 cm radio observations of H\,{\sc i} regions in the Small  
Magellanic Cloud have revealed   spatial power spectra of the intensity, 
which are quite similar in shape to those previously deduced for
the Galaxy.
The similarity, in spite the differences in the physical parameters
between the Galaxy and the SMC, suggests that 
the shape of the power spectra reflects some underlying mechanism
which is not too sensitive to the   environmental specifics.
In this paper we present  an interpretation for the observational power 
spectra  in terms of a large scale turbulence in the interstellar medium, 
in which the emitting H\,{\sc i} regions are embedded. The turbulence
gives rise to density fluctuations which lead to the observed  
intensity fluctuations, in the H\,{\sc i} regions.
The observational power spectra are  used to deduce  the turbulence
spectral function. 

 In the SMC, the turbulence largest eddies are comparable in scale to
the SMC itself. This implies that turbulent mixing should have
smoothed out 
any large scale abundance gradients. Indeed, this seems to be the case,
observationally. 

The turbulence is also expected to amplify and shape up the large scale 
magnetic field.
Indeed, the observational data indicate the existence of a large 
scale disordered field of the strength expected from energy
equilibrium with the turbulent  velocity field.
The large scale turbulence is most probably generated by instabilities in 
 the large scale  flows induced by the
tidal close encounter with the LMC $ \sim 2\times 10^8{\rm yr}$ ago.
The life-time of the largest eddies is
$\sim 4\times 10^8{\rm yr}$ so the turbulence had not yet enough time
to decay and persists even though the energy source is no longer there.

More than 20 years after the {\it Copernicus} satellite,
{\it ORFEUS} allows the investigation of molecular
hydrogen (H$_2$) in the diffuse interstellar medium by way of FUV
absorption spectroscopy once again.  This time,
targets in the Magellanic Clouds were also observed,
allowing the first investigation of cold H$_2$ in a metal-poor
environment outside the Milky Way disk.
This paper presents new H$_2$ measurements in LMC gas
along the lines of sight toward HD\,269698 (Sk\,$-$67\,166),
HD\,269546 (Sk\,$-$68\,82) and HD\,36402 (Sk\,$-$67\,104)
and summarizes the {\it ORFEUS} H$_2$ measurements in the
the Magellanic Clouds.
For seven lines of sight we investigate correlations between
$N($H\,{\sc i}$)$, $N($H$_{2})$, $E(B-V)$ and compare the
results with H$_2$ observations in the Milky Way disk.
We find that the abundance of H$_2$ is low in comparison to the 
total gas quantity and speculate that the
fraction of hydrogen in molecular form is
limited by the lower dust content of the
Magellanic Clouds.

We present new observations of the major star--forming
region N\,66 in the Small Magellanic Cloud and of its surroundings, which
add to those presented in Contursi et al.\ 2000
(Contursi A., Lequeux J., Cesarsky D. et al. 2000, A\&A, submitted, Paper I).
High--sensitivity CO observations allowed the detection of molecular gas
associated with the H\,{\sc ii} region, for which a high--resolution image in
[O\,{\sc iii}] $\lambda$ 5007 is presented. We also present images in the 
v(1-0) S(1) line of H$_2$ at 2.12 $\mu$m and in the adjacent continuum. This
material reveals an interesting photodissociation region. We show that the
molecular gas that has not yet been photodissociated by the UV radiation
of the stars is in hot, dense clumps with a very small surface filling
factor. We discovered several embedded stars or stellar associations,
and suggest that
three successive stellar generations have already taken place in less than
3 million years.

We present the discovery of several new regions of interaction between
the ejecta and equatorial circumstellar ring of SN1987A, an interaction
leading to a much expanded development of the supernova remnant.
We also trace the development of the first such ``hot spot,''
discovered in 1997, back to 1995. Later hot spots seem to have emerged
by early 1999.  We discuss mechanisms for the long delay between
the first and later spots.

We report a {\it Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer} satellite
observation of the supernova remnant N49 in the
Large Magellanic Cloud, covering the 905 -- 1187 \AA\ spectral region. A
$30''$ square aperture was used, resulting in a velocity resolution
of $\sim$100 $\rm km ~ s^{-1}$.  The purpose of the observation was
to examine several bright emission lines expected
from earlier work and to demonstrate
diffuse source sensitivity by searching for faint lines never seen
previously in extragalactic supernova remnant UV spectra.  Both
goals were accomplished.
Strong emission lines of O\,{\sc vi} $\lambda\lambda$1031.9, 1037.6 and
C\,{\sc iii} $\lambda$977.0 were seen, Doppler broadened to $\rm \pm 225 ~
km ~ s^{-1}$ and with centroids red-shifted to 350 $\rm km ~ s^{-1}$,
consistent with the LMC.  Superimposed on the emission lines are
absorptions by C\,{\sc iii} and O\,{\sc vi}
$\lambda$1031.9 at +260 $\rm km ~ s^{-1}$, which are attributed to warm
and hot gas (respectively) in the LMC.  The O\,{\sc vi} $\lambda$1037.6 line
is more severely affected by overlying interstellar and $\rm H_2$
absorption from both the LMC and our galaxy.  N\,{\sc iii} $\lambda$989.8 is not
seen, but models indicate overlying absorption severely attenuates this line.
A number of faint lines from hot gas have also been detected,
many of which have never been seen in an extragalactic supernova
remnant spectrum.

                      We present an analysis of wind line profiles
from  {\it FUSE} spectra of two O7 supergiants in the Large and Small
Magellanic
Clouds (Sk~$-67^{\circ}$111 and AV 232 respectively). Model fits yield
the column densities of S\,{\sc iv}, S\,{\sc vi},
P\,{\sc iv}, P\,{\sc v}, N\,{\sc iii}, and N\,{\sc iv}, providing the
first direct measurement of the ionization balance in stellar winds.
The ratios  of S\,{\sc iv}/S\,{\sc vi} and P\,{\sc iv}/P\,{\sc v} are
consistently lower  in the LMC star.
{\it IUE} and {\it HST} archival spectra are also used to measure 
N\,{\sc iv} and N\,{\sc v},
but the much higher optical depth makes the N\,{\sc v} measurements
inconclusive. The velocity and optical depth distributions in the wind
are qualitatively similar between the two stars, when scaled to their
terminal velocities. The terminal velocities are different, with AV 232
being lower (as found previously in
SMC stars and linked to lower metallicity). These are the first results from a
program to investigate wind ionisation and velocity structure among hot
stars in local galaxies, and demonstrate the higher accuracy
in measuring column densities of less abundant ions such
as phosphorus and sulfur, observable in the {\it FUSE} range.\\

We compare the stellar wind features in far-UV spectra of 
Sk~$-67\mbox{$^\circ$}111$, an
{O7 Ib(f)} star in the LMC, with Sk\,80, an {O7 Iaf$+$} star in the SMC.
The most striking differences are that Sk\,80 has a substantially
lower terminal velocity, much weaker {O~{\sc vi}} absorption, and stronger
{S~{\sc iv}} emission.
We have used line-blanketed, hydrodynamic, non-LTE atmospheric models
to explore the origin of these differences.
The far-UV spectra require systematically lower stellar
temperatures than previous determinations for O7 supergiants derived
from plane-parallel, hydrostatic models of photospheric line profiles.
At these temperatures, the {O~{\sc vi}} in Sk~$-67\mbox{$^\circ$}111$ must 
be due primarily to shocks in the wind. \\

We present {\it Far-Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE)} spectroscopy
of Sand~2, a LMC WO-type Wolf-Rayet star, revealing the
O\,{\sc vi} resonance P~Cygni doublet at 1032--38\AA.
These data are combined with {\it HST}/FOS ultraviolet and Mt Stromlo 2.3m
optical spectroscopy, and analysed using a spherical,
non-LTE, line-blanketed code. Our study reveals exceptional stellar 
parameters: $T_{\ast}\sim$150,000K, $v_{\infty}$=4100 km\,s$^{-1}$,
log\,($L/L_{\odot})$=5.3, and
$\dot{M}=1\times 10^{-5} M_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$,
if we adopt a volume filling factor of 10\%. Elemental abundances of
C/He$\sim0.7\pm0.2$ and O/He$\sim0.15_{-0.05}^{+0.10}$ by number 
qualitatively support previous recombination line studies. We confirm 
that Sand~2 is more chemically enriched in carbon than LMC WC stars,
and is expected to undergo a supernova explosion within the 
next 5$\times 10^{4}$yr.

We present {\it HST} spectroscopy and imaging, along with new ground-based 
spectroscopy and {\it ROSAT} HRI imaging, of the He\,{\sc ii} emitting 
nebula N44C 
and its ionizing star. A GHRS spectrum of the ionizing star yields a spectral
type of about O7 for the star. The lack of P Cygni profiles for Si\,{\sc iv}
and C\,{\sc iv} 
indicates that the star is not a supergiant. The nebular abundances in the 
ionized gas are consistent with average abundances for LMC H\,{\sc ii} 
regions, with 
the possible exception that nitrogen may be enhanced. Enrichment by a former
evolved companion star is not evident. A long-slit echelle spectrogram in 
H$\alpha$ + [N\,{\sc ii}] shows no evidence for high-velocity gas in N44C. This 
rules out high-velocity shocks as the source of the nebular He\,{\sc ii} 
emission.
A 108 ks ROSAT HRI image of N44C shows no X-ray point source to a 3$\sigma$
upper limit $L_X$ $<$ 10$^{34}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in the 0.1-2.0 keV band. Based
on new measurements of the electron density in the He\,{\sc ii} emitting 
region, we 
derive recombination timescales of $\approx$ 20 yrs for He$^{+2}$ and $\approx$ 
4 yrs for Ne$^{+4}$. If N44C is a fossil X-ray ionized nebula, this places 
severe constraints on when the putative X-ray source could have turned off. 
The presence of strong [Ne\,{\sc iv}] emission in the nebula is puzzling if 
the ionizing source has turned off. It is possible the system is related to
the Be X-ray binaries, although the O star in N44C does not show Be 
characteristics at the present time. Monitoring of X-rays and He\,{\sc ii} 
emission
from the nebula, as well as a radial velocity study of the ionizing star, 
are needed to fully understand the emission line spectrum of N44C.

A correlation of X-ray source and Halpha emission-line object
catalogues in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) shows that more
than two thirds of the optically identified Be stars in Be/X-ray
binaries are found as emission-line objects in the catalogues. On
the basis of this result we propose up to 25 X-ray
sources mainly from recent ROSAT catalogues as new Be/X-ray binaries
and give their likely optical counterparts. Also for the five yet
unidentified X-ray pulsars in the SMC we propose emission-line stars
as counterparts. This more than doubles the number of known
high mass X-ray binary systems in this nearby galaxy. The spatial
distribution of the new candidates is similar to that of the already
identified Be/X-ray binaries with a strong concentration along the SMC
main body and some systems in the eastern wing. The new candidates
contribute mainly to the low-luminosity end of the X-ray luminosity
distribution of Be/X-ray binaries. A comparison with the luminosity
distribution in the Milky Way reveals no significant differences
at the high-luminosity end and the large number of low-luminosity systems
in the SMC suggests that many such systems may still be undetected
in the Galaxy.
The overall ratio of known Be to OB supergiant X-ray binaries in the SMC is
an order of magnitude larger than in the Galaxy, however, might show
spatial variations. While in the eastern wing the ratio is comparable
to that in the Galaxy no supergiant X-ray binary is currently known in
the main body of the SMC. Possible explanations include a different
star formation history over the last ~15 My.

LMC 1991 was a very fast, classical nova and the brightest nova ever
observed in the Large Magellanic Cloud. It was extensively observed during
both its early optically thick and its nebular evolution in the optical and
UV wavelength regions. We have successfully fit all the optically thick
spectra using a grid of spherically symmetric, non-LTE, line-blanketed,
expanding synthetic spectra created with the model atmosphere code {\tt
PHOENIX}. The emission lines of the nebular spectra have been fit using an
optimization technique for the emission line luminosities predicted by the
photoionization code {\tt CLOUDY}. Our analyses show the following: the
bolometric luminosity was super-Eddington before visual maximum and reached
L$^{max}_{Bol} \sim$ 6$\times$10$^{5}$ L$_{\odot}$, the ejected mass was
$\sim$ 3$\times$10$^{-4}$M$_{\odot}$, and nuclear burning on the white
dwarf ceased after $\sim$ 100 days. The elemental abundances (by number)
with respect to solar of the ejecta were: He/H = 0.8$\pm$0.2, C/H =
5$^{+2.5}_{-2}$, N/H = 85$^{+22}_{-17}$, O/H = 6.5$^{+2.5}_{-1.5}$, and all
other elements $\sim$ 0.1. These abundances were determined from both the
optically thick and nebular analyses. The extreme luminosity, high ejected
mass, rapid turn off time, and low metallicity (except for enhanced CNO)
represent the extreme values of observational nova parameters and thus
present interesting challenges for understanding the nature of the outburst
of LMC 1991.

More than 1300 variables classified provisionally as first overtone 
RR Lyrae pulsators in the {\sc macho} variable star database of the Large 
Magellanic Cloud (LMC) have been subjected to standard frequency analysis. 
Based on the remnant power in the prewhitened spectra, we found 70\% 
of the total population to be monoperiodic. The remaining 30\% (411 stars) 
are classified as one of 9 types according to their frequency spectra. 
Several types of RR Lyrae pulsational behavior are clearly identified 
here for the first time. Together with the earlier discovered 
double-mode (fundamental \& first overtone) variables this study 
increased the number of the known double-mode stars in the LMC to 181. 
During the total 6.5 yr time span of the data, 10\% of the stars showed  
strong period changes. We also discovered two additional types of 
multifrequency pulsators with low occurrence rates of 2\% for each. 
In the first type there remains one closely spaced component after 
prewhitening by the main pulsation frequency. In the second type the 
number of remnant components is two, they are also closely spaced, and, 
in addition, they are symmetric in their frequency spacing relative to 
the central component. This latter type of variables is associated with 
their relatives among the fundamental pulsators, known as Blazhko 
variables. Their high frequency ($\approx 20\%$) among the fundamental 
mode variables versus the low occurrence rate of their first overtone 
counterparts makes it more difficult to explain Blazhko phenomenon by 
any theory depending mainly on the role of aspect angle or magnetic 
field. Current theoretical models invoke nonradial pulsation components 
in these stars.

 We suggest a new component of the Milky Way that can account for both
the optical depth and the event durations implied by microlensing searches
targeting the Large Magellanic Cloud.  This component, which 
represents less than
$4\%$ of the total dark matter halo mass, consists of mainly
old white dwarf stars in a distribution that extends
beyond the thin and thick disks, but lies well within the dark matter halo. 
It is consistent with 
recent evidence for a significant population of faint white dwarfs detected
in a proper motion study of the Hubble Deep Field
that cannot be accounted for by stars in the disk or spheroid.
Further, it evades all of the current observational constraints that 
restrict a halo population of white dwarfs.

The evolution of the observational results of microlensing towards the
LMC and some of the suggested interpretations to account for them are
discussed. It is emphasized that the results at present are indicative of
a lensing population of white dwarfs, possibly in the spheroid (not
dark halo) of the Galaxy, together with the more standard backgrounds
of stellar populations in the Magellanic Clouds and in the
Galaxy. This is also hinted by dynamical estimates of the spheroid
mass and by recent direct searches of old white dwarfs.

The star formation histories of Local Group galaxies are summarized. The 
three large spirals are discussed individually, whereas the discussion of 
the Local Group dwarfs concentrates on differences and commonalities. 
While Local Group galaxies exhibit an amazing diversity in their star 
formation and enrichment histories even within the same morphological 
type, they share a number of common global properties. Major determining 
factors for their evolution are galaxy mass and environmental effects such as
ram pressure and tidal stripping. It seems likely that low-mass dwarf 
irregular galaxies evolve into dwarf spheroidals.
