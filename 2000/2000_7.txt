1.  CHANDRA AND HALE-BOPP SESSIONS WEBCAST LIVE 
    FROM ATLANTA

In the first experiment at live webcasting from an AAS 
national meeting, two events from Atlanta will be carried 
live on the World Wide Web:
 
First Results from the Chandra X-ray Observatory
2:00-3:30 p.m. EST, Friday, January 14.
This session features talks by Martin Weisskopf (MSFC),
Leon P. Van Speybroeck (CFA), Gordon P. Garmire (Penn State),
Stephen S. Murray (CFA), Albert C. Brinkman (SRON), and
Claude Canizares (MIT) on the findings from the newest of
the orbiting "Great Observatories."
 
The Importance of Comet Hale-Bopp: An Astronomical
Perspective
8:30-9:20 a.m. EST, Saturday, January 15.
This invited talk will be presented by Lucy-Ann McFadden
(Univ. Maryland), who writes "Comet Hale-Bopp is repeatedly
recounted in numerous scientific papers as the comet of the
century."

The webcasts are sponsored by NASA.  
 
You can watch these webcasts at

In order to view the webcasts you will need to have 
RealPlayer G2 loaded on your computer.  This is freely 
available to download at http://www.real.com/

3.  NSF BIOCOMPLEXITY SPECIAL COMPETITION 2000 
    James L. Rosenberger, mailto:jrosenbe@nsf.gov

The announcement for the Biocomplexity program can be found
on-line at:

http://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/getpub?nsf0022
 
This is an exciting opportunity for mathematical and
physical scientists of all types to engage in multidisciplinary,
frontier science.  All proposing groups must be multidisciplinary
and include a quantitative expert, mathematician or
statistician.  Quoting from the announcement: "The research 
plan must begin with a section that presents the conceptual, 
mathematical or computational model that frames the research 
activities and describes how the proposed work can lead to 
achieving a predictive level Of understanding of the system under
study."
 
This $50 million program will support both Research
Projects up to $600,000 per year for 5 years, and smaller 
Incubation Activities up to $100,000 total.
 
Letters of Intent are due 31 January 2000 for Research 
proposals.  Full proposals are due 1 March 2000 for both 
Research and Incubation Activities.
