Postdoctoral Scholar in Cosmochemistry Research.

First Published 02/22/00 


The Division of Geological and Planetary Sciences at California
Institute of Technology seeks

applicants for postdoctoral scholar positions in cosmochemistry
starting April 2000. The research

will focus on the study of extraterrestrial materials for the purpose
of understanding the stellar and

astrophysical processes that provide dust to the interstellar medium
and the processes involved in

the formation and evolution of the early solar system and the
terrestrial planets. This is an active

area of multidisciplinary research, which involves isotopic, chemical,
mineralogical, and nuclear

astrophysical approaches. The laboratories are equipped with excellent
high-sensitivity thermal

ionization mass spectrometers, an ion probe, automated SEM, and ultra
clean laboratories for

chemical analyses and sample handling. 


Applicants are sought with a background in cosmochemistry,
astrophysics, and/or geochemistry.

 A combination of planetary and terrestrial work is feasible. Talented
individuals who are interested

in these research programs with degrees in chemistry, physics,
astronomy, or meteoritics are

encouraged to apply.


Completion of the Ph.D. is required.

Initial appointment is for 1 year, renewable for a second year
contingent upon good progress.

Salary is dependent on experience in the field.


A resume and the names of three references should be sent to Professor
G. J. Wasserburg,

Lunatic Asylum, Division of Geological and Planetary Sciences,
MS170-25, California Institute

of Technology, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA. 


California Institute of Technology is an equal opportunity employer.
Women, minorities,

veterans, and disabled persons are encouraged to apply.
