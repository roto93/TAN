Dear all, here is another interesting email on 12m closure. All 3

Subject: 12m Closure (II)


TO THE 12 M USER COMMUNITY:

The community should be aware of what is going on with the 12 m 
and its proposed shut-down in 4 months. The plans to close the 12 m 
were kept secret from the community. Neither the NRAO Visiting
Commitee nor the NRAO Program Advisory Committee had  knowledge that
this shut down was to occur on such a disasterously short timescale.
The action came as a total surprise and leaves many programs in
total limbo. Yet, the Director of NRAO says its a "done deal", at
least that is what he wants you to think. Now is the time to let
him know otherwise.

The claim is that there is not enough money to run the 12m. Yet, the
NRAO budget is $32.5 M plus $4.2 M in MRI+REU+EHR+IR, and $8M for ALMA
design/development. The cost of running the 12 m is estimated to be less
than $2M, as compared to the total NRAO budget of $42.7 M.  Is closing a 
telescope with a very strong user community ( > 170 users) for such a small
saving really the only option available to NRAO ? And would it not be better
to discuss the matter openly to arrive at a rational solution for our
national observatory?

Clearly there must be some explanation for this strange action. Some insight
is provided by the attached viewgraphs selected from a presentation given by 
Dr.Bob Dickman of the NSF Astronomy Division. These were presented in early
Dec. 1999,i.e. about 3 months ago, at the Portfolio Allocation Review 
meeting at the National Science Foundation, as shown in the first viewgraph.
The second indicates Dickman's view of the 12m - he describes it as an
"obsolescent facility". Where does this opinion come from? Was the community
that uses the 12 m ever asked for its advice ? Was there discussion and/or
a committee to discuss closing the 12 m before this quick, secretive move
was made ? The purpose of NRAO is to serve the community. Is NRAO fulfilling
its role by closing this well-used and needed telescope on 4 MONTHS NOTICE,
WITHOUT PRIOR DISCUSSION. We must also ask who benefits from the closure of the 
12m and inquire what NRAO considers important.

Apparently one thing is expanding the Charlottesville headquarters at all costs
(see attachment 3) although we suspect that a careful examination would
demonstrate that it contributes only a small proportion of NRAO's service
functions. According to Dickman, proximity to Dulles Airport is critical
to ALMA and therefore a determining factor!!!. Another is the new glossy
NRAO newsletter (no attachment). As for the service role, did you know
that the biggest users of the VLA are the NRAO staff ? Were you aware that
the VLBA sits unused a large fraction of the time (just look at their
schedules...) ? And how much money is being spent on AIPS ++ ? Something
is surely wrong with the priorities here.

If it values continued access to the 12m until something else is available, the
mm-wave community must fight back to stop the closure until alternatives are in
place.  We must also demand that a proper examination of NRAO's role and
priorities be undertaken. The success of ALMA as a user facility (rather 
than a toy of the NRAO staff) depends on a healthy mm-wave community and 
that in turn depends to a considerable extent on the 12m.

Please call and/or e-mail the people listed below ASAP. One e-mail,
with copies to the others would suffice. This is NOT a done deal so
don't let arbitrary actions by an out-of-touch management ruin your
career,  those of your students and the prospects for ALMA.
