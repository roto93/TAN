		Arizona Prize Postdoctoral
	Fellowship in Theoretical Astrophysics

The University of Arizona has recently established the Arizona Prize
Postdoctoral Fellowship as part of its Program in Theoretical
Astrophysics. Awarded to a single individual for a period of three
years, the postdoctoral fellowship recognizes outstanding potential in
original scientific research in the area of Theoretical Astrophysics.
This is broadly construed to include forefront problems in cosmological,
galactic, stellar, and planetary astrophysics.

The Fellow will collaborate with faculty members in the Arizona
Theoretical Astrophysics Program (TAP), which currently includes over 15
faculty members drawn from the departments of Astronomy, Physics, and
Planetary Sciences. The Fellow is expected to interact significantly
with faculty in more than one department, and will also have the
opportunity to tie into a broad range of ground- and space-based
projects underway at Arizona. An annual stipend of $45 K plus $5 K for
research expenditures will be paid to the Fellow.

The application review process will start December 1, 2000 and will
continue until the position is filled.

Applicant is asked to submit a cover letter (making specific reference
to the Prize Fellowship), a curriculum vitae, a bibliography, a
description of the anticipated research program and how the applicant
might work productively in more than one of the TAP departments, and any
preprints deemed important.

The applicant must also arrange for three letters of recommendation to
be sent, preferably for arrival before December 1.

Please send all material to Prof. J. I. Lunine, Chair, Arizona
Theoretical Astrophysics Program, LPL/UA, P.O. Box 210092, 1629 E.
University Blvd. Tucson AZ 85721-0092, USA.
