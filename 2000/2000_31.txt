	    TITLE:   "Detecting non-gaussianity in the CMB"


ABSTRACT:
With the cosmological principle as the basic premise, there are currently
two main competing theories for the origin of structure in the
universe---inflation and cosmic defects. While standard inflationary
models predict Gaussianity, other theories like isocurvature inflation and
cosmic defects give non-Gaussianity.
This talk investigates the test of non-Gaussianity in the CMB as a
technique for distinguishing between different models of structure
formation. Two different methods are proposed: one being capable of
extracting the non-Gaussian signal from a very strong Gaussian background,
and the other being sensitive to scale-scale correlations which are
generically expected in defect models. A review of this field and an
update of the current status of different models will also be summarized.

Dear Colleagues, 

**********AUSTRALIA TELESCOPE NATIONAL FACILITY ***********

Applications for observing time are now invited for the 2000OCT term 
for the following telescopes:

Compact Array, Narrabri 
Parkes telescope, Parkes 
Mopra telescope, Coonabarabran 
VLBI observations 

*********************************************************************** 
CLOSING DATE for applications is 12th July 2000 
For 3 month Observing term October 1st to December 30th 2000 
************************************************************************

For the Compact Array, proposers should note that the term will start in 
the 6A configuration. The other configurations offered for the term are the 
6C, 1.5B, 1.5C, 750B and 750C arrays.

In addition there will be a limited amount of commissioning/science time
available for 22 GHz observations using two of the Compact Array telescopes. 
22 GHz telescope applications should include an ATNF staff member.

Application forms, telescope documentation and full information on how to 
apply for ATNF telescope time are available on the web at the address 
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/observers/

Please note that the scientific case for telescope applications should not 
exceed a total of 3 pages (including figures). A font size of at least 10 point

should be used.
