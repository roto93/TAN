	    TITLE:   "Distribution of Molecular Abundances in Prestellar Cores:
                      As a Probe of the Collapse Time Scale" 
                      
            ABSTRACT: 

We investigate the evolution and distribution of molecules in collapsing
prestellar cores, adopting the Larson-Penston solution and its delayed
analogues as  collapse models.
In a fluid element, which is flowing inward, the gaseous molecules
are adsorbed onto grains and are depleted as time evolves
and the density increases. The depletion time scale is
different for different species; CCS depletes on a shorter time scale
than CO, and N$_2$H$^+$ depletes at the last moment.
Molecular abundances and distributions in the collapsing core are
determined by the balance among the dynamical,
chemical and adsorption time scales.
When the central density of the core
$n_{\rm H}$ rises to $3\times 10^6$ cm$^{-3}$, the distribution of
CCS and CO column densities shows a central hole of radius
7000 AU and 4000 AU, respectively,
while the column density of N$_2$H$^+$ is centrally peaked. These predictions
are consistent with observations of the prestellar core L1544.
If the dynamical time scale of the core is larger than that of
the Larson-Penston solution owing to magnetic fields, rotation,
or turbulence, the column densities of CO and CCS are smaller, and
their holes are larger than in the Larson-Penston core with the same central
gas density. On the other hand, N$_2$H$^+$ and NH$_3$ are more abundant
in the more slowly collapsing core. Therefore, molecular distributions
can be probes in the investigation of the collapse time scale of the core.
We also investigate deuterium fractionation in the core.
The deuterium fraction in molecules increases as the core evolves and
molecular depletion proceeds. When the central density of the core is
$n_{\rm H}= 3\times 10^6$ cm$^{-3}$, the ratio DCO$^+$/HCO$^+$ at the
center is in the range 0.06-0.27, depending on the collapse time scale and
adsorption energy; this range is in reasonable agreement with the observed
value in L1544.
