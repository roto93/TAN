                             OCPA 2000

     The Third Joint Meeting of Chinese Physicists Worldwide
                             to be held
                                 at

                 The Chinese University of Hong Kong
                          
                          July 31 - Aug 4, 2000


As our scientific program is beginning to shape up, OCPA 2000
promises to be another exciting opportunity for physicists
worldwide to exchange views on interdisciplinary topics, and
to network.

Due to the timely work of our session coordinators, some of our 
sessions are quickly filling up with topics and speakers that
highlight the achievements of ethnic Chinese physicists across
the world.

The OCPA Hong Kong Meeting offers conference grants to junior-rank
physicists from China Mainland (see
http://www.ocpaweb.org/hkconf/2nd_ann.html).  The deadline for the
application of these grants is February 29, 2000.  Please communicate
this information to your colleagues in China so that they can avail
themselves of this opportunity. Many applications have already been
received and we look forward to a significant number of active 
participants from China Mainland.

To maximize the number of participants and for the conveniences of many
OCPA members, we have extended the deadline for the submission of
abstracts to March 31, 2000.  We invite you to submit your abstract to
the HK Secretariat (pyho@phy.cuhk.edu.hk, and the information below)
so that the session coordinators may schedule your talk.

For OCPA members traveling from N. America, Europe, Taiwan, and
Singapore, because of their burden of overseas travel, OCPA will use
part of its resources to provide some partial local support for these
members, with life-members to get a partial subsidy and regular members
half of the partial subsidy.  The exact amount of the subsidy depends
on the number of members requesting partial support and on OCPA
resources.  

OCPA members may wish to upgrade their membership to life-membership
or to renew their existing regular membership.  Please get in touch
with OCPA Treasurer, Kok-Ming Leung at mleung@prism.poly.edu.

Our sessions in the Hong Kong Meeting include:

ACC   Accelerator Physics
AST   Astrophysics
AMO   Atomic Molecular & Chemical Physics
BIO   Bio-physics
CMP   Computer Physics
CMT   Condensed Matter Theory
CME   Condensed Matter Experiment
HEP   High Energy Physics
PNP   Particle & Nuclear Physics
PLS   Plasma Physics
STP   Statistical Physics
THP   Theoretical Physics

Apart from traditional topics in the above subfields our Hong Kong Meeting will
cover other interdisciplinary topics including: (in random order)

        Interface between Classical and Quantum Physics:
                Emergent Phenomena in Chaos and in Condensed Matter
 
        Science and Technology of Advanced Light Sources
 
        Science and Technology of Nanotubes & Nanowires:
                Its Present & Its Future
 
        Frontiers in Bose-Einstein Condensation
 
        Gravitation, Cosmology and Astrophysics:
                Advances in Computational Modeling
 
        Advances in Instructional Technology:
                Multi-Media Physics
 
        New Approaches in Accelerator Physics
 
        Frontiers in Observational and Theoretical Astrophysics
 
        Cross-Disciplinary Experimental Physics & Precision Measurements
 
        Basic Research and the Bridge to Industry & Business
                How does Society benefit from Research ?
 
        AstroParticle Physics & Big Bang Cosmology:
                From Kamiokande on the Earth to Hubble in the Sky

        Quantum Information
 
        Ultrafast and/or Untra-high Resolution Laser Spectroscopy
 
        Pollution-free Green Chemistry
 
        Atomic and Molecular Processes in the Presence of External Field
 
        Hot topics in AMO/Chemical Physics

There will be a session in honor of Madam C.S. Wu, featuring
talks by women physicists who best exemplify the role of Madame
Wu in experimental physics.

The organizers are also planning outreach sessions on the bridge
between physics and society, both in terms of new approaches in
education, and in terms of the new role for physicists in industry and
business.  Watch out for further announcements for these outreach
sessions as details become available.

Look forward to seeing you in Hong Kong this year.
