	  First announcement for  the 1st Eddington Workshop
	  ``Stellar-structure and habitable planet finding''

		   Cordoba (Spain), 11-15 June 2001


Eddington is a 1.2-metre space  telescope with a wide-field imager for
extra-solar  planet  hunting   by  transits   and   for  asteroseismic
observations,  with  ample opportunities  for  parallel and  ancillary
science.   This workshop  is  an invitation  to  the wider  scientific
community to  get involved in  the refinement of the  mission concept,
and  to participate  in the  science and  technology of  the Eddington
mission.

This workshop follows on the recent ESA decision to adopt Eddington as
a "reserve mission", for a launch in the 2007-2013 time-frame.

Eddington,  with a  telescope of  nominal 1.2-metre  aperture and  a 3
degree field of view with  a CCD imager for high-precision photometry,
and a five-year life, has two primary goals:

  1) to find habitable  planets outside of our solar  system using the
     transit method

  2) to  provide  data  on  the  evolution  and  age  of  stars  using
asteroseismic techniques.

There will also be  opportunities for parallel imaging and photometric
science during  the planet and asteroseismology  observations, as well
as the  possibility, for  a fraction  of the total  time, to  point at
different type of targets, in an "observatory-like" fashion.

While building  on the small  national missions COROT, MONS  and MOST,
the  large  collecting area  of  the  Eddington  telescope allows  the
detection of  habitable planets around solar-type stars  (out of reach
for  the  smaller  missions)  and  provides the  data  on  oscillation
frequencies needed to perform asteroseismic investigations of critical
phases of stellar  evolution, e.g. stars in open  clusters and Pop. II
stars, thus allowing for a major quantum step in both disciplines. The
baseline plan is that these two  main investigations will be done in a
series of month-long pointings at asteroseismic targets, followed by a
three-year  pointing  at  the  planet field.   The  general  astronomy
pointings will be done within this time-frame.

In the  course of  2000 the mission  has been  the subject of  a study
leading to a  mission concept which was successfully  presented to ESA
for approval in September 2000. In the next two years detailed studies
of the whole  mission concept, and in particular  of the payload, will
be  performed.  This workshop  is  an  open  invitation to  the  wider
scientific  community  to  provide  input  to  the  Eddington  mission
concept, and  get involved  in the following  phases of  the Eddington
mission.

More information on  the Eddington baseline design can  be obtained at
http://astro.esa.int/SA-general/Projects/Eddington/.   Copies  of  the
report on the  Eddington study performed in the  course of 2000, where
the  baseline mission concept  is described  in detail,  are available
upon    request    from     the    Study    Scientist    F.     Favata
(ffavata@astro.estec.esa.nl).

The programme  will include a  presentation of the various  aspects of
the  mission's present  baseline  and scientific  performance, and  an
overview of the mission's  science goals.  Contributions are solicited
on all aspects of the mission,  on both the scientific side as well as
the industrial side.   A formal call for abstracts  will be circulated
later this year, together with  a preliminary programme with a list of
invited  speakers.  An "expression  of interest"  form is  appended to
this     announcement,     which     should     be     returned     to
eddi2001@astro.estec.esa.nl.  The  same address can  also be contacted
with any  question regarding  the workshop. Updated  information about
the    Workshop   will    be   made    available   at    the   address
http://astro.esa.int/SA-general/Projects/Eddington/Eddi2001

Please feel  free to pass this  message to any colleague  who might be
interested in  the meeting and who  may not be in  the initial mailing
list. Note that  the invitation is equally open  to scientists working
both in ESA- and non-ESA-member states.

Conference venue and information about the city of Cordoba

Cordoba is in the middle  of the Spanish southern region of Andalusia,
about 120 km northeast of Seville  and 160 km northwest of Granada. It
has a population of 300,000 and  lies at the foot of the Sierra Morena
and on the bank of the Guadalquivir River.

Cordoba has a  very rich history. Probably of  Carthaginian in origin,
was occupied by  the Romans in 152 BC. The  city flourished and became
the capital of the prosperous province of Baetica. Then declined under
the rule  of the Visigoths from  the 6th century to  711, when Cordoba
was largely destroyed by the Muslims. Thy nevertheless made of Cordoba
their capital  in 756  and Abd al-Rahman  I founded the  Great Mosque,
while  the  city grew  rapidly.  After  927,  when Abd  al-Rahman  III
proclaimed himself caliph of the  West, Cordoba became the largest and
probably the most  cultured city in Europe. It  fell to the Castilians
in 1236 and became part of Christian Spain.

Cordoba  remains  a typically  Andalusian  city  with narrow  streets,
especially in the old Jewish quarter (La Juderia). A Moorish bridge on
Roman   bases   connects  Cordoba   with   its   suburbs  across   the
river.  Besides,  the Great  Mosque,  many  palaces, monasteries,  and
churches,  are found  in Cordoba  from different  times  together with
typical houses with colourful patios.

In addition,  there are  many possibilities in  Cordoba to  taste good
food, have "tapas" with a large variety of options and drink wine from
the nearby village of Montilla.

The  workshop will take  place in  the Palacio  de Congresos  which is
located in a refurbished XVIth century building in the old part of the
city, very close  to the Mosque, and at walking  distance from most of
the selected hotels.

To reach Cordoba, the best way is  to fly to Madrid or Sevilla and use
the fast speed  train (AVE) which runs every  hour from Madrid (Atocha
AVE  Station)  to  Sevilla  (Santa  Justa  Station)  with  a  stop  in
Cordoba. The  time from Madrid to  Cordoba is approximately  1 hour 45
minutes and from  Sevilla to Cordoba is 45 minutes.  The train is also
very convenient for one day visits to Sevilla while in Cordoba.
