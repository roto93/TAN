> Dear Colleagues,
>
> We are very pleased to announce IAU Symposium 209,
> "Planetary Nebulae: Their Evolution and Role in the Universe"
> to be held at Canberra, Australia in November 19-23, 2001.
>
> Following the previous IAU symposia on Planetary Nebulae (PN),
> in Czechoslovakia (1967), USA (1976), UK (1982), Mexico (1987),
> Austria (1992) and The Netherlands (1996), the 2001 PN symposium
> will be held in Australia's capital Canberra.  Research on PN
> has undergone a renaissance in recent years. Observations from
> space (IUE, IRAS, ROSAT, HST, ISO, etc.) have revealed these objects
> to be more complex and physically interesting than had previously been
> suspected. Since the last symposium, infrared spectroscopic
> observations by ISO have identified new molecular and solid state
> species with significant implications on our understanding of the
> fields of interstellar chemistry and grain formation mechanisms.
> High resolution optical observations with the HST have revealed
> many new kinds of structures and jets. By the date of the
> symposium, new data from FUSE and AXAF will have become available
> to shed new light on the nature of such structures.
>
> The conference will cover the following major topics:
> - PN surveys and their distribution in the galaxies
> - PN in the scheme of stellar evolution
> - Central stars and their atmospheres
> - Nebular Properties of PN
> - PN as galaxy probes
>
> This email has been widely distributed, but please make sure your
> colleagues are aware of IAU Symposium 209.
>
> The conference will be held in the Dome of the Academy of
> Sciences, surrounded by gardens, adjacent to the ANU campus, and
> overlooking Lake Burley Griffin in the heart of Australia's "bush
> capital" (see http://www.act.gov.au).
>
> Early summer is very pleasant in Canberra (15-28 C) and it is
> an excellent time to get a flavor of this spacious planned city
> and visit its many interesting institutions.
> The traditional symposium dinner and the always successful
> Australian wine-tasting evening will be organized, as well as a
> tour of Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve.
