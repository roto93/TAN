==============================================================================

With the arrival of large sub-mm and mm-wave detector arrays, the last
two years have seen the opening of a new window on galaxy formation
and evolution.  At the same time, major new facilities now being
designed and constructed such as ALMA (MMA) and the Large Millimeter
Telescope (LMT) will soon be expanding the horizons even farther.  The
UMass/INAOE Conference on "Deep Millimeter Surveys: Implications For
Galaxy Formation And Evolution" is intended to draw together the
various groups working on sub-mm and mm-wave galaxies to discuss their
relation to other galaxies both nearby and in the early Universe,
the role of LMT and other new facilities currently being planned in
advancing the new field, and the implications of the new results and
models for our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution.



                        ********************
                        TOPICS TO BE COVERED
                        ********************

        * mm and sub-mm source counts and modeling
        * Molecular lines in the mm
        * Redshift distributions of mm-wave sources
        * Star formation rates, metallicities, masses, and
            luminosities of mm-wave-selected galaxies
        * Ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) in the mm
        * The search for forming galaxies
        * Radio, IR, optical, UV, and X-ray counterparts
        * Microwave Background and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect
        * New facilities (LMT/GTM, ALMA, etc.)
        * New instrumentation (focal plane arrays, broad-band
                spectrometers, etc.)

			       LOCATION
			       ********

Amherst is nestled in the gorgeous Pioneer Valley of Western
Massachusetts, minutes from the Connecticut River and a short trip
from the Berkshire Mountains.  The area is rich in natural and human
history.  With the University and Amherst, Hampshire, Mt. Holyoke, and
Smith Colleges all nearby, it is also one of the cultural epicenters
of New England, enjoying abundant arts, music, theater, literature, and
academic activities.  Several excursions and activities will be
planned for conference attendees.

We are about an hour's drive from Hartford/Springfield's Bradley
International Airport, about two hours from Boston, and about 3.5
hours from New York City, all accessible by public transportation.

The weather in June is usually sunny and warm but not hot.
