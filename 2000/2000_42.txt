Subject: IMISS2, IRAM mm school

Dear Colleagues,

 I would like to draw your attention on the announcement of the Second 
 ``IRAM mm Interferometric Summer School''. 

 IRAM plans to organize its second ``mm Interferometry Summer
 School'' in June 2000. The school will take place at the IRAM
 headquarters, in Grenoble, from June 12th to June 16th.   The
 school is intended for PhD students, post-docs and scientists with
 or without a priori knowledge of radio interferometry techniques.
 In the same spirit as the first school, it will be focused on the
 specifics and applications of the millimeter domain, with examples
 from the Plateau de Bure Interferometer.

  For this second school, we would like to encourage participants to
 present posters related to their own experience in interferometry
 (VLBI, cm, mm, optical...). In their posters, they should
 emphasize 1) the choice of the observing strategy with respect to
 the scientific goals, 2) the possible problems encountered during
 observations, data reduction or image analysis with their possible
 impact on data quality and science, 3) the scientific results.

 IRAM lecturers will also provide posters. These posters will
 complement the lectures by presenting observational techniques used
 at the Plateau de Bure Interferometer, their limitations and
 possible instrumental biases.

  Finally, a special session will be dedicated to a qualitative
 comparison between mm and optical interferometry techniques.

 The number of participants will be limited to a maximum of 50 persons.
 Participation to the school will be free of charges, but participants are expected   to pay their own travel and lodging expenses. IRAM will provide information and assistance for hotel reservations, please contact C.Berjaud (berjaud@iram.fr).

   More details about registration and the final program can be found 
 on our web-page at http://iram.fr 

  All the Best

 Anne Dutrey
