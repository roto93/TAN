{\Large\bf Release of the INES Archive 
}\\ \bigskip\end{center}

The International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) Archives have been delivered
to the world scientific community on 21st March. ESA, in collaboration with
the Spanish Laboratory of Space Astrophysics and Theoretical Physics
(LAEFF) belonging to INTA (National Institute of Air and Space Technology),
has developed and set up the INES system to access IUE Data.

INES (IUE Newly Extracted Spectra) is a complete astronomical archive and
data-distribution system. Its release to the community represents the final
activity by ESA in the context of the IUE project. From now LAEFF, on
behalf of the international astronomical community, will be responsible of
maintaining INES, making it available and providing world-wide support to
scientists using IUE data.

The IUE Archive contains more than 110,000 spectra of more that 11,000
astronomical objects. All data are fully reduced and calibrated.  The INES
archive consists of:

\begin{itemize}
\item an access catalog containing the parameters required to query the 
   archive and evaluate the observations,
\item a publications catalog which links each spectrum to the publications in 
   which it has been used via the ADS, 
\item and the data themselves (low dispersion spectra, high dispersion
   spectra rebinned to the low resolution wavelength step, full high
   dispersion concatenated spectra, and bi-dimensional low dispersion images).
\end{itemize}

The INES Archive can be accessed at {\tt http://ines.vilspa.esa.es}.  Users can
consult the catalogue, preview the spectra and download the data with a
standard browser from the Principal Centre at LAEFF, its Mirror Centre
located at the Canadian Astronomical Data Centre or any of the National
Centres spread in all continents. This distributed system guarantees the
availability and efficient access to the data.

Questions about the INES archive can be directed to the INES Help Desk at

   We present spectrophotometry in the 3600--9700 \AA\ region for a
   sample of 39 H\,{\sc ii} regions in the Galaxy and Magellanic Clouds,
   for which independent information is available on the spectral
   types and effective temperatures of the ionizing stars.  The
   spectra have been used to evaluate nebular diagnostics
   of stellar temperature, metal abundance, and ionization parameter,
   and compare the observed behavior of the line indices with predictions
   of nebular photoionization models.  We observe a strong degeneracy
   between forbidden-line sequences produced by changes in stellar 
   $T_{\!\em eff}$
   and metal abundance, which severely complicates the application of
   many forbidden-line diagnostics to extragalactic H\,{\sc ii} regions.  Our
   data confirm however that the Edmunds \& Pagel 
   [O\,{\sc ii}]$+$[O\,{\sc iii}]
   abundance index and the V\'{\i}lchez \& Pagel \etap\ index provide
   more robust diagnostics
   of metal abundance and stellar effective temperature, respectively.
   A comparison of the fractional helium ionization of the H\,{\sc ii} regions
   with stellar temperature confirms the reliability of the spectral
   type vs $T_{\!\em eff}$\  calibration for the relevant temperature range
   $T_{\!\em eff} \le$ 38000 K.  We use empirical relations between the nebular
   hardness indices and $T_{\!\em eff}$ to reinvestigate the case for systematic
   variations in the stellar effective temperatures and the upper IMFs of
   massive stars in extragalactic H\,{\sc ii} regions.  The data are consistent
   with a significant softening of the ionizing spectra (consistent with
   cooler stellar temperatures) with increasing metal abundance, especially
   for $Z \le$ \zsun.  However unresolved degeneracies between $Z$ and 
   $T_{\!\em eff}$\ still complicate the interpretation of this result.

We examine the supernova remnant (SNR)  0540$-$697 in the Large Magellanic
Cloud (LMC) using data from the {\it Chandra\ } ACIS.  The X-ray emission from
this SNR had previously been hidden in the bright emission of nearby X-ray
binary LMC X-1;  however, new observations with {\it Chandra\ } can finally
reveal the SNR's structure and spectrum. We find the SNR to be a
thick-shelled structure about 19 pc in diameter, with a brightened
northeast region.  Spectral results suggest a temperature of 0.31 keV and
an X-ray luminosity (0.3--3.0 keV) of 8.4 $\times 10^{33}$ erg s$^{-1}$.  
We estimate an age of 12,000--20,000 yr for this SNR, but note that this
estimate does not take into account the possibility of cavity expansion or
other environmental effects.

The new transient X-ray pulsar XTE~J0111.2--7317 was observed with 
{\it Advanced Satellite for Cosmology and Astrophysics} ({\it ASCA})
on 1998 November 18, a few days after its discovery with the Proportional
Counter Array onboard the {\it Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer}. The source 
was detected at a flux level of $3.6\times10^{-10}$~erg~cm$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$ 
in the 0.7--10.0~keV band, which corresponds to the X-ray luminosity of 
$1.8\times10^{38}$~erg~s$^{-1}$, if a distance of 65 kpc for this pulsar 
in the Small Magellanic Cloud is assumed.  Nearly sinusoidal pulsations 
with a period of $30.9497 \pm 0.0004$~s were unambiguously detected during 
the {\it ASCA} observation. The pulsed fraction is low and slightly energy 
dependent with average value of $\sim27$\%.  The energy spectrum shows a 
large soft excess below $\sim 2$~keV when fitted to a simple power-law type 
model. The soft excess is eliminated if the spectrum is fitted to an 
``inversely broken power-law'' model, in which photon indices below and 
above a break energy of 1.5~keV are 2.3 and 0.8, respectively.
The soft excess can also be described by a blackbody or a thermal 
bremsstrahlung when the spectrum above $\sim 2$~keV is modeled by a 
power-law.  In these models, however, the thermal soft component requires 
a very large emission zone, and hence it is difficult to explain the observed 
pulsations at energies below 2~keV. A bright state of the source enables
us to identify a weak iron line feature at 6.4~keV with an equivalent width 
of $50\pm14$~eV. Pulse phase resolved spectroscopy revealed a slight 
hardening of the spectrum and marginal indication of an increase 
in the iron line strength during the pulse maximum. \\

An ultraviolet and optical spectral atlas of 15 O stars in the SMC is
presented and described.  The echelle data have resolving powers of order
$10^4$; they were obtained with HST/STIS in the UV, and at the AAT or the
ESO 3.6~m in the optical.  The ultimate objective is to develop
metal-deficient templates for the interpretation of distant starbursts, 
but here we discuss interesting new properties of the SMC stars themselves, 
revealed by the high quality of these data.  The SMC metal deficiency 
produces anomalously weak stellar-wind profiles along the entire O main 
sequence, as well as at intermediate luminosities; the first intermediate 
Si~IV $\lambda1400$ wind profile in the SMC is shown.  The second known Of 
star in the SMC displays wind peculiarities that are identical to those of 
its spectral classmate, again likely due to the low systemic metallicity.  
Several objects display marked CNO anomalies, including the first cases of 
C~III $\lambda4650$ emission without N~III $\lambda4640$ in O-type spectra.
The N/C ratio appears to increase with mass, extent of evolution away from 
the ZAMS, and/or rotational velocity in the young cluster NGC~346.  In 
addition, the first examples of Onfp (Oef) and Of?p spectra in the SMC have 
been found (the latter being only the fourth member of its peculiar shell 
category known anywhere).  The UV wind characteristics of these objects 
correlate with their optical peculiarities.  All of these spectroscopic 
phenomena provide diagnostics of the evolutionary status of metal-deficient 
massive stars.

We investigate, on the basis of CCD Str\"omgren photometry, the ages
and metallicities of six LMC clusters together with their
surrounding field population. The clusters and metallicities are:
NGC 1651 (in the range $[Fe/H]=-0.65$ dex to $-0.41$ dex), NGC 1711
($-0.57\pm0.17$ dex), NGC 1806 ($-0.71\pm0.23$ dex), NGC 2031
($-0.52\pm0.21$ dex) and NGC 2136/37 ($-0.55\pm0.23$ dex) and
NGC 2257 ($-1.63\pm0.21$ dex).  The metallicities for NGC 1651,
NGC 1711, NGC 1806 and NGC 2031 have been determined for the first
time (NGC 2031 and NGC 2136/37 are interesting for the Cepheid
distance scale). 

In the cluster surroundings, we found about 650 field stars that
were suitable to be used for a determination of an age-metallicity
relation (AMR).  Our method is to estimate ages for individual
stars on the basis of Str\"omgren isochrones with individually
measured metallicities.  With this method we are able to sample the
AMR of the field population up to 8 Gyr.

Our metallicity data are incompatible with models predicting many
metal-poor stars (G-dwarf problem). The metallicity of the field
population increased by a factor of six, starting around 2 Gyr ago.
The proposed AMR is consistent with the AMR of the LMC cluster
system (including ESO 121 SC03 and three clusters with an age of 4
Gyr). 

The proposed AMR is incompatible with the
recently proposed AMR by Pagel \& Tautvai\u{s}vien\.e
(1998).

We present a detailed study of the cluster pair SL\,353 \& SL\,349. This
candidate binary cluster is located at the northwestern rim of the LMC
bar. Based on photometric data we find that both clusters are coeval
with an age of 550$\pm$100 Myr. We use the Ca\,II triplet in the spectra of
individual red giants to derive radial velocities. Both components of the 
binary cluster candidate show very similar mean velocities ($\approx274\pm10$
km\,$\mbox{s}^{-1}$ for SL\,349 and $\approx279\pm4$ km\,$\mbox{s}^{-1}$ for
SL\,353) while the field stars show lower velocities ($\approx240\pm19$
km\,$\mbox{s}^{-1}$). These findings suggest a common origin of the two
clusters from the same GMC. In this sense the cluster pair may constitute a
true binary cluster. We furthermore investigate the stellar densities in and
around the star clusters and compare them with isopleths created from
artificial, interacting as well as non-interacting star
clusters. Gravitational interaction leads to a distortion which can also be
found in the observed pair.

Binary clusters account for more than 10\% of the cluster population in the
Magellanic Clouds.  Statistically fewer than 50\% of the found pairs are
expected to be chance superpositions. We estimated the cluster encounter rate
and suggest that tidal capture is an unlikely formation scenario for the
formation of binary clusters. Thus, most {\it true} binary clusters can be
expected to have formed together.

Here we present a study of three binary cluster candidates which are
located in the bar of the LMC.
NGC\,1971 \& NGC\,1972 are situated in the association LH\,59 in the eastern
part of the bar. A third star cluster, NGC\,1969, is close enough to this pair
that all three objects may constitute a triple system. We present the first age
determination that is based on CMDs for these star clusters. Our findings
suggest that all three clusters are young (40-70 Myr) and may have been formed
in the same GMC. It cannot clearly decided whether the clusters are physically
interacting or not.

NGC\,1894 \& SL\,341 are located at the south-western rim of the LMC bar. This
pair is studied in detail for the first time: The isopleths of both clusters
reveal an elliptical shape. Whether this might be interpreted as a sign of
interaction or is a peculiarity which is shared with a large amount of LMC
star clusters which show higher ellipticities than their counterparts in the
Milky Way remains unclear. From our age determination we find that both
clusters are coeval with an age of $55\pm5$ Myr. This makes a formation from
the same GMC a likely scenario.

SL\,385 \& SL\,387 are a close pair in the western part of the LMC bar.  We
derived ages of $170\pm30$ Myr for SL\,385 and $\ge250$ for SL\,387. The large
age difference makes it unlikely that these two clusters formed in the same
GMC.

We present a precise determination of the apparent
magnitude of the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) in the $I$ ($0.8
\mu$m), $J$ ($1.25 \mu$m), and $K_S$ ($2.15 \mu$m) bands from the
luminosity function of a sample of data extracted from the DENIS
catalogue towards the Magellanic Clouds (Cioni et
al.\ 2000). From the $J$ and $K_S$ magnitudes we derive
bolometric magnitudes $m_{bol}$. We present a new algorithm for the
determination of the TRGB magnitude, which we describe in detail and
test extensively using Monte-Carlo simulations. We note that any
method that searches for a peak in the first derivative (used by most
authors) or the second derivative (used by us) of the observed
luminosity function does not yield an unbiased estimate for the actual
magnitude of the TRGB discontinuity. We stress the importance of
correcting for this bias, which is not generally done. We combine the
results of our algorithm with theoretical predictions to derive the
distance modulus of the Magellanic Clouds. We obtain $m-M = 18.55 \pm
0.04$ (formal) $\pm 0.08$ (systematic) for the Large Magellanic Cloud
(LMC), and $m-M = 18.99 \pm 0.03$ (formal) $\pm 0.08$ (systematic) for
the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). These are among the most accurate
determinations of these quantities currently available, which is a
direct consequence of the large size of our sample and the
insensitivity of near infrared observations to dust extinction.

We  use the results from recent computations of
updated non-linear convective pulsating models to constrain
the distance modulus of Galactic globular clusters through
the observed periods of first overtone ($RR_c$) pulsators.
The resulting  relation between the mean absolute magnitude of
RR Lyrae stars $<M_V(RR)>$ and the heavy element content $[Fe/H]$
appears well in the
range of several previous empirical calibrations, but with
a non linear dependence on $[Fe/H]$ so that the slope of
the relation increases when moving towards larger metallicities.
On this ground, our results suggest that metal-poor ($[Fe/H]<$-1.5) and
metal-rich ($[Fe/H]>$-1.5) variables follow two
different linear $<M_V(RR)>-[Fe/H]$ relations.
Application to RR Lyrae stars in the metal-poor globular clusters
of the Large Magellanic Cloud provides a LMC distance modulus of the
order of 18.6 mag, thus supporting  the ``long" distance scale.
The comparison with recent predictions based on updated stellar evolution
theory is shortly presented and discussed.\\

We derive structural parameters and evidence for extended tidal debris
from star count and preliminary standard candle analyses of the Large
Magellanic Cloud based on Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS)
data.  The full-sky coverage and low extinction in $K_s$ presents an
ideal sample for structural analysis of the LMC.

The star count surface densities and deprojected inclination for both
young and older populations are consistent with previous work.  We use
the full areal coverage and large LMC diameter to Galactocentric
distance ratio to infer the same value for the disk inclination based
on perspective.

A standard candle analysis based on a sample of carbon long-period
variables (LPV) in a narrow color range, $1.6<J-K_s<1.7$ allows us to
probe the three-dimensional structure of the LMC along the line of
sight.  The intrinsic brightness distribution of carbon LPVs in
selected fields implies that $\sigma_M\simlt 0.2^m$ for this color
cut.  The sample provides a {\it direct} determination of the LMC disk
inclination: $42.3^\circ\pm 7.2^\circ$.

Distinct features in the
photometric distribution suggest several distinct populations.  We
interpret this as the presence of an extended stellar component of the
LMC, which may be as thick as $14$~kpc, and intervening tidal debris
at roughly 15 kpc from the LMC.

  We compare the distribution of stars of different spectral types, and hence
mean age, within the central SMC and find that the asymmetric structures are
almost exclusively composed of young main sequence stars. Because of the
relative lack of older stars in these features, and the extremely regular
distribution of red giant and clump stars in the SMC central body, we conclude
that tides alone are not responsible for the irregular appearance of the
central SMC. The dominant physical mechanism in determining the current-day
appearance of the SMC must be star formation triggered by a hydrodynamic
interaction between gaseous components. These results extend the results of
population studies (cf. Gardiner and Hatzidimitriou) inward in radius and also
confirm the suggestion of the spheroidal nature of the central SMC based on
kinematic arguments (Dopita et al; Hardy, Suntzeff \& Azzopardi). Finally, we
find no evidence in the underlying older stellar population for a ``bar'' or
``outer arm'', again supporting our classification of the central SMC as a
spheroidal body with highly irregular recent star formation.

We report on our search for microlensing towards the Large Magellanic
Cloud (LMC).  Analysis of 5.7 years of photometry on 11.9 million stars 
in the LMC reveals 13 -- 17 microlensing events.  A detailed treatment 
of our detection efficiency shows that this is significantly more than 
the $\sim$ 2 to 4 events expected from lensing by known stellar populations.
The timescales ($\that$) of the events range from 34 to 230 days.  We 
estimate the microlensing optical depth towards the LMC from events with 
$2 < \that < 400$ days to be $\tau_2^{400} = 1.2 ^{+0.4}_{-0.3} \ten{-7}$, 
with an additional 20\% to 30\% of systematic error.  The spatial 
distribution of events is mildly inconsistent with LMC/LMC disk self-lensing, 
but is consistent with an extended lens distribution such as a Milky Way or 
LMC halo.  Interpreted in the context of a Galactic dark matter halo, 
consisting partially of compact objects, a maximum likelihood analysis 
gives a MACHO halo fraction of 20\% for a typical halo model with a 95\% 
confidence interval of 8\% to 50\%.  A 100\% MACHO halo is ruled out at 
the 95\% C.L. for all except our most extreme halo model.  Interpreted as 
a Galactic halo population, the most likely MACHO mass is between $ 0.15 
\msun$ and $ 0.9 \msun$, depending on the halo model, and the total mass 
in MACHOs out to 50 kpc is found to be $9^{+4}_{-3} \ten{10}\msun$,
independent of the halo model.  These results are marginally consistent 
with our previous results, but are lower by about a factor of two. This 
is mostly due to Poisson noise because with 3.4 times more exposure and 
increased sensitivity to long timescale events, we did not find the 
expected factor of $\sim 4$ more events.  Besides a larger data set, this 
work also includes an improved efficiency determination, improved likelihood 
analysis, and more thorough testing of systematic errors, especially with 
respect to the treatment of potential backgrounds to microlensing.
We note that an important source of background are supernovae (SNe) in
galaxies behind the LMC.  \\

The MACHO project is a search for dark matter in the form of massive compact
halo objects (MACHOs).  The project has photometrically monitored tens of
millions of stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), Small Magellanic Cloud
(SMC), and Galactic bulge in search of rare gravitational microlensing events
caused by these otherwise invisible objects.  In 5.7 years of
observations toward the LMC some 13--17 microlensing events have
been observed by the MACHO survey, allowing powerful statements to be made
about the nature of the dark population in the halo of our Galaxy.
A critical component of these statements is an accurate determination of the
survey's detection efficiency.  The detection efficiency is a complicated
function of temporal sampling, stellar crowding (the luminosity function),
image quality, photometry, time-series analysis, and criteria used to
select the microlensing candidates.  Such a complex interdependence is
most naturally solved using a Monte Carlo approach.
Here we describe the details of the Monte Carlo used to calculate the
efficiency presented in the MACHO 5.7-year LMC results.  A similar
calculation was performed for MACHO's 1-year and 2-year results.  Here we
correct several shortcomings of these past determinations,
including (1) adding fainter source stars (2.5 magnitudes below our faintest
detected ``stars''), (2) an up-to-date luminosity function for the LMC,
(3) better sampling of real images in both stellar density and observing
conditions, (4) an improved scheme for adding artificial microlensing
onto a random sample of real lightcurves, and many other improvements.
The Monte Carlo technique presented here realistically
simulates the negative effects of severe crowding (blending) that
is a fact of microlensing surveys.  \\

estimated the rate of EAGLE events by taking the finite-source effect in
to account. We found that the EAGLE event rate for using a 1-m class 
telescope whose limiting magnitude is $V \sim 21$ is the same as or higher 
than that of the ordinary microlensing events which have been found to date.
We have also found that the fraction of transit EAGLE events is large enough 
to detect: between $4 \sim 80 \% $ depending on the lens location.
Since the lens proper motion can be measured for a transit event, one can
distinguish whether the lens is a MACHO (MAssive Compact Halo Object) in 
our halo or one of the known stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) 
from the proper motion measurement for each transit EAGLE event.  Moreover, 
we show that the fraction of transit EAGLEs in all EAGLE events significantly 
depends on the lensing locations: the transit EAGLE fraction for the 
self-lensing case is $2 \sim 15$ times larger than that for halo MACHOs.
Thus, one can constrain the location of lens objects by the statistics of the 
transit events fraction.  We show that we can reasonably expect $0 \sim 6$ 
transit events out of 21 EAGLE events in 3 years. We can also constrain the 
lens population properties at a greater than $99 \%$  confidence level 
depending on the number of transit events detected.  We also present the 
duration of EAGLE events, and show how an hourly observational mode is more 
suitable for an EAGLE event search program.  \\

{\em While the following paper does not deal with the Magellanic
Clouds specifically, I invited its submission due to its importance 
for calibrating photometric observations including those of
the Magellanic Clouds.
In particular I expect this paper to be invaluable for anyone doing 
photometry of regions in the Magellanic Clouds using the new large southern 
telescopes.\medskip

Stars appearing in CCD images obtained over 224 nights during the course
of 69 observing runs have been calibrated to the Johnson/Kron-Cousins {\it
BVRI\/} photometric system defined by the equatorial standards of Landolt
(1992, AJ, 104, 340).  More than 15,000 stars suitable for use as
photometric standards have been identified, where ``suitable'' means that
the star has been observed five or more times during photometric
conditions and has a standard error of the mean magnitude less than
0.02\mag\ in at least two of the four bandpasses, and shows no significant
evidence of intrinsic variability.  Many of these stars are in the same
fields as Landolt's equatorial standards or Graham's (1982, PASP, 94,
244) southern E-region standards, but are considerably fainter.  This
enhances the value of those fields for the calibration of photometry
obtained with large telescopes.  Other standards have been defined in
fields containing popular objects of astrophysical interest, such as star
clusters and famous galaxies, extending Landolt-system calibrators to
declinations far from the equator and to stars of sub-Solar chemical
abundances.  I intend to continue to improve and enlarge this set of
photometric standard stars as more observing runs are reduced.  The full
current database of photometric indices is being made freely available via
a site on the World-Wide Web, or by direct request to the author.
Although the contents of the database will evolve in detail, at any given
time it should represent the largest sample of precise {\it BVRI\/}
broad-band photometric standards available anywhere.

\centerline{\Large \bf Postdoctoral Research Associate}
\medskip
\centerline{\Large \bf at the University of Cardiff, U.K.}
\bigskip
\medskip

The Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Cardiff 
invites applications for a postdoctoral research associate position
on a fixed-term contract limited to three years.\\ 

You will be working with Dr.\ Jon Davies on galaxy populations in the 
nearby Universe. From previous work by the Cardiff group it seems 
clear that there are large numbers of very low surface brightness 
low luminosity galaxies in nearby clusters. This leads to a very 
steep luminosity function consistent with numerical simulations of 
structure formation. If these galaxies have large (M/L) they may 
represent the major mass component of the cluster. Given that 
clusters only represent about 10% of the galaxy population we now 
wish to study these low luminosity galaxies in other environments, 
i.e., groups and the general field. We have been awarded large 
amounts of observing time to use large CCD arrays and 21cm multi-beam 
instruments and we are actively pursuing more observational data. 
The research group currently consists of 5 researchers (3 postdoctoral 
and 2 postgraduate). You should hold a PhD in Astronomy or related 
topics, or have submitted your thesis before starting the appointment.\\

The Cardiff astronomy group consists of 12 academic members of staff 
and totals about 45 researchers. Interests range from extra-galactic 
astronomy, to gravity waves and star formation.\\


Closing date for applications is {\em May 19, 2000}.
The start date is as soon as possible.
For informal discussion contact\, Dr. Jon Davies
at the phone number of e-mail address given below.\\
