* SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE:

The evolution of galaxies has become an observational fact mainly after
recent sky surveys (e.g. the HST deep field survey, the Canada-France
redshift survey, or ISO deep surveys), which have shown that the properties
of distant galaxies, formed early in the life of the Universe, differ from
those of nearby ones.  New observational windows at X-ray, ultraviolet,
infrared and millimetric wavelengths (ROSAT, IUE, IRAS, ISO, IRAM) have
revealed that galaxies contain a wealth of components (very hot gas, atomic
hydrogen, molecules, dust, dark matter).  However, theoretical modeling has
not progressed as fast as the census of the content of galaxies.  So far,
most models are very empirical or semi-empirical.  A real understanding of
galaxy evolution requires a proper physical description of the galaxy
components as well as of the coupling and feedback between them: stars and
gas, cold and hot phases of the interstellar medium, large scale and small
scale phenomena.

A significant advance is expected in the near future mostly due to the
conjunction of two circumstances.  On the one hand, the exploration of the
most distant Universe will be possible with the new facilities from ground
and space (e.g. VLT, FIRST, XMM, etc..).  On the other hand, the rapidly
developing computing facilities will permit, for the first time, to provide
self-consistent models of galaxy evolution.  During the next decade, we can
expect a breakthrough in galaxy modeling, in which all the relevant large
and small scale processes will be taken into account in a coherent way.  It
will be possible to test this new generation of models against strong
observational constraints.

We have started a cycle of three Euroconferences on the evolution of
galaxies.  The first conference, devoted to the observational clues,
took place in May 2000 in Grenada (Spain). The second will take place
in October 2001 in the Island of La Reunion (France) in the Indian
Ocean and will address the interplay between the different components
of a galaxy: interstellar matter, star formation, stellar evolution
and death, role of dynamics and environment.  The last one will take
place in July 2002 in Kiel (Germany) and will address the detailed
modeling of galaxy evolution.

Specialists in various fields of Astronomy, observers and
theoreticians are expected to participate.

* SCIENTIFIC ORGANIZATION:

The general idea of this conference is to create the appropriate
environment for discussions between specialist of different fields,
observers and theoreticians, to review the key inputs for galaxy
modeling. Star formation, physics of the interstellar matter,
relation between stellar evolution and galaxy enrichment, relation
between galaxy evolution and environment, primeval galaxy evolution
will be the major topics analyzed during the conference. Emphasis
will be put on the physics of the different processes, their relative
importance and their uncertainties. The conference is composed of a
first day devoted to introductory presentations, followed by 5
consecutive sessions on the different processes relevant for galaxy
evolution. Each of the sessions will be composed of review talks,
contributed oral presentations (these may include progress reports as
well as critical reviews) and posters.  Each session will end with a
general discussion on a key issue for galaxy evolution introduced by
a specialist.

Proceedings of the conference will be published, including reports of
the discussions.

* PARTICIPATION:

Participation of young researchers from European countries is
especially encouraged.

According to the rules on Euroconferences, attendance is limited to
100 persons. The SOC will select the participants on the basis of
their proposed contribution (or motivation for young researchers).
Preference will be given to young researchers participating in all
the three conferences of the series.

The SOC will select for oral presentations the contributions dealing
explicitly with the topic of this second conference. Posters are
welcome, including on the topics related with the themes of the
other conferences of the series.


* FEES:

The conference fee will be 200 Euros (to be confirmed)


* CONFERENCE LOCATION:

The conference will take place in the Island of La Reunion. La
Reunion is a French territory in the south of the Indian Ocean. It
is located eastward of Madagascar, and very close to Mauritius
Island. A large effort is done by the French Government to develop
education and interest for science in La Reunion. The heart of the
educational system is the Universite de l'Ocean Indien, located in
Saint-Denis, the main town of the island. There are two laboratories
of physics, one dealing with the physics of the atmosphere, the
second with geology and volcano activities. The venue of an
international scientific conference supported by the European
Community will have a strong impact on the local students and
population in general. It is for this reason that we have proposed to
hold this conference in La Reunion. A very visible outreach program
is associated with the conference. This program has received an
enthusiastic support from the local authorities. The conference will
benefit from financial support from the different political
authorities of La Reunion.

The conference will take place in the Village Vacances Famille (VVF)
located in Saint Gilles, 30 km west of Saint Denis.  The VVF is a
holiday resort composed a restaurant, a swimming pool, a conference
room and of small houses in a park on the sea side. Each house is
fully equipped for two persons, with one main room, toilet, bathroom,
kitchen and an open air veranda. All houses will be refurbished
within the next 9 months. A shopping center, medical care, small beach
restaurants and cinemas can be found at walking distances. A nice
beach is found just in front of the VVF premises.

The conference presentations and poster sessions will take place in
the VVF conference room, with the exception of the inaugural session,
which will take place in an auditorium in the Saint Denis University.
The sessions in the VVF will be split between morning and
late-afternoon meetings. Lunch will be taken in the VVF restaurant
and will be followed by a couple of hours for free activities
(swimming, snorkeling, sunbathing etcŠ). Dinner will be served in the
VVF restaurant. After dinner, a couple of hours will be devoted to a
discussion of the topic of the day while enjoying local beverages.
The fact that lodging, meals, and scientific activities are located
in a single place benefiting of a beautiful environment should
generate a friendly atmosphere and favor informal scientific
discussions between the participants.

In October, the weather is mildly hot, with average temperature of 26
C in the day. It is usually sunny in the morning, with some possible
rains in the afternoon, and a clear sky at night. Tropical storms and
hurricanes start later during southern summer, usually not before
December or January. The island is very safe, with no endemic
tropical diseases. No special vaccination is required, neither
specific life cares. Drinkable water is available everywhere. While
being part of the high tourist season, October is more quiet than the
peak periods of northern summer, or Christmas holidays. La Reunion is
one of the most beautiful islands of this region. It offers a large
variety of activities, such as trekking in the mountains in the
volcano caldera or in deep river canyons, gliding, canoeing,
snorkeling or scuba diving. The population of La Reunion is well
mixed, with representatives native from India, Africa, Madagascar and
France mainland. The very different origins of the La Reunion
population give a unique flavor to the local way of life. An overview
of La Reunion can be found on the WEB site http/www.ilereunion.net/
(french, english and german versions of the site are available)

* TRANSPORTATION AND LODGING

Saint Denis can be easily reached by plane from Paris. There are 3
direct flights per day, one by Air France, one by AOM, and another by
Corsair, the airline belonging to Nouvelles Frontieres. The fares
range from 3800 FF (570 Euros) to 6000 FF (900 Euros). British Airways
also also operates a regular flight to Saint-Denis. However, it should
be noted that the reservations should be made well in advance, possibly early
in May since these flights are often very crowded.  For participants 
who do not want to travel through Paris, they might find direct 
flights to Mauritius
Island, and from there reach Saint Denis with a 20 minutes
flight. There are several daily flights between Mauritius and La
Reunion.  We are currently negotiating an interesting fare with a
travel agent and in the registration form, we will ask you whether you
want to benefit from this fare or not.

The lodging will be ensured from Monday October 15 night to Monday
October 22 morning. We expect that most of the participants will
arrive on Monday October 15 morning and leave on Monday October 22
night. However, the conference will end on Sunday 21 early enough so
that participants may catch the Sunday night flight to Paris (leaving
at 9 PM). Participants can extend their stay in the VVF, either
before, or after the meeting by a few days, at the same price
conditions. Since we must issue a contract with the VVF in order to
secure all the rooms, the cost for the lodging and the meals should
be paid to the organizers at the same time as the registration fees,
3 months before the beginning of the conference. The cost for the
full pension is

		2000 FF  (305 euros) for a shared room
		2700 FF  (412 euros) for a single room

(These prices may change slightly according to the actual attendance)

Transportation from and to the airport will be provided. The cost of
this transportation, as well as of the travel to and from Saint-Denis
University on the first conference day are included in the conference
fees.

For those wishing to extend their stay in the island, the arrangement for
extension should be done on an individual basis with the VVF, with a
mention that the additional stay is linked with the conference.  We
recommend to rent a car, since travel distances for the main scenic sites
are quite long and public transportation is almost non-existent.  All main
rental car companies have local agencies.  Cars may be rented at the
airport and returned in Saint Gilles, or vice versa.  Reservation should be
made in advance to be sure to get a car.  During the conference itself,
there is no need to have a car, since all the transports linked with the
conference will be provided and all the facilities (shops, newspapers,
tobacco, doctors, dentists, ...)  are within walking distance from the VVF.

* SUPPORT

Funds from the European Community are available to provide some
support to a number of participants for attending the conference,
mainly young researchers from the European Community and invited
speakers. A limited amount of extra funds should also be available
from other sources. In any case, support will be distributed on a
case by case basis, upon request. If needed, please fill in the
pre-registration form appropriately.

* SOCIAL EVENTS:

- A welcome drink offered by the Centre de Tourisme de La Reunion
during registration at VVF before the Monday 15th lunch
- A conference opening buffet offered by la Region de La Reunion on
the Tuesday evening in the Saint Denis University
- A one day excursion to the Piton de la Fournaise or to the Cirque de Cilaos
- A conference closing dinner offered by the Conseil General de la
Reunion on Sunday October 22.

The Tourism Office of La Reunion offers two tickets for a helicopter
ride above the island. These will be given to the two winners of the
tombola that we will organize during the registration drink.


* PUBLIC OUTREACH PROGRAMME

The introductory lectures on the first day of the conference (Tuesday
October 16) are meant to provide an up-to-date overview of galaxy
evolution not only for the participants of the conference, but also
for students and professors of related sciences in the Universite de
l'Ocean Indien.

Two open public lectures will be given during the conference, one in
the saint Denis University, the second in a place to be defined in
the southern part of the island.

An open public lecture on galaxy evolution will take place at the
Observatoire des Makes, an observatory for amateur astronomers which is
used for children of the La Reunion schools.  This conference will be
followed by informal discussions between conference participants and the
public and by observations of nearby galaxies and Galactic nebulae with the
telescopes of the Makes observatory.

Schools with a club of astronomy will have the possibility to invite
a participant of the conference for a lecture in the speaker's native
language and for a open discussion.
