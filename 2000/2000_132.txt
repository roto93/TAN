{\LARGE \bf LETTER TO THE EDITORS}

%========================================================================

\bigskip
\noindent
Dear Editors,

\smallskip
In Dwarf Tales issue No.\,3 (31 July 1998) I. Karachentsev and
V. Karachentseva reported a discovery of a new dwarf spheroidal
companion of M31 in the constellation Cassiopeia and named by them
Cassiopeia Dwarf. This galaxy has been the subject of some detailed
study of its resolved stellar population ( Grebel \& Guhathakurta
1999, Tikhonov \& Karachentsev 1999, Aparicio \& Gallart 1999). All of
the authors used one and the same original name of the galaxy.  Now I
recognize that some authors (Caldwell 1999; Blitz \& Robishaw 2000,
and others) prefer ``And VII'' as a new name of Cassiopeia dSph.
Particularly, And VII is indicated as the first name in the NED for
the object. I asked some of them about a reason of their new
preference and heard the response: ``I am getting the impression that this
name is becoming more widely used now.'' The most sophisticated
explanation can be found in the article by Caldwell (1999, AJ, 118,
1230): ``And VI is also called Pegasus dSph, and And VII is called
Cassiopeia dSph by Grebel \& Guhathakurta (1999). I choose to follow
the original naming convention of van den Bergh, who named the
companions for the galaxy host and not the constellations in which
they were discovered (e.g., And II is in fact in Pisces), particularly
as it has been shown that these objects are in fact all at the
distance of M31.''  Following this elegant prescription everybody may
call, for example, LGS 3 and Cetus as ``And VIII'' and ``And IX'' because
these objects are in fact at the distance of M31 (with respect to
us). But I am not sure that such a play with names would be
reasonable. I think the discoverer only has the privilege to name the
objects discovered by her/him.

\medskip
Sincerely,

\medskip
Igor Karachentsev

\bigskip
\bigskip

{\it A comment from the editors:  We note that Peg\,dSph was independently
discovered by Armandroff, Jacoby, \& Davies (1999, AJ, 118, 1220; see also
the editorial in Dwarf Tales \# 3), who named this galaxy And\,VI.  We 
thus believe that for this dwarf both names (Peg\,dSph or And\,VI) are
legitimate.  

However, Cas\,dSph was discovered by Karachentseva \& Karachentsev (1999,
A\&A, 341, 355; see also editorial in Dwarf Tales \# 3) alone.  We agree
with I.D.\ Karachentsev that the discovery group should have the right to
choose a name within IAU naming conventions and expect that this name is
used from then on.  We encourage our readers to respect the discoverers'
prerogative.

\bigskip
\medskip

The Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Cardiff 
invites applications for a postdoctoral research associate position
on a fixed-term contract limited to three years.

You will be working with Dr.\ Jon Davies on galaxy populations in the 
nearby Universe. {}From previous work by the Cardiff group it seems 
clear that there are large numbers of very low surface brightness 
low luminosity galaxies in nearby clusters. This leads to a very 
steep luminosity function consistent with numerical simulations of 
structure formation. If these galaxies have large (M/L) they may 
represent the major mass component of the cluster. Given that 
clusters only represent about 10\% of the galaxy population we now 
wish to study these low luminosity galaxies in other environments, 
i.e., groups and the general field. We have been awarded large 
amounts of observing time to use large CCD arrays and 21cm multi-beam 
instruments and we are actively pursuing more observational data. 
The research group currently consists of 5 researchers (3 postdoctoral 
and 2 postgraduate). You should hold a PhD in Astronomy or related 
topics, or have submitted your thesis before starting the appointment.

The Cardiff astronomy group consists of 12 academic members of staff 
and totals about 45 researchers. Interests range from extra-galactic 
astronomy, to gravity waves and star formation.

Closing date for applications is May 19, 2000.
The start date is as soon as possible.
For informal discussion contact\, Dr. Jon Davies
at the phone number or e-mail address given below.

{\Large \bf Postdoctoral Position in Observational Cosmology}\\
\medskip
{\Large \bf at the University of Bristol, UK}
\end{center}
\bigskip
\medskip

A post-doctoral fellowship is available for three years starting from
August 2000 or as soon as possible thereafter to work on analysis and
follow-up of the INT Wide Area Survey. This is a survey of more than
100 square degrees of sky in several optical passbands to a depth of
approximately r=25 being carried out by a consortium of UK
universities (see http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/~wfcsur/ for more
details). The survey provides an ideal basis for many studies in
observational cosmology and extragalactic astronomy, and it is
expected that the fellow will help define the exact areas of study
based upon their own interests and will take a lead in follow-up
observations.

Applicants should have a PhD in a relevant field of astrophysics,
preferably with experience in image processing and data analysis.  The
post, within the recently expanded Bristol Astrophysics Group in the
Department of Physics, will be for up to 3 years, is on the RA1A scale
and is funded by a grant from the Leverhulme Trust.  Informal
enquiries may be directed to Dr. Malcolm Bremer, Department of
Physics, University of Bristol, Tyndall Avenue, Bristol BS8 1TL, UK
(Tel: 44 (0)117-928-8764; e-mail: m.bremer@bristol.ac.uk).

Applications (quoting reference 6272) consisting of a CV and
description of research interests should be sent to Dr Bremer by 31
May 2000.  Applicants should arrange for two referees to send letters
of reference by the same date.

We have used a large format CCD camera to survey the nearby Fornax
cluster and its immediate environment for low luminosity LSB
galaxies. Recent observations indicate that these are the most dark
matter dominated galaxies known and so they are likely to be a good
tracer of the dark matter in clusters. We have identified large
numbers of these galaxies consistent with a steep faint end slope of
the luminosity function ($\alpha\approx-2$) down to $M_{B}\approx-12$.
These galaxies contribute almost the same amount to the total light as
the brighter galaxies and they have a spatial extent that is some four
times larger.
 
They satisfy two of the important predictions of N-body hierarchical
simulations of structure formation using dark halos. The luminosity
(mass ?) function is steep and the mass distribution is more extended
than that defined by the brighter galaxies. We also find a large
concentration of LSB galaxies around the nearby galaxy NGC1291.

We present the 2-D photometric decomposition of the Virgo galaxy
IC3328. The analysis of the global light distribution of this
morphologically classified nucleated dwarf elliptical galaxy (dE1,N)
reveals a tightly wound, bi-symmetric spiral structure with a diameter
of 4.5\,kpc, precisely centered on the nucleus of the dwarf. The
amplitude of the spiral is only three percent of the dwarf's surface
brightness making it the faintest and smallest spiral ever found in a
galaxy. In terms of pitch angle and arm winding the spiral is similar
to the intermediate-type galaxy M51, but it lacks the dust and
prominent H~{\sc ii} regions which signal the presence of gas. The
visual evidence of a spiral pattern in an early-type dwarf galaxy
reopens the question on whether these dwarfs are genuine rotationally
supported or anisotropic stellar systems. In the case of IC3328, we
argue for a nearly face-on disk (dS0) galaxy with an estimated maximum
rotation velocity of $v_{\mbox{c,max}}\approx 55$\,km\,s$^{-1}$. The
faintness of the spiral and the small motions within it, suggests that
we could be seeing swing-amplified noise. The other possibility is a
tidal origin, caused by the near passage of a small companion.  \par

We studied the statistical methods for the estimation of the
luminosity function (LF) of galaxies.  We focused on four
nonparametric estimators: $1/V_{\rm max}$ estimator,
maximum-likelihood estimator of Efstathiou et al.~(1988),
Cho{\l}oniewski's estimator, and improved Lynden-Bell's estimator.
The performance of the $1/V_{\rm max}$ estimator has been recently
questioned, especially for the faint-end estimation of the LF.  We
improved these estimators for the studies of the distant Universe, and
examined their performances for various classes of functional forms by
Monte Carlo simulations.  We also applied these estimation methods to
the mock 2dF redshift survey catalog prepared by Cole et al. (1998).
We found that $1/V_{\rm max}$ estimator yields a completely unbiased
result if there is no inhomogeneity, but is not robust against
clusters or voids.  This is consistent with the well-known results,
and we did not confirm the bias trend of $1/V_{\rm max}$ estimator
claimed by Willmer (1997) in the case of homogeneous sample.  We also
found that the other three maximum-likelihood type estimators are
quite robust and give consistent results with each other.  In practice
we recommend Cho{\l}oniewski's estimator for two reasons: 1. it
simultaneously provides the shape and normalization of the LF; 2. it
is the fastest among these four estimators, because of the algorithmic
simplicity.  Then, we analyzed the photometric redshift data of the
Hubble Deep Field prepared by Fern\'{a}ndez-Soto et al.~(1999) using
the above four methods.  We also derived luminosity density $\rho_{\rm
L}$ at $B$- and $I$-band.  Our $B$-band estimation is roughly
consistent with that of Sawicki, Lin, \& Yee (1997), but a few times
lower at $2.0 < z < 3.0$.  The evolution of $\rho_{\rm L}(I)$ is found
to be less prominent.

The properties of globular clusters in dwarf galaxies are key to
understanding the formation of globular cluster systems, and in
particular in verifying scenarios in which globular cluster systems of
larger galaxies formed (at least partly) from the accretion of dwarf
galaxies. Here, we revisit the globular cluster system of the dE,N
galaxy NGC 3115 DW1 -- a companion of the nearby S0 galaxy NGC 3115 --
adding Keck/LRIS spectroscopy and HST/WFPC2 imaging to previous
ground-based photometry. Spectra for seven globular clusters reveal
normal abundance ratios with respect to the Milky Way and M31
clusters, as well as a relatively high mean metallicity
([Fe/H]$\approx -1.0\pm0.1$ dex). Crude kinematics indicate a high
velocity dispersion within 10 kpc which could either be caused by dark
matter dominated outer regions, or by the stripping of outer globular
clusters by the nearby giant galaxy NGC 3115. The total galaxy mass
out to 3 and 10 kpc lies between $1\cdot10^{10}$ and
$1\cdot10^{11}$M$_\odot$ and $2\cdot10^{10}$ and $4\cdot10^{11}$
M$_\odot$, respectively, depending on the mass estimator used and the
assumptions on cluster orbits and systemic velocity. The HST imaging
allows measurement of sizes for two clusters, returning core radii
around 2.0 pc, similar to the sizes observed in other galaxies.
Spectroscopy allows an estimate of the degree of contamination by
foreground stars or background galaxies for the previous ground-based
photometry, but does not require a revision of previous results: NGC
3115 DW1 hosts around $N_{\rm GC}=60\pm20$ clusters which corresponds
to a specific frequency of $S_{\rm N}=4.9\pm1.9$, on the high end for
massive dEs. Given its absolute magnitude ($M_V=-17.7$ mag) and the
properties of its cluster system, NGC 3115 DW1 appears to be a
transition between a luminous dE and low-luminosity E galaxy.

I present the first results from a HST/NICMOS imaging study of the
most metal-poor blue compact dwarf galaxy IZw18.  The near infrared
color--magnitude diagram (CMD) is dominated by two populations, one
10-20 Myr population of red super giants and one 0.5-5 Gyr population
of asymptotic giant branch stars.  Stars older than 1 Gyr are required
to explain the observed CMD at the adopted distance of 12.6 Mpc,
showing that IZw18 is {\emph {not}} a young galaxy. The results hold
also if the distance to IZw18 is significantly larger. This rules out
the possibility that IZw18 is a truly young galaxy formed recently in
the local universe.

We examine standard methods of measuring nebular chemical abundances,
including estimates based on direct \te\ measurements, and also
emission-line diagnostics.  We use observations of the LMC \hii\
regions DEM L199, DEM L243, DEM L301, and DEM L323, whose ionizing
stars have classifications ranging from O7 to WN3.  Following common
practice, we assume a two-zone \te\ structure given by \thi\ and \tlo\
to compute ionic abundances.  We compare with photoionization models
tailored to the observed properties of the individual objects, and
emphasize the importance of correctly relating \te\ in the two zones,
which can otherwise cause errors of $\sim$0.2 dex in abundance
estimates.  The data show no spatial variations or local metallicity
enhancements to within 0.1 -- 0.15 dex in any of the objects, notably
including DEM L199, which hosts three WR stars.

Our data agree well with both the modeled $R23$ and $S23$ abundance
diagnostics for O and S.  We present the first theoretical tracks for
$S23$, which are in excellent agreement with a larger available
dataset.  However, contrary to earlier suggestions, $S23$ is much {\it
more} sensitive to the ionization parameter ($U$) than is $R23$.  This
occurs because $S23$ does not sample {\sc S iv}, which is often a
significant population.  We therefore introduce
$S234\equiv$(\sii$+$\siii$+$\siv)/\Hb, and demonstrate that it is
virtually independent of $U$.  Predicted and observed spatial
variations in $S234$ are thus dramatically decreased in contrast to
$S23$.  The intensity of \siv\lam10.5$\mu$ can be easily estimated
from the simple correspondence between \siv/\siii\ and \oiii/\oii.
Using this method to estimate $S234$ for data in the literature yields
excellent agreement with our model tracks, hence we give a theoretical
calibration for $S234$.  Our models show that the double-valued
structure of $S23$ and $S234$ remains an important problem as for
$R23$, and presently {\it we consider calibrations of these S
diagnostics reliable only at $Z\lta 0.5\Zsol$}.  However, the slightly
larger dynamic range and excellent compatibility with theoretical
predictions suggest the S parameters to be more effective abundance
diagnostics than $R23$.

The KPNO International Spectroscopic Survey (KISS) is a new
objective-prism survey for extragalactic emission-line objects.  It
combines many of the features of previous slitless spectroscopic
surveys that were carried out with Schmidt telescopes using
photographic plates with the advantages of modern CCD detectors.  It
is the first purely digital objective-prism survey, and extends
previous photographic surveys to substantially fainter flux limits.
In this, the first paper in the series, we give an overview of the
survey technique, describe our data processing procedures, and present
examples of the types of objects found by KISS.  Our first
H$\alpha$-selected survey list detects objects at the rate of 18.1 per
square degree, which is 181 times higher than the surface density of
the Markarian survey.  Since the sample is line-selected, there is an
imposed redshift limit of z$\simlt$0.095 due to the filter employed
for the objective-prism observations.  We evaluate the quality of the
observed parameters derived from the survey data, which include
accurate astrometry, photometry, redshifts, and line fluxes.  Finally,
we describe some of the many applications the KISS database will have
for addressing specific questions in extragalactic astronomy.
Subsequent papers in this series will present our survey lists of
emission-line galaxy candidates.

Lying at a projected distance of 40\arcmin\ or 9~kpc from the centre
of M31, Andromeda~IV is an enigmatic object first discovered during
van den Bergh's search for dwarf spheroidal companions to M31.  Being
bluer, more compact and higher surface brightness than other known
dwarf spheroidals, it has been suggested that And~IV is either a
relatively old $`$star cloud' in the outer disk of M31 or a background
dwarf galaxy. We present deep HST WFPC2 observations of And~IV and the
surrounding field which, along with ground-based long-slit
spectroscopy and H$\alpha$ imagery, are used to decipher the true
nature of this puzzling object.  We find compelling evidence that
And~IV is a background galaxy seen through the disk of M31.  The
moderate surface brightness ($\bar{\mu_V}\sim$24), very blue colour
(V$-$I$\lesssim$0.6), low current star formation rate
($\sim$0.001~M$_{\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$) and low metallicity
($\sim$10\%~Z$_{\odot}$) reported here are consistent with And~IV
being a small dwarf irregular galaxy, perhaps similar to Local Group
dwarfs such as IC~1613 and Sextans~A.  Although the distance to And~IV
is not tightly constrained with the current dataset, various arguments
suggest it lies in the range 5$\lesssim$D$\lesssim$8~Mpc, placing it
well outside the confines of the Local Group.  It may be associated
with a loose group of galaxies, containing major members UGC~64,
IC~1727 and NGC~784.  We report an updated position and radial
velocity for And~IV.  \par

We present a moderately-deep $JK$ photometry for three selected areas
of the dwarf irregular galaxy IC\,1613.  We acquired our data with the
\lq\lq CAMILA" infrared camera attached to the 2.1-m telescope of the
Observatorio Astronom\'{\i}co National at ``San Pedro Martir", M\'exico
on October 13-15, 1998. Field I is centered on the HII regions in the
north-east quadrant of the galaxy where the most active ongoing star
formation is occurring (Sandage 1971).  Fields II and III were chosen
to be within  the main body of IC\,1613. The color - magnitude
diagrams contain a mixture of red supergiants (RSGs), AGB stars, and
the brightest red giant stars (RGB). Each field contains one or two
stars with $K\approx 13 - 13.5$ and $J-K \approx 1$, which are the
very luminous RSGs, and delineate the peak of the RSG luminosity
function.  In Field I we can see some deficit of stars redder than
$(J-K) \approx 1.0$. A possible explanation for this may be an age
effect --- the stars in Field I are younger than in Field II and III.
The stars between $K = 14.5 $ and $K = 15.5 $ and $ 0.5 < (J-K) < 1.5$
are also RSGs with lower brightness. When $K > 15.5 $ both RSGs and
AGBs stars are present, although there is some color separation
between them --- AGB stars are generally redder than $(J-K) \approx
1.0$.  At the faint limit of the CMDs, but still within the
completeness limit of the photometry, the brighter red giants can be
seen mixed among with the faintest AGB stars.  The superimposed
isochrones from Padua's library (see Bertelli et al. 1994) indicate
that the brightest red supergiants in the three fields are very young
--- about 8 Myr.  Fainter RSGs in IC\,1613 have $M_{K} <-10$ and are
matched very well by a 25 Myr isochrone.  Most of the AGB stars in
Fields II and III are several Gyr old. In Field I most of them are
younger than 1 Gyr. The red supergiants have masses 20 - 25 $M_\odot$.
The derived power-law exponent for the composite (Fields II and III)
LF for magnitude interval $15.5<K<18$ is 0.51$\pm0.04$ in good
agreement with Cole et al.  (1999) slope of V-band luminosity function
down to $V=24.5$.  Using the period-luminosity relation derived by
Madore \& Freedman (1991) and $JK$ magnitudes of the Cepheid variable
V20, we calculated $(m-M)_{K} = 24.37\pm0.2$. The recently discovered
Nova (King et al. 1999) was identified in Field III. Its presence of
our images and its brightness questioned its classification as a nova.

We present {\it Hubble Space Telescope} observations of four cluster
candidates in NGC 6822 originally identified by Hubble (1925, ApJ, 62,
409). One of them, Hubble~IV, is an HII region while Hubble VI, VII
and VIII are confirmed as rich star clusters. Based upon cluster
color-magnitude diagrams from which the field star contamination has
been subtracted, we derive ages of $70\pm10$ Myr for Hubble VI and
$1.5\pm0.2$ Gyr for Hubble VIII. While the age is more uncertain in
the case of Hubble VII, the available evidence argues that this
cluster is probably similar to the old, metal-poor globular clusters
in the Milky Way. Comparisons of the cluster ages and integrated
magnitudes with models of cluster evolution imply that the two young
clusters are an order magnitude less massive than the older cluster
Hubble VII. The radial profiles of all three clusters are reasonably
well-fit by empirical King models. The core radius and central surface
brightness of Hubble VII are consistent with observations of Galactic
globular clusters.  The half-light radii of these clusters are
comparable to values for the inner Milky Way globulars and are on
average smaller than clusters in the Magellanic Clouds. These clusters
apparently are exceptions to the trend noted by van den Bergh (1991,
ApJ, 369, 1) that larger clusters tend to form in environments with
lower stellar densities.

We quantify the amplitude of the lopsidedness, the azimuthal angular
asymmetry index, and the concentration of star forming regions, as
represented by the distribution of the H$\alpha$ emission, in a sample
of 78 late-type irregular galaxies.  We bin the observed galaxies in
two groups representing blue compact galaxies (BCDs) and low surface
brightness dwarf galaxies (LSBs).  The light distribution is analysed
with a novel algorithm, which allows detection of details in the light
distribution pattern.  We find that while the asymmetry of the
underlying continuum light, representing the older stellar
generations, is relatively small, the H$\alpha$ emission is very
asymmetric and is correlated in position angle with the continuum
light.  We show that the concentration of continuum light is
correlated with the H$\alpha$ concentration; this implies that the
young star formation has the same spatial properties as the older
stellar populations, but that these properties are more strongly
expressed by the young stars.  We test a model of random star
formation over the extent of a galaxy by simulating HII regions in
artificial dwarf galaxies.  A galaxy is traced by assuming red star
clusters distributed on an underlying exponential disk of radius twice
the scale length. The disk is allowed to change in apparent magnitude,
scale radius, position angle, and ellipticity.  We compare the
asymmetry-concentration distribution predicted by the simulations with
the real observed distribution; we find that only LSBs match the
distribution predicted by the model.  The reason is that,
independently of the number of HII regions, LSBs show no particular
location of HII regions, whereas BCDs show current star formation
activity restricted very much to the central parts of the galaxies.  A
consideration of the properties of the continuum light leads to the
conclusion that most of LSBs can be approximated by exponential disks
of radius twice their scale lengths; BCDs call, however, for much more
concentrated underlying systems, with smaller scale lengths than
assumed in the simulations.  The implication is that random star
formation over the full extent of a galaxy may be generated in LSB
dwarf-irregular galaxies but not in BCD galaxies.

By means of N-body/hydrodynamical simulations we model the evolution
of a primordial $10^{8}$ solar masses density peak which ends up in an
object closely resembling the present day globular cluster Omega
Centauri. We succeed to reproduce the main features of the cluster,
namely the structure, kinematics and metallicity distribution. We
suggest that Omega Centauri might be a cosmological dwarf elliptical,
formed at high redshift, evolved in isolation and self-enriched, and
eventually fallen inside the potential well of the Milky Way, in
agreement with the Searle-Zinn (1978) paradigm for galactic globular
clusters formation. We finally suggest that Omega Centauri is probably
surrounded by an extended Dark Matter (DM) halo, for which no
observational evidence is at present available. We expect that
signatures, if any, of the DM halo can be found in the kinematics of
stars outside about 20 arcmin.

We have obtained V and I-band photometry for 1886 stars down to $I=27$
and $V=28$ in the field of the dwarf irregular galaxy WLM, using deep
STIS $CL$ and $LP$-band images taken in the parallel mode with the
Hubble Space Telescope. The photometry is used to study the horizontal
branch identified in WLM. The horizontal branch, extending blueward
from the red giant clump, is an unambiguous signature of an old
population.  We demonstrate that it is possible to reach the
horizontal branch of an old population at a distance of $\simeq 1$ Mpc
using STIS, with relatively short exposure times.  {}From the VI
color--magnitude diagram we obtain an accurate distance modulus
$(m-M)_0 = 24.95 \pm 0.13$ for WLM by using the V-magnitude of the
horizontal branch, and by adopting $E(V-I) = 0.03$.  The implications
are: 1) WLM formed stars at high redshift, and 2) the old population
of WLM can be representative of a protogalactic fragment, related to
those accreted to form the Milky Way halo.

We present the results of spectrophotometry and $BVR$ CCD photometry,
as well as integrated H{\sc i} radio measurements of a new blue
compact galaxy (BCG) HS~0822+3542 with extremely low oxygen abundance:
12 + log(O/H) = 7.35, or 1/36 of solar value. The galaxy is the third
most metal-deficient BCG after I~Zw~18 and SBS~0335--052. Its very
high mass fraction of gas ($\approx$ 95\% of all visible mass) and
blue colours of underlying nebulosity are also similar to those of
SBS~0335--052. This suggests that HS~0822+3542 is one of the nearest
and dimmest galaxies experiencing a recently-started first star
formation (SF) episode.  Its properties imply that for such galaxies
there is a linear scaling of the main parameters, at least for the
baryon mass range (0.3--20)$\times$10$^{8}$ $M_{\odot}$.  The total
mass estimate indicates that the galaxy is dynamically dominated by a
dark matter (DM) halo, which itself is one of the least massive for
galaxies.

The results of UBV and H$\alpha$ imaging of a large sample of
 gas--rich, isolated, dwarf irregular galaxies are presented.  The
 majority of the low luminosity systems in this sample have no known
 neighbors within 200 to 400 kpc, and thus are unlikely to have had
 significant interactions within the last several Gyr.  The new
 observations confirm that dwarf Irregular galaxies are blue systems,
 with median values for the sample of 0.42 $\pm ^{0.04}_{0.05}$ in
 (B--V) and --0.22 $\pm ^{0.04}_{0.07}$ in (U--B).  Analysis of the
 derived surface photometry indicates that most of these systems can
 be well fit by single exponential disks, and have only minor color
 gradients.  Furthermore, the observed HII regions are distributed
 sparsely across the optical disk.  HII region luminosity functions
 were constructed for those systems with a sufficient number of HII
 regions; the derived power--law indices are generally shallow, with a
 median value of --1.61 $\pm ^{0.31}_{0.24}$.

We present the first comprehensive catalogue of variable stars in the
Leo II dwarf spheroidal galaxy.  We have identified 148 RR Lyrae type
variables, of which 140 were amenable to derivation of variability
parameters with our data.  We have also confirmed the existence of
four anomalous Cepheids as identified in previous studies.

The average period of the RR Lyrae ab variables (0.62 days), the
fraction of c variables (0.24) and the minimum period of the RR Lyrae
ab variables (0.51 days) all define Leo II as an ``Oosterhoff
intermediate" galaxy.  We have used the properties of these variables
to derive a metallicity for Leo II of approximately [Fe/H]=-1.9.  We
attempt to resolve discrepancies between this value and those
determined by previous efforts.  The presence of longer period, higher
amplitude RR Lyrae variable implies a metallicity distribution that
extends to as poor as [Fe/H]$=-2.3$.

Leo II's location on the period-metallicity relation of clusters, like
that of other ``Oosterhoff intermediate'' objects, falls between the
Oosterhoff Class I and Oosterhoff Class II clusters.  The properties
of the variable populations of these objects are consistent with the
idea that the Oosterhoff ``dichotomy" is a continuum.  The gap between
the classes seems to be explained by the horizontal branch of Galactic
globular clusters shifting a way from the instability strip at at
intermediate metallicities.  However, Leo II, as well as other
Oosterhoff intermediate objects, has a second parameter effect strong
enough to leave horizontal branch stars in the instability strip.

\medskip

We show that the gas in growing density perturbations is vulnerable to
the influence of winds outflowing from nearby collapsed galaxies that
have already formed stars.  This suggests that the formation of nearby
galaxies with masses less than approximately $10^9 M_\odot$ is likely
to be suppressed, irrespective of the details of galaxy formation.  An
impinging wind may shock heat the gas of a nearby perturbation to
above the virial temperature, thereby mechanically evaporating the
gas, or the baryons may be stripped from the perturbation entirely if
they are accelerated to above the escape velocity.  We show that
baryonic stripping is the most effective of these two processes,
because shock-heated clouds that are too large to be stripped are able
to radiatively cool within a sound-crossing time, limiting
evaporation.  The intergalactic medium temperatures and star-formation
rates required for outflows to have a significant influence on the
formation of low-mass galaxies are consistent with current
observations, but may soon be examined directly via associated
distortions in the cosmic microwave background, and with near-infrared
observations from the Next Generation Space Telescope, which may
detect the supernovae from early-forming stars.

Two giants of the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal have been observed with
the UVES spectrograph on the ESO 8.2m Kueyen telescope, during the
commissioning of the instrument.  Sgr 139 has [Fe/H]$=-0.28$ and Sgr
143 [Fe/H]$=-0.21$, these values are considerably higher than
photometric estimates of the metallicity of the main population of
Sgr.  We derived abundances for O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr,
Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Y, Ba, La, Ce, Nd and Eu; the abundance ratios found
are essentially solar with a few exceptions: Na shows a strong
overdeficiency, the heavy elements Ba to Eu, are overabundant, while Y
is underabundant.  The high metallicity derived implies that the Sgr
galaxy has experienced a high level of chemical processing.  The stars
had been selected to be representative of the two main stellar
populations of Sagittarius, however, contrary to what expected from
the photometry, the two stars show a very similar chemical
composition.  We argue that the most likely explanation for the
difference in the photometry of the two stars is a different distance,
Sgr 143 being about 2\,kpc nearer than Sgr 139.  This result suggests
that the interpretation of colour -- magnitude diagrams of Sgr is more
complex than previously thought and the effect of the line of sight
depth should not be neglected.  It also shows that spectroscopic
abundances are required for a correct interpretation of Sgr
populations.

We examine the observational consequences of the two possible origins
for irregular galaxies: formation from collapse of a primordial cloud
of gas early in the age of the Universe, and formation from tidal
tails in an interaction that could have occurred any time in the
history of the Universe.  Because the formation from tidal tails could
have occurred a long time ago, proximity to larger galaxies is not
sufficient to distinguish tidal dwarfs from traditional dwarfs. We
consider the effects of little or no dark matter on rotation speeds
and the Tully-Fisher relationship, the metallicity-luminosity
relationship, structure, and stellar populations.  {}From these
selection criteria, we identify a small list of dwarf irregular
galaxies that are candidates for having formed as tidal dwarfs.

We present Keck 10-meter/LRIS spectra of candidate red giants in the
halo of M31, located at a projected radius of R=19kpc on the minor
axis. These spectroscopic targets have been selected using a
combination of UBRI-based and morphological screening to eliminate
background galaxies. Radial velocity measurements are used to separate
M31 halo giants from foreground Milky Way dwarf stars, M31 disk stars,
and residual background galaxies. The metallicity of each M31 halo
giant is measured using standard photometric and spectroscopic
techniques, the latter based on the strength of the CaII triplet. The
various [Fe/H] estimates are in rough agreement with one another. The
data reveal a large spread ($>2$dex) in [Fe/H] in M31's halo; there is
no strong radial [Fe/H] gradient. LRIS and HIRES spectra are also
presented for red giants in five dwarf spheroidal satellites of M31:
AndI, AndIII, AndV, AndVI, and AndVII.  There appears to be a
significant metallicity spread in AndVI and possibly in AndI. The new
radial velocity data on these outer dwarfs are used to constrain the
total mass of M31: the best estimate is under $10^{12}$\msol, somewhat
less than the best estimate for the Milky Way.

Since the chemical evolution of galaxies seems to differ between
morphological types and deviates in many details from the standard
scenario the question has to be addressed when, how and to what amount
metal-enriched ejecta from Supernovae and Planetary Nebulae pollute
their environment. Since recent observations of dwarf galaxies show no
significant metal abundance gradients throughout the galaxies while
enhancement of metals happens in isolated HII regions, an effective
mixing process has to be assumed.  Chemodynamical evolution models can
provide a possible explanation by demonstrating that strong
evaporation of gas clouds by hot gas and following condensation leads
to an almost perfect mixing of the gas.  We focus on the different
phases of chemodynamical evolution that are experienced by a
representative dwarf irregular galaxy model and present a quantitative
analysis of the chemodynamical gas flow cycles.

The Multibeam survey at the Parkes Radio Telescope has provided a
wealth of 21 cm HI data. We have mosaicked ten standard HIPASS cubes
to produce a datacube approximately 25 deg x 25 deg in size, centred
on NGC1399, the optical centre of the Fornax Cluster. Some properties
of the initial approx. 80 galaxies identified in HI are described.  In
the optical, Ferguson's Fornax Cluster Catalogue (FCC) identified 340
likely member galaxies in the central 40 sq.deg. In the radio we have
detected a more uniform sheet of about 80 galaxies at the cluster
velocity extending up to 15 deg from the cluster centre. At the
cluster distance of about 15 Mpc, this corresponds to an elongated
large-scale structure (LSS) more than 7 Mpc in extent.  Galaxies were
detected to a lower mass limit of $1 \times 10^8$ \msol\ and fewer than 25 of
these were within the central 40 sq.deg, suggesting considerable HI
depletion of galaxies in the centre of the cluster. Further, these
results strongly indicate that HI surveys do not readily identify
galaxy clusters.

The star formation histories of Local Group galaxies are summarized.
The three large spirals are briefly discussed individually.  The discussion
of the Local Group dwarfs concentrates on differences and commonalities.
While Local Group galaxies exhibit an amazing diversity in their star
formation histories even within the same morphological type, they share a
number of common global properties.  Major determining factors for their 
evolution are galaxy mass and environmental effects such as ram pressure
and tidal stripping.  It seems likely that low-mass dwarf irregular galaxies
evolve into dwarf spheroidals.
