Subject: 2MASS Second Incremental Data Release

Dear Colleague:

The Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) Second Incremental Data Release is 
now available for public access.  This Release includes data from the
northern and southern 2MASS facilities, covering 47% of the sky.
The Release data products consist of a Point Source Catalog containing 
positions and photometry for over 162 million objects, an Extended Source 
Catalog containing positions, photometry and basic shape information for over 
585,000 resolved sources, approximately 1.9 million compressed 512x1024 pixel 
(1"/pixel) images in the three Survey bandpasses, and non-compressed 
"postage-stamp" images for all of the Extended Source Catalog objects. 

The release data products can be accessed on-line from the IPAC/2MASS Web site 
at http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/2mass/ or directly from the NASA/Infrared 
Science Archive site at http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/.  In the near future, 
the release Catalogs will be available via ftp download, and on a limited 
distribution DVD-ROM.  Access to the 2MASS Atlas Images is currently possible 
only via the on-line services.

The 2MASS/IPAC webpage contains general information about this data release, 
including an on-line Explanatory Supplement 
(http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/2mass/releases/second/doc/explsup.html), 
sky coverage maps, images of interesting objects in the release, catalog 
characteristics, etc.  A tool for determining whether a specified position 
is included in the release area is available on the NASA/Infrared Science 
Archive webpage.  Questions about the release can be directed to the 2MASS 
Help Desk at 2mass@ipac.caltech.edu.

We encourage you to notify us (at 2mass@ipac.caltech.edu) about any 
refereed publications or conference proceedings (even in preprint form) 
which make use of these or earlier 2MASS Release data products.  We will gladly 
provide links to your papers from the 2MASS website.  Thank you very much 
in advance.

of Massachusetts and the Infrared Processing and Analysis Center.
