MEMORANDUM


To: 	   12 Meter Users

From:  	   P. Vanden Bout

Subject:   12 Meter Poll


The NRAO is attempting to do what it can to help current users of the 
12 Meter utilize other millimeter/sub-millimeter telescopes following the 
closure of the 12 Meter at the end of the current observing season, July 
2000.  

We do plan to investigate the possibility that some organization or group 
wishes to operate the 12 Meter as an astronomical facility.  At the 
present time we are unaware of any such organization or group, but it is 
important to confirm this before proceeding further.  The next step would 
be to call for proposals from the operators of other millimeter/sub-millimeter
telescopes for the use of 12 Meter instrumentation.  Items of 12 Meter
instrumentation could be placed by the NRAO on indefinite loan to telescopes
that were judged to make the most advantageous use from the perspective of 
current 12 Meter users who might then go to that telescope for their 
observations.

In addition, we are considering establishing a program of support for 
outside users of university millimeter/sub-millimeter telescopes similar 
to that for users of the 12 Meter, that is, partial support of travel and 
page charges.

To help guide us in our decisions, your participation in the following 
poll would be appreciated.  Please answer by return email to 
brodrigu@nrao.edu, adding any comments or suggestions you feel would be 
helpful.  The results of the poll will be available for further comment 
and discussion when it is complete. 

1.  Which capabilities of the 12 Meter are unique to your requirements, 
    compared to other telescopes?

2.  Which of the following comes closest to satisfying those requirements: 
    FCRAO 14m, SMT 10m, CSO 10m, OVRO array, BIMA array; JCMT 15m,
    Onsala 20m, IRAM 30m, SEST 15m?

3.  Which, if any, of the capabilities you need are lacking for this 
    telescope (answer to Question 4)?

4.  Could this capability be provided by an item of equipment from 
    the 12 Meter?

5.  Was the 12 Meter program of partial support of travel and page 
    charges important to your ability to conduct your research program?  
    Would a program like it be necessary if you were to continue your 
    program at another telescope?

6.  What is your position (faculty, postdoc, student, . . .)?  
    Institution?  

7.  If faculty, are you supervising a student whose research depended 
    on the availability of the 12 Meter?  If so, what is the stage of the 
    student's research? 
 
8.  What are the funding sources for your research (NSF or NASA 
    grant, university, . . .)?

9.  Were a summer course to be offered on the use of mm interferometers, 
    would you be interested?

10. Additional comments and suggestions?
