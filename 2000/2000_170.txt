Subject: Changes to the Cycle 10 HST Proposal Process

Dear Colleagues:

We wish to announce two significant changes to the Cycle 10 proposal
process.

It now appears that servicing mission SM3B will likely occur as
late as (or later than) November 1, 2001, well into Cycle 10.
The earliest possible GO observations on the new instruments
(ACS and NICMOS) would then be in ~March 2002. We can ensure that ACS
and NICMOS science will still be scheduled as early as possible by 
using the Cycle 11 review (notifications expected on or before December
2001). 

Therefore we have decided, in consultation with the HST Project and the
Chairs of the Users Committee and the STIC, that while WFPC2, STIS, and
FGS will continue to be available:

   ***** ACS and NICMOS will not be offered in Cycle 10. *****

We estimate that at most 600 orbits would have been available,
and that science will be better served by having those ACS and
NICMOS proposals chosen in late 2001 rather than this coming fall.
GTO observations in the Cycle 10 catalog will be protected against
duplication even if ACS deployment is delayed until Cycle 11 (see
section 5.2 of the CP for details).

Another important change  will be the unavailability of the Aft Shroud
Cooling System (ASCS) during Cycle 10. Hence, 

   ***** there will be no STIS NUV MAMA low dark current campaigns *****

(this supersedes Section 4.3.4 of the Call for Proposals).

Based on the presently projected SM3B date, we expect Cycle 10
to start on July 1, 2001 and to include a full year of observations
minus the ~2-3 month cost of the servicing mission including
verification. If the present schedule holds, there may be fewer 
WFPC2/STIS/FGS opportunities toward the end of Cycle 10, as observations 
with the new instruments, ACS and NICMOS, ramp up and fewer than a 
full year of orbits may be allocated (depending on information available 
at the time of the Cycle 10 TAC in November 2000).

We regret we were unable to announce this in the Call for Proposals
issued last month but the information was (and is) still evolving.
ACS and NICMOS proposals will be solicited for Cycle 11, which has
a nominal deadline in September 2001. Meanwhile, proposers can choose
the best science without resorting to strategic games regarding
instrument choice.

We will keep you informed should further significant changes occur
prior to the proposal deadline.

Best wishes,
Steve Beckwith
Director, STScI
