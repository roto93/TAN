Dear Colleague:
    We have established an email exploder called "gbtnews" for the
dissemination of information about the new Green Bank Telescope.  You
should have just received a notice for the first call for Early Science
proposals for the GBT.  In the future, such proposal calls will come
through gbtnews, which will also contain GBT status reports, milestones
achieved, the availability of new instruments or capabilities, and other
such announcements.  This information will also be posted on the NRAO web
pages (www.nrao.edu).

To be placed on the gbtnews distribution list, you must subscribe to it,
which is a two-step process.  First, send email to 

	majordomo@majordomo.cv.nrao.edu

In the body of the email (not in the subject line), enter the line

	subscribe gbtnews

You will then receive an email authentication notice asking you to confirm
that you wish to join gbtnews.  Follow the instructions, which ask you to
reply with the lines listed in the body of the email, which are of the
form

	auth <code> subscribe gbtnews \
        your_email_address

No further general distribution emails on the GBT will come to you if you
do not subscribe to gbtnews.  If you wish, you can unsubscribe from
gbtnews at any time according to the instructions provided.  News on the
GBT will also appear in the NRAO Newsletter (issued quarterly) as well as
on the NRAO web pages.
