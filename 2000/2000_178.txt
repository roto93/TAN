Hi Everybody, 

For this thursday cospa meeting, if you need a lunch box, please 
send an email request directly to Ms. Huang at Taida. 
Her email address is "chhuang@phys.ntu.edu.tw".   

And I would like you to know one change made about the lunch-box 
arrangement.  So far Emily at IAA has taken pains to count the 
number of people who need lunch boxes, and order lunch boxes 
for us.  But, from now on, Celia will take over this job.
Her email address is "celia@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw". 
Let us thank Emily for her all pains and supports so far, and 
thank Celia who was willing to take this job for us. 

Whenever I announce the cospa meeting, I will let you know 
to whom you should send your request of a lunch box.
