ANNOUNCEMENT

It has been understood since the proposal to build the Millimeter Array
(now the Atacama Large Millimeter Array) that the 12 Meter Telescope
would someday be closed.  We had hoped to operate the 12 Meter until
interim ALMA operations were achieved.  More recently, indications of
budget troubles suggested that it would be prudent to plan for a closure
earlier than that, and a process had begun to study the impact of a loss
of 12 Meter operations that would lead to an orderly closure.  With the
announcement by the NSF of their 2001 budget request, we are forced to
cut that process short.

I regret to announce that the 12 Meter Telescope will be closed at the
end of the current observing season, July 2000.

Following a long series of stagnant budgets for the Observatory, another
shortfall in the funds required to operate the NRAO in 2001 cannot be
absorbed and at the same time properly maintain operations of the Very
Large Array, Very Long Baseline Array, and new Green Bank Telescope.  We
are forced to reduce the scope of our activities by taking this step. 
								
The NRAO Tucson staff have been notified.  We will be working with them
over the next few months to arrange transfers to ALMA and other
Observatory positions where possible, and to assist them in securing
other employment where necessary.

The Observatory will immediately begin consultations with the
astronomical community to assess the scientific impact of the 12 Meter
closure and seek advice on mitigating steps that might be taken.  We
will be consulting with other millimeter observatories regarding
observing time that could be made available to 12 Meter users.  Plans
for the disposition of the 12 Meter and its instrumentation will follow.
