  Sources and Scintillations: Refraction and Scattering in Radio Astronomy
  
                    17-21 April in Guiyang, China
                              hosted by
      FAST Laboratory, National Astronomical Observatories, CAS, China 
         
      ****************************************************************
      >> Deadline for abstracts and early registration: 15 February <<
      ****************************************************************
 
Subject and goals:
  
Irregularities in the Interstellar Medium both refract and diffract radio
waves, causing a variety of observable effects on the received radio signals. 
These effects influence our view of all compact radio sources -- from pulsars
and masers to supernovae, gamma-ray bursts and quasars -- and give information
on the media through which the radio-waves propagate, from the ionosphere to
the inter-galactic medium.

In this conference our goal is to bring together specialists in the diverse
astronomical fields where propagation plays a role. This cross-fertilisation
will be timely as scintillation and scattering phenomena are being revealed
in an increasing variety of ways. We will address the latest developments in
both the theory and observations of refraction and scattering in an
inhomogeneous medium.


Topics in the Preliminary Scientific Programme include:
-------------------------------------------------------
  Evolution of compact radio sources: gamma-ray bursters and SNe
  Micro-arcsecond imaging
  Intraday variability
  Physics of high brightness temperature radio sources
  Origin of circular polarisation in AGN
  Imaging and astrometry in the presence of strong scattering
  Sgr A* and the Galactic Centre
  The ionised interstellar medium: dynamics and distribution
  Pulsar scintillation
  Propagation in pulsar magnetospheres
  Giant pulses
  The Crab pulsar
  Multiple imaging and Extreme Scattering Events
  Ionospheric and interplanetary propagation
  Square-Kilometre Array: Science drivers and technical requirements
 
 Speakers will include: Don Backer*; John Baldwin; Jim Cordes; Mike Davis;
   Ron Ekers; Peter Goldreich; Yashwant Gupta; Carl Gwinn; Dave Jauncey;
   Andrew Lyne; Don Melrose; Barney Rickett; Stefan Wagner; Mark Walker

  ____________________________________________________________________________

Venue:

  The conference will be held in the southwestern Chinese province of Guizhou,
  a region somewhat off the beaten path (but with good air and rail connections
  to the main cities of China) yet with its own special attractions. Its
  limestone geological structure, with the most extensive karst formations in
  the world, gives the province an unimaginably striking landscape. In this
  unique karst region Chinese astronomers hope to build an Arecibo-type
  reflector whose diameter would be as much as 500 m.

  The conference location is a hall in the city, near the hotels (see below),
  several restaurants, shops and not far from one of the city parks with a
  lake, boat rides, roaming monkeys and other attractions. For weather
  information, see our homepage.
  ___________________________________________________________________________  

Registration (NOTE CHANGE OF EARLY DATE):

  Register, as soon as possible, preferably by filling in the form on our
       web site (http://www.bao.ac.cn/IAUC182/)
  Early registration and abstract deadline: 15 February 2000
  Registration fee: $ 140 (early); $ 170 (after 15 February 2000)
       (see the web site for preferred methods of payment)
  ___________________________________________________________________________ 

Accommodation:

  Three hotels, within a few minutes' walking distance of the meeting hall,
       have been chosen for participants. Prices range from about $ 20 to
       $ 80 per night, for single or double occupancy. Please fill in the
       accommodation form on our homepage to reserve your room (no deposit
       required).
  ___________________________________________________________________________ 

Other activities:

  There will be a conference dinner on Tuesday April 18, offered by the
       province of Guizhou, and hosted by the governor. There will also
       be a reception at the beginning of the conference, and an excursion
       one afternoon to visit the karst region, including a trip to the
       magnificent Huang Guoshu Waterfall. (These activities are included
       in the registration fee.) We will also organize daily sightseeing
       excursions for accompanying persons. Anyone interested in travel
       before or after the conference is encouraged to contact the LOC
       for suggestions and advice.
  ___________________________________________________________________________

Travel:

  Foreign participants will probably arrive at Beijing, Guangzhou (Canton),
       Hong Kong or Shanghai. From there, they can fly directly to Guiyang
       city on one of the domestic airlines. (From Hong Kong there are
       flights only two days a week, but there is a shuttle bus to the nearby
       border with Shenzhen, from where one can go by taxi or other means
       to its airport, which has a daily service to Guiyang.) Round-trip
       prices range from about $ 300 - $ 500 (see "Travel" under the Venue
       section of the homepage; there is also some information at the
       following web site: http://www.caft.com/e_default.htm), though it is
       probably best to consult your travel agent.
       Rail travel is also possible (and cheaper). It takes about a day and
       a half - again consult our homepage for information, or the LOC.

Proceedings:

  We intend to publish the proceedings, probably as a special issue of
       Astronomy & Astrophysics Supplements.
