Dear Colleague/Recipient

An advertisement for the Bolton Fellowship, a postdoctoral position at the 
ATNF, follows. Please post it and/or pass it on to anyone who may be 
interested. My apologies if you receive more than one copy of this notice.

Yours sincerely,

BOLTON POST-DOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP

Applications are invited for the Bolton Fellowship, a three-year 
post-doctoral appointment tenable at the major Australia Telescope National 
Facility locations. Bolton Fellows are encouraged to undertake research 
and/or development in any area relevant to ATNF observational capabilities. 
The ATNF facilities provide unique opportunities to observe the Southern 
sky including the Magellanic Clouds and the richest part of our Galaxy.

The ATNF, a Division of CSIRO and Australia's premier radio astronomical 
facility, has its Sydney Headquarters at the Radiophysics Laboratory and 
operates the Parkes 64m telescope, the Narrabri 6km Compact Array and the 
Mopra 22m telescope near Coonabarabran. The Compact Array operates in the 
20cm, 13cm, 6cm and 3cm bands. It is currently being enhanced for operation 
in the 12mm and 3mm bands and to have north-south baselines. Among other 
receivers, the Parkes telescope has a 13-beam focal-plane-array receiver 
system operating in the 20cm band, primarily for HI and pulsar surveys. 
With other Australian and overseas antennas, the ATNF telescopes operate as 
a VLBI array which uses the broad-band S2 recording system. The 
Headquarters site is shared with CSIRO Telecommunications and Industrial 
Physics (formerly CSIRO Radiophysics) and the Anglo-Australian Observatory, 
which operates the 4m Anglo-Australian and Schmidt optical telescopes near 
Coonabarabran.

The Fellowship is named in honour of John Bolton FRS, a pioneer of radio 
astronomy who made the first identifications of extragalactic radio sources 
and who worked at the CSIRO Radiophysics Laboratory between 1947 and 1981.

Applicants must have (or will shortly satisfy the requirements for) a PhD 
degree in astronomy, astrophysics or related disciplines. The commencement 
annual salary is in the range $A47K to $A51K plus benefits. A relocation 
allowance is payable. Bolton Fellows also receive a discretionary research 
allowance of $A20K over the three-year term.

Applications should include a curriculum vitae, list of publications, 
statement of proposed research or development ideas, and the names and 
addresses (preferably email) of three referees, and should be mailed to The 
Director, ATNF CSIRO, P.O. Box 76, Epping NSW 1710, Australia or emailed to 
postdoc@atnf.csiro.au. The closing date for applications is December 1, 2000.

For further information on the ATNF and the Fellowship, see the ATNF web 
pages at http://www.atnf.csiro.au or contact Dr. R. N. Manchester, email: 
rmanches@atnf.csiro.au, fax: 61-2-9372-4310, or at the above address.
