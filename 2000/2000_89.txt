Call for Proposals: MERLIN
--------------------------
The deadline for proposals for Semester 00B on MERLIN is April 9, 2000.  
All details are in the MERLIN web area, specifically:

                http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/merlin/propsub/call

MERLIN will be offering all three standard frequencies for 00B 
(1.4/1.6 GHz, 5 GHz and 22 GHz). L-Band will be available at the start 
of the session. The timing of the change to C/K-Band will be determined 
by user demand and the MERLIN TAG's view of the proposed science. There 
will be only one change from L-Band to C/K-Band. It is planned to have 
a joint MERLIN + EVN session at L-Band in November 2000. Applications 
for such observing time should be submitted to the EVN (see below). 

Proposal forms, information on MERLIN Key Programmes, and further general 
information can be obtained via:
                            
            www:   http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/merlin
            ftp:   ftp.jb.man.ac.uk, Directory: /pub/merlin/proposals
            email:   merlin@jb.man.ac.uk

Proposers should note that we are approaching the maximum of sunspot 
activity in this present solar cycle. Associated ionospheric disturbances 
can result in rapid phase changes across the MERLIN array particularly 
at longer observing wavelengths. At L-Band, large and rapid phase 
fluctuations on baselines longer than ~70 km can defeat standard phase 
calibration procedures for perhaps 30% of the time. For stronger sources, 
such phase errors are recoverable by self-calibration, but those proposing 
for weak target sources may wish to request additional time to compensate 
for anticipated losses, although a ~30% loss in long baseline data only 
results in a sensitivity degradation of ~12%. This situation will improve 
once solar maximum has passed.

C-Band observations are less degraded by this ionospheric activity. 
Proposers might consider using the shorter wavelengths at this point 
in the solar cycle, delaying, where possible, deep L-Band observations of 
weak targets for a year or so until the ionospheric activity subsides.


Call for Proposals: European VLBI Network
-----------------------------------------

The next VLBI proposal deadline is June 1, 2000. All details may be found 
in the EVN USERS GUIDE at:

                 http://www.jive.nl/jive/evn/evn.html

Potential users of the European VLBI Network should read the recent 
Announcement of Opportunity, which describes the award of a grant from 
the European Commission's Access to Research Infrastructure Programme. 
This grant is designed to support access to the EVN and is available to 
astronomers at EU (or Associated States) institutes that are not 
affiliated to the EVN institutes. More details can be obtained at:

Director's Report
-----------------

The National Facility budget was received from PPARC shortly after the 
publication of the last Newsletter and, as seems to be the fashion these 
days, it did not leave us in a comfortable situation. PPARC were, 
unfortunately, not able to provide all of the short-term band-aid that 
was promised and so we have had to implement some austerity measures. 
Such measures may affect our ability to provide the professional level 
of service that our users expect but we ask that you bear with us.

As was mentioned in the September 1999 Newsletter, the National Facility 
will be reviewed this coming autumn. It has been decided to have a full 
International Review and the review panel will have broad terms of 
reference. The panel will consist of senior and respected radio astronomers 
from around the world. 

Now to the good news - late last year it was announced that the University 
of Manchester had been successful in its application for about £2 million 
from the Joint Infrastructure Fund to upgrade the 76-m diameter Lovell 
Telescope.  The upgrade will consist of the replacement of the telescope 
surface, a new control system and refurbishment of the track and 
foundations.  The work will take place over the next three summers and 
should be complete by late 2002. Once completed the telescope is expected 
to have significant gain at 10 GHz. It will be a very welcome addition 
to MERLIN at 5 GHz and, when combined with upgrades of the MERLIN 5 GHz 
receivers (a project currently underway), will triple the sensitivity 
of the array at that frequency.

We welcome Barry Maguire to the National Facility staff as an aips++ 
programmer. Jodrell Bank was one of the founding members of the aips++ 
consortium. Unfortunately, due to constraints on resources, it was 
forced to withdraw from the consortium a few years ago. However, with 
the recent release of the first public version of aips++, it was felt 
that the National Facility and Jodrell Bank Observatory should be 
participating in the new generation of astronomical data processing 
software. Therefore, we have rejoined the consortium and hired Barry. 
His first job will be to ensure that MERLIN data can be read into aips++ 
and calibrated.

Recent Science:  MERLIN captures radio flare from X-ray transient 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
XTE J1859+226
-------------

On October 11, 1999, the Rossi XTE satellite discovered a bright new 
transient X-ray source, XTE J1859+226 (Wood et al. 1999). Subsequent 
X-ray observations (Markwardt et al. 1999) revealed variability 
characteristic of an accreting black hole, and an optical counterpart 
was rapidly identified (Garnavich et al. 1999). Two days after the 
initial discovery, radio observations at 15 GHz with the Ryle Telescope 
(RT) in Cambridge detected a radio counterpart subsequently confirmed 
with the VLA (Pooley & Hjellming 1999). At this point, our MERLIN override 
for radio-bright X-ray transients was triggered and a series of 
observations were made at 1.7 GHz.

Following detection of the radio counterpart to the X-ray emission as 
a weak (<10 mJy) source on Oct 14 and 15, the rise, peak and decay of 
a bright radio flare event from the system was recorded on October 16 
This is one of the clearest observations of a radio flare event from 
an X-ray binary ever made, in particular in its coverage of the rise, 
which is notoriously difficult to catch. It almost certainly corresponds 
to the ejection of a large mass of material from the system, probably at 
relativistic velocities. Ongoing observations of this exciting source 
with XTE, CGRO and at radio wavelengths with a host of ground-based 
observatories, including MERLIN, the VLA, GBI, RT and the EVN promise 
further insight into the relation between accretion and ejection in 
black hole binary systems. MERLIN observations of this source and those 
of others, such as GRS 1915+105 (Fender et al. 1999), are crucial in 
understanding the physics of such systems.

Engineering Work: 
-----------------
Replacement and commissioning of the new telescope drive system
---------------------------------------------------------------

Three of the MERLIN telescopes, Darnhall, Knockin and Pickmere were 
built over 20 years ago to the same design as the NRAO VLA telescopes. 
Part of the MERLIN Restructuring Grant was assigned to replace the 
original Electrospace Systems Inc. drives and control systems with 
modern reliable equipment, keeping all of the functionality of the 
existing system and at the same time increasing the monitoring and 
control facilities available.

Darnhall was selected as the first telescope to be changed. As reported 
in the previous Newsletter, the summer of 1999 saw all the original 
control equipment, motors and limit switches removed and replaced. At 
the same time, the opportunity was taken to install new distribution 
equipment along with power and lighting circuits in the pedestal room. 
All cabling on the site was examined and rationalised.  Due to the 
retirement of the Electrical Workshop Supervisor, the installation of 
the cabling was placed with contractors. Our staff installed the 
motors and limit switches, and made the connections to the control 
computer.

Overall, the project went well. The shaft of the new motors was slightly 
longer than that of the old system and had to be modified but otherwise 
the motors were a direct replacement. The drives and control equipment 
for the new motors have behaved well since they have been installed 
although there are a small number of outstanding items that are still 
to be resolved. This work will be completed shortly. The control computer 
software has been significantly upgraded, as has the interface between 
the computer and the new system.

Darnhall is currently participating in the Semester 00A observations at 
5 and 22 GHz and appears to be working well. Preparations have started 
for the changes to the remaining two telescopes this summer. 

National Facility Radio Imaging School, 25-28 April, 2000
---------------------------------------------------------

The imaging school will introduce prospective MERLIN and EVN users to 
basic interferometry and give a taste of more elaborate techniques and 
future developments for experienced radio astronomers.  About 1/3 of 
the time will be spent in practical computing, reducing sample data sets. 
Model data reduction routines for continuum and line observations covering 
MERLIN and EVN data will be available.

An announcement concerning the school was sent to various mailing lists, 
it proved so popular that within a week of the initial announcement it 
was oversubscribed. There will be 45 attendees in total, 16 from overseas. 
The agenda and other information is available at 

                   http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/merlin/school

Sessions on basic data reduction will be given by National Facility and 
EVN staff and Jodrell Bank Observatory personnel. There will also be 
guest speakers who will discuss some of the science currently performed 
by MERLIN and the EVN and will also look towards the future. Guest 
speakers and their topics include: Karen Wills (Sheffield) on 'HI 
absorption'; Stewart Eyres  (LJMU) on 'Novae: interpreting weak, variable 
structure'; Katherine Blundell (Oxford) on 'Radio galaxies: what are we 
looking for?'; Jeremy Yates (Herts) on 'High-frequency interferometry' 
and  Rob Fender (Amsterdam) on 'X-ray counterparts and other faint 
variable sources'. 

We thank the EVN for contributing to the travel costs of some delegates 
to this school through their EC programme 'Access to Large Scale 
Facilities: the European VLBI Network and JIVE'.  We apologise to those 
who inquired about the school but were unable to get a place. We hope to 
make the lecture notes and model data reduction routines available after 
the school. Please visit the web site or contact us (Anita Richards: 
amsr@jb.man.ac.uk; Tom Muxlow: twbm@jb.man.ac.uk) if you are interested 
in obtaining them.

The MERLIN archive
------------------
                  
                 MERLIN archive data access policy

'It is the policy of the MERLIN/VLBI National Facility that the 
investigators named on a MERLIN proposal have the sole right of access 
to the data obtained for that proposal for one year after the end of the 
Semester in which the observations were made. If the data are part of a 
programme with long-term status then the investigators have sole right 
of access to all the data of that programme for one year after the end of 
the Semester in which the final set of observations were made. 

An astronomer wishing access to data from the archive after the period 
defined above should make a request in writing to the Director of the 
National Facility (pdiamond@jb.man.ac.uk). Under normal circumstances, 
the PI will be contacted to determine if there is a valid reason for an 
extension to the one-year time limit.

With the impending arrival of a web-based archive, the policy will be 
reviewed at the next meeting of the MERLIN/VLBI National Facility Steering 
Committee.'

In the September 1999 Newsletter, the appointment of Dr. Anita Richards as 
the NF data archivist was announced. Anita's principal job is to generate 
an archive of calibrated data and images for all publicly accessible MERLIN 
data. This is a major task and the archive will be made available in stages 
as appropriate. As stated above the data access policy will be reviewed at 
the next meeting of the Steering Committee.

One immediate benefit to users is a new service that we are providing for 
rapid access to MERLIN data taken as part of joint MERLIN/EVN observations. 
We can provide the amplitude calibrated uv data in FITS format, suitable 
for imaging and combining with EVN data.  This can usually be done on a 
timescale similar to the correlation of the EVN data; about half a dozen 
PIs have used this service to date, a slightly larger number preferring 
to visit Jodrell (or arrange for a co-worker to visit) to reduce the data 
from scratch. Please contact Anita (amsr@jb.man.ac.uk) concerning this 
particular service.
