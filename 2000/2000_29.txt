  1- LOCATIONS
  ================================


   The registration, the poster exhibition, the coffee breaks and all
   talks will be at the new campus of the University of Heidelberg, address:

   Im Neuenheimer Feld
   Building 308
   69120 Heidelberg, Germany

   A local map will be available on our webpages.
   Here are some:

   Mannheim-Heidelberg region:
               http://www.uni-heidelberg.de/univ/besucher/region.html      
   Heidelberg - city and campus region:
               http://www.uni-heidelberg.de/univ/besucher/heidelberg.html
               http://www.uni-heidelberg.de/univ/besucher/heidelberg2.html

   The conference takes place in a building north of ``Mensa'' in this map.
   Note also at bottom of map ``Hauptbahnhof'' = main train station.

   Campus ``Im Neuenheimer Feld'' - detailed map:
               http://www.uni-heidelberg.de/univ/besucher/karten/6307.gif
   
   The audience hall is adjacent to the little pond (blue color) visible on
   the map next to the black circle.

   The registration desk will be opened on
   Sunday 19.3.                     6 pm - 10 pm
   Monday 20.3. - Friday 24.3.      8 am - 6 pm

  2- ARRIVAL
  ================================

   Railway:  Heidelberg can be reached by ICE, IC, and Interregio (IR) trains.
      The next main traffic junction is Mannheim at a distance of only 20km.
      Very often there is a good long distance connection by rail to Mannheim.
      From there you can get frequent local rail services to Heidelberg
      (duration 10-20 minutes, frequency about 30 minutes, inquire at station
      to find correct platform and trains).

   Airplane: The next airport is Frankfurt/Main, though Stuttgart airport
      is not much further away and also connected by rail. From Frankfurt
      airport there are good train connections to Heidelberg (in most
      cases via Mannheim), which cost about 25 DM one way, plus
      varying supplements depending on train type. Note that Frankfurt
      airport now has TWO train stations, which are separately signposted,
      and both have ticket offices:

      i) the long-distance train station (rather long walk, still some
         construction going on, don't get confused...), during daytime all
         long-distance trains (such as ICE, IC, IR) leave from there, for
         example there are direct trains to Mannheim.

      ii) the regional train station (this is in fact the old train station,
         and it is just a short walk, down to the basement in front of
         terminal 1, concourse B of the airport):
         there you find frequent local trains (S-Bahn and others) to Frankfurt
         Hauptbahnhof (city main station), and during the night ALL trains
         depart from here.

      iii) there is also a convenient Lufthansa-airline shuttle bus to the
           Heidelberg Marriott hotel (from there one gets by taxi in
           max. 10-15 minutes to all other Heidelberg hotels).
           The bus cost one way DM 36,--, booking is possible on the spot
           at the driver, or with the flight ticket. Timetable at:
           www.frankfurt-airport.de/en/travel_planner/arrive_depart/bus/
                                                           airline_shuttle.html
      iv) There is also a special minibus shuttle transfer directly to
      your hotel (TLS-Minibus-Shuttle-Company) (45,-- DM; booking with the hotel
      necessary).

   Car: By car you may come from the motorway (Heidelberger Kreuz) in the
      direction 'Kopfkliniken' or 'Neuenheimer Feld' or 'Zoo'. There is
      sufficient parking space at the campus. Traffic congestion during
      working days on all motorways around Heidelberg/Mannheim and Frankfurt
      is normal.

  3- LOCAL BUS/TRAM
  ================================


      The central exchange is Bismarckplatz in the city center (30 min walk to
      the campus). The nearest stop to the campus and the conference
      site is 'Bunsengymnasium' (7 min walk to the conference place).

     From the main train station (Hauptbahnhof) directly to the conference
     site (campus) you take (both leaving the tram station heading to the west):

      Bus number 33 joins the main train station (Hauptbahnhof) and touches
          the campus from the backside (hospital area, youth hostel and zoo).
      Tram no. 4 Hauptbahnhof - Bunsengymnasium (direction Handschuhsheim)


     Trains and buses heading to the east from the railway station lead in
     most cases to Bismarckplatz, e.g.

      Tram no. 1 Hauptbahnhof - Bismarckplatz (direction Handschuhsheim)
      Bus No. 41/42 Hauptbahnhof - Bismarckplatz (direction Universitaetsplatz)

      AVOID tram no. 4 (direction Rohrbach Sued) - this is WRONG direction!

     From Bismarckplatz and old city centre to the conference site on campus:

      Bus number 12 joins the old city centre and the campus via Bismarckplatz.
      (Universitaetsplatz - Bismarckplatz - Bunsengymnasium)


      Single tickets cost 3.50 DM.
      There are congress tickets at 6,-DM per day and weekly tickets of 27,-DM,
      which will be available at the registration desk.

      A tourist map will be available on our webpages.


  4- CATERING
  ================================


      A possibility to use the university canteen 'Mensa' for lunch will be
      arranged.
      There are a few cafes and restaurants very near on the campus. A list is
      available via the webpages.
      For dinner there are many restaurants and pubs in the
      old city center.

  5- TECHNICAL INFORMATION
  ================================


     The next post office is near the railway station (20 min walk).
     Another one is close to Bismarckplatz (behind the Horten department store)

     A bank with cash dispensers is on the campus (building 370). There are
     more nearby. Most cash dispensers accept major cards (credit or ec cards).

     There are also a copy shop and some other shops.

     Public phones (with coins or card) are also available nearby (building
     307). Phone Cards of DM 12,-- or DM 50,- value may be a convenient
     investment, available in shops and post offices (also at the airport).

  6- SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMME
  ================================

     This is the preliminary program, minor changes are possible.
     The updated version of the program is available on our webpage
     http://www.ari.uni-heidelberg.de/star2000/program.html

                  SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMME

Electronic publishing (EP) is considered nowadays as a hot
subject. A whole colloquium would be necessary to discuss the
various aspects and to review the situation on the EP front.
In the limited framework of this paper, a few broad ideas will
be brought up and basic concepts introduced in order to put EP
in context. References and access keys for further
documentation/readings are given in the bibliography.

There will not be much about astronomy itself. However it is
obvious that the matter at hand will have an enormous impact
on our life and on the way we do science. The field is in
permanent evolution. Things that were looking as `wacky' a
couple of years ago are now part of the common landscape.
Advances in various fields (telecommunications, technologies,
methodologies, concepts, sociology, and so on) have to be
closely followed and one has to be prepared for whatever is
coming up.

Some astronomy publishers have already made a few steps in the
direction of EP, but still a lot has to be done if we wish to
speak of proper/real EP and not only of merely
computer-assisted traditional publishing or of traditional
publishing with an electronic mirror.

Not so long ago, we were still using mechanical typewriters,
talking over noisy telephone lines (sometimes hard to get!)
and relying on postal services in order to work and publish.
It might seem we have always lived with electronic mail.
The omnipresent World-Wide Web (WWW) is only about four years
old. Four years!
