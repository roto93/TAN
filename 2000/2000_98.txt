<<  NEWSLETTER # 1>>       http://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/newsletter.html
This is the first issue of a newsletter which is to appear about three
times a year for presenting new features of the CDS services. 
The first issue is sent by e-mail to all registered SIMBAD users 
provided we know their e-mail address. If you want to be REMOVED from
the mailing list, hit REPLY and type REMOVE in the subject. 
If you want to be added to the mailing list, please visit the URL given

<< SIMBAD >>         CDS, France          http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/
                     US mirror (CfA)   http://simbad.harvard.edu/
The SIMBAD reference database now includes 7.5 million identifiers for 
2.7 million objects. In addition to the daily updates from the
literature, major recent inclusions are the new compilation of uvby 
photometry (measurements) and the Tycho Catalogue (TYC and GSC 
identifiers).  Improved filtering functionalities are being
implemented progressively.

<< VizieR >>         CDS, France          http://vizier.u-strasbg.fr/
                     US mirror (ADC) http://adc.gsfc.nasa.gov/vizier/

                     India (IUCAA)      http://urania.iucaa.ernet.in/
The Tycho-2 catalogue of the 2.5 million brightest stars and the
9th edition of Veron & Veron's catalogue of "Quasars and Active 
Galactic Nuclei" have been made recently available. 
Watch also recent developments concerning very large catalogues: 
USNO A2.0, near infrared sources (DENIS and 2MASS), etc.
The list of recently added catalogues and tables can be viewed at URL

<< Aladin >>                              http://aladin.u-strasbg.fr/
The Aladin interactive Sky Atlas now provides access to DSS-II plates, 
in addition to first epoch DSS-I, and to higher resolution MAMA scans. 
Links to remote archives (such as HST) are also included. 
The Java interface has been upgraded and a standalone version supporting 
access to local FITS images is available from the Aladin Web site.

<< Mirrors >>
CDS now hosts a copy of the INES (IUE) database at:
   http://godot.u-strasbg.fr/ines/
Links to the IUE archive are present in SIMBAD and ALADIN.
