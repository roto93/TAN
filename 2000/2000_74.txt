Subject: 12-m closure: two action items

Dear 12 m users and other concerned astronomers:

	As you are undoubtedly aware, the NRAO announced very recently
that the 12-meter telescope will be closed on July 31 of this year.  We
feel that the closing of the 12-meter telescope is a terrible
development and must be prevented.

	The 12-meter telescope is important for the following reasons:

	*It is extremely well instrumented for mm-wavelengths.  It is the
only telescope in the world having continuous coverage from 70 to 300
GHz, allowing study of the J = 1-0 and J = 2-1 transitions of CO and
many other molecules such as CS, CH3OH, HCO+, CH3CN, etc.

	*These molecules are the best probes of astrochemical and
astrophysical conditions in dense interstellar and circumstellar
regions.  This science is not just a radioastronomical niche, but is
generally important for many areas of astrophysics.  The current plans
for the ALMA array, a major project, attest to this importance.

	*A large number of astronomers ( > 170) use and depend on this
telescope for their research, primarily because of the excellent
instrumentation and the accompanying operational support.  Over the past
5 years, users of the telescope have produced about 35 papers per year
with its data.  Other telescopes duplicate some of the capabilties of
the 12-m, but not all.  Nor are they set-up to accomodate the general
user community.

	*The 12-m closure, together with the long lead time for ALMA,
will make mm-wave observational astronomy an unattractive option for
graduate students in the next five to ten years.  This is disturbingly
like the situation in cm-wave astronomy over the past six to eight
years, the effect of which was to greatly reduce the influx of younger
people into the field.  A similiar situation arose when the KAO had to
be closed in order to pay for SOFIA; as a result, today, very few
U.S.-based graduate students are trained in the techniques of
far-infrared astronomy and the U.S. has lost its presence in the
field.  Such situations are unstable and can decimate a field in the
worst case.  With ALMA on the horizon, this country should be
maintaining and increasing our activity in mm-wave astronomy--not
decreasing it.  When ALMA becomes a reality it will be appropriate to
close the 12-m, but not before.

FOR THESE REASONS, WE PROPOSE THE FOLLOWING:

	We believe that in unity there is strength.  We propose to form
a group of concerned astronomers whose voice will argue with reason and
persistence for the continued operation of the 12-m.

	Specifically, we will argue for a temporary emergency
appropriation earmarked for its continued operation by the NRAO until a
more permanent funding arrangement can be worked out, which perhaps
could involve another institution operating the telescope.

	A large, unified group cannot be ignored because it can gain
publicity in the following ways: with astronomers, through the AAS; with
the scientific public, through magazines like Nature and Science; with
the general public, through news media; with the government, through
institutions such as the NSF.

	The co-signers of this email have spontaneously come together in
the last two days because of their concern.  We are sending this email
to a self-generated list if 12-m users; the list is certainly
incomplete.  Please distribute this to anyone you think would be
interested.

	And most importantly, perform the following two simple acts:

	1.  If YOU are concerned about the 12-m, let the following
people know as soon as possible:

	Hugh van Horn; (703)-306-1820; hvanhorn@nsf.gov
	Bob Dickman; (703)-306-1822; rdickman@nsf.gov
	Paul vanden Bout; (804)-296-0241; pvandenb@nrao.edu
	Riccardo Giacconi; (202)-462-1676; giacconi@aui.edu


	2.  If YOU are interested in joining us, let us know ASAP by
return email to...
