> ... Coming This Way ...
>
>   The venue will be the Howard Beach Resort in Kenting at the very
> southern tip of Taiwan.  By now you should have booked your flights
> either to the CKS Airport (the main international airport near
> Taipei, in the north of the island) or to the KHH Airport (the
> domestic/international airport in Kao-Hsiung, to the south of the
> island).  If you have not booked the CKS to KHH portion of the trip,
> the daily scheduled flights from CKS to KHH are:
>
>   CI 191 (07:25 am), BR 901 (09:00), CI 193 (12:35), BR 907 (18:30),
>   CI 195 (19:00), EG237 (19:05), CI 197 (21:40), and BR 911 (22:50).
>
> and for reservations:
>   CI=China Airlines, USA: +1-800-227-5118    TWN: +886-2-2715-1212
>   BR=EVA AIR,        USA: +1-800-695-1188    TWN: +886-2-2501-1999
>
>   These flights are for international transfers only, and the flying
> time is about 50 minutes.  Note the big time gap between the 12:35
> flight at noon and the 18:30 flight in the early afternoon.
>
>   If for some reason a connection from CKS to KHH is not possible
> for you, an alternative is to take an airport shuttle from CKS to
> the domestic airport inside Taipei City (the Sung-San Airport).
> This will take you 50 minutes backwards geographically (north-bound)
> but the flights to KHH are far more frequent (every 30 minutes).
> If you are taking this route, you will pass the immigration check
> and customs.  Once you leave the customs and enter into the reception
> lobby, go to your ***left*** to the end of the building where the
> shuttle station is.
>
>   On January 3, upon arrival at the KHH Airport, you will be guided
> to take the bus to the Howard Beach Resort in Kenting.  The bus ride
> takes about 2 hours, and brings you directly to the front of the
> hotel.  The bus fare costs NT$250 (or about US$8).
>
> *** 1 US dollar is about 32 New Taiwan dollars. ***
> *** Please look for our desk in the lobby of the KHH Airport. ***
>
>   Some of you will arrive on Jan 2 and choose to stay overnight at the
> campus Guest House (NT$800 per night) of the National Central
> University before continuing the journey next day.  The campus is
> a 20-minute drive from the CKS Airport.  Please let us know if you want
> us to reserve a room at the Guest House on your behalf.  Also contact
> with us if you would need someone to pick you up at the CKS Airport
> and drive you to the campus.  On Jan 3, there will be buses for the
> NCU students and staff to go to Kenting.  If you so desire you may
> get a ride, but be warned that the trip will usually take more than
> 8 hours.

> ... The Scientific Program ...
>
>   The program is too long to duplicate here.  Please refer to
>      www.astro.ncu.edu.tw/iauc183/sci_prog.htm
> for listing.  Please note that all invited and contributed
> oral presentations are each 20 minutes long.  This is to maximize
> the number of talks, thus the possible interaction off the stage.
> Still, the time slots are limited so a few oral papers have been
> asked to change to poster presentations.  Forty six oral papers
> are scheduled.  An overhead, slide and computer projector will
> be available.  Those who demand special equipment please contact
> us.  There will be Internet setup at the meeting.
>
>   In the first evening (Jan 4), there will be a forum for scientists,
> engineers and vendors to meet to exchange ideas of mutual interest
> and to discuss on the recent development of telescope technology.
>
>   Poster papers are divided into two sessions, Jan 4 to 5, and
> Jan 6 to 8.  The schedule is deliberately arranged so that
> posters get to be put up for sufficient time, and get to be
> read during breaks.  There will be two slots of time devoted
> for poster run-downs.  Each poster paper will be given 3 minutes to
> show no more than 1 overhead transparency to present the essentials
> of the work.
>
>   Information concerning the proceedings publication will be given
> at the conference.
>
> ... Excursions and Others ...
>
>   January 6 is off for a one-day excursion to the Kenting National
> Park, free of charge to all registered participants.  In addition,
> there are 5 half-day guided tours for spouses and participants to
> explore the variety of places near Kenting.  You are supposed to
> pay for your own expenses for these (nominally a few hundred NTDs).
>
>   For your information, there will be another workshop for astronomy
> education in parallel for high school teachers between Jan 6 and 8,
> exclusively to take advantage of IAUC183!  You no doubt will encounter
> them inside Howard, and please, talk to them, and share your
> experience and enthusiasm.
>
>   January in Kenting is generally comfortable (~20C).  It may be
> windy though near the beach so a light jacket is needed.
>
> ... When It Ends ...
>
>   The meeting ends Jan 8 at noon.  The buses back to NCU will leave
> right after lunch, and again, will take more than 8 hours back to
> the campus.  The campus, as noted above, is well located for
> departure from the CKS Airport.  You will be given a chance to sign
> up at the Registration Desk if you want to take the ride.
>
>   The return flights from KHH to CKS:
>
>     CI 192 (06:30), BR 902 (06:50), CI 194 (10:20),
>     CI 196 (14:25), BR 912 (16:00), CI 198 (19:10),
>     BR 910 (20:15)
>
>   If you have any questions or need any assistance, please do not
> hesitate to let us know.  Please forgive us if we have made some
> confusion or overlooked something.  Let me assure you that we
> are striving to make the conference enjoyable and scientifically
> rewarding.
>
>   See you soon in Kenting.
