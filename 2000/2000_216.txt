Call for Early Science Proposals for the Green Bank Telescope.

Deadline for receipt:  1 December 2000

The Green Bank Telescope saw first light at 403 MHz on August 22.  Commissioning
will begin soon at low frequencies (< 5 GHz).  The frequency limit will rise
steadily, and should reach 50 GHz within one year, with plans for 100 GHz
operation within two years.  The NRAO will schedule a small number of early
science projects during the commissioning process as the observing capability
and frequency range permit.  These projects should utilize one of the unique
capabilities of the GBT -- unblocked optics, large fully-steerable aperture,
active surface and metrology systems, wide bandwidth spectrometer, and Quiet
Zone location -- and should offer the possibility of significant and unique
scientific results.

This special call for proposals is intended for experienced observers willing
and able to perform observations in a commissioning environment.  Only a very
few proposals will be chosen to illustrate each new capability, and
participation in this call carries no implication of future priority or claim-
staking for an idea, project, or area of research.  Further calls for proposals
aimed at a wider audience will be made in 2001 as significant classes of
capabilities are fully commissioned, and all proposals will be considered on an
equal basis at that time. 

This call offers the opportunity for very early results from the GBT, but
carries with it a number of important conditions.  As the proposals will be
executed at the earliest possible time during the commissioning process,
observing systems will not be mature. The observations may require a lengthy
on-site visit by the observing team, and will require a high degree of
participation by the staff.  Observations are likely to be interspersed with
commissioning tasks. 

Proposals for this call may be for frequencies up to 50 GHz and may include
spectroscopy, continuum, pulsar, and bi-static radar reception observations. 
Unique VLBI proposals will be entertained and will be forwarded for
consideration within the VLBA system at the appropriate deadline.  All proposals
will be refereed by a peer-review panel, evaluated by a scheduling committee,
and selected on the basis of appropriateness, feasibility, scientific merit, and
experience of the observing team.  The proposals will be scheduled as the
capability becomes available; thus, it may take up to one year before the
early science queue is completed. 

General information on the call for Early Science proposals may be found at
	http://www.nrao.edu/GBT/proposals

A description of the observing capabilities of the GBT and a proposal
preparation guide may be found at

	http://www.nrao.edu/GBT/proposals/short_guide.html

All proposals must be submitted using the NRAO Proposal Submission Tool, which
may be downloaded from

	http://www.nrao.edu/GBT/proposals/tool.html

The deadline for receipt of proposals is 1 December 2000, with the earliest
possibility of scheduling in the first quarter of 2001.  Questions concerning
the logistics of proposal submission and scheduling may be addressed to Carl
Bignell (cbignell@nrao.edu), and scientific questions relating to GBT observing
capabilities may be addressed to Ron Maddalena (rmaddale@nrao.edu).
