Subject: JENAM2000 Dynamics Sub-Meeting S02



                        J E N A M - 2000
            Moscow, Russia, May 29 - June 3, 2000

                 Special Second Announcement
                 ---------------------------
  FOR THOSE INTERESTED IN S02 Morphology and dynamics of stellar systems:
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
                               star clusters, galactic arms and rings
                              ----------------------------------------

  Dear colleagues, in the spirit of the past ``P-5'' (dynamics sessions)
 at JENAM-98 (Prague) and JENAM-99 (Toulouse) we kindly ask for your attention
 to a similar meeting organized at JENAM-2000 in Moscow. In excess to
 the formal registration procedure the organisers of :

======================================================================
S02. Morphology and dynamics of stellar systems: star clusters,
galactic arms and rings
(A.Chernin, F.Combes, G.Gilmore, R.Spurzem);
contact: <chernin@sai.msu.ru>, <francoise.combes@obspm.fr>.
======================================================================

 would appreciate if you could let us know as soon as possible about your
 intention joining / giving a talk / presenting a poster related to S02,
 just by an informal email with title and/or abstract. From your responses 
 we will compile a preliminary scientific program of S02, and
 update you on that shortly before the deadline at March 15.
 
 Thank you very much for your attention,
 and looking forward to see you in Moscow,

 A.Chernin, F.Combes, G.Gilmore, R.Spurzem

=======================================================================

 PLEASE BE ADVISED THAT ANY COMMUNICATION WITH US IS INFORMAL AND SHOULD
 HELP ORGANISING THE SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMME OF S02. Even if we agree to
 include you in the preliminary programme of S02, YOU STILL HAVE TO
 FOLLOW THE STANDARD PROCEDURES FOR THE MAIN JENAM-2000 REGISTRATION.

========================================================================
 In the following we forward for you a package of forms and informations,
 as they are provided from the main organisers of JENAM2000, and a 
 more detailed agenda for our S02 meeting.

If you plan to attend, please first remember important dates and forms:

*March 15, 2000: deadline for early (reduced) registration fees payment
(moved onward from Feb. 29 which was indicated in the 1st Announcement);
*March 15, 2000: deadline for abstract submission and financial
assistance requests.
*************************************************************
The participants should complete some or all of the following
 three forms:
  1.    Registration form
  2.    Visa support form
  3.    Payment form.
**************************************************************

 Here is the more detailed agenda of S02:
======================================================================
S02. Morphology and dynamics of stellar systems: star clusters,
galactic arms and rings
(A.Chernin, F.Combes, G.Gilmore, R.Spurzem);
contact: <chernin@sai.msu.ru>, <francoise.combes@obspm.fr>.

 Recent advances in the high precision measurements of radial velocities,
 proper motions and parallaxes have opened important ways for better
 understanding of the origin, dynamics and evolution of star clusters.
 Such three-dimensional kinematic measurements allow for the first time
 direct comparison with observations as well as with recent models
 obtained from high-performance computer simulations. Fascinating dynamical
 questions for fundamental processes such as gravothermal oscillations,
 mass segregation and the interplay between tidal fields, shocks (disk
 passages of clusters) and internal evolution have to be answered, before
 such observational and theoretical studies will enable us to use globular
 clusters as a detailed fossil record of galaxy formation.
 Further study of the subsystem of globular clusters may provide direct
 constraints on the theories of structure formation on galactic scale.
 Progress in the studies of open clusters may give new keys to the
 distance scale in the Galaxy and clarify the nature of star formation
 in gas/star complexes of the galaxy disks. It has also been realized how
 important are spiral arms and other density waves such as rings in
 the disks: they are developed by spontaneous gravitational instabilities
 or induced by galaxy interactions, and are the brightest elements of galaxy
 morphology and main drivers of secular evolution of stellar systems.
 Through gas compression by shocks that form in their potential wells,
 they trigger ongoing large-scale star formation. Through angular
 momentum transfer, they allow mass to concentrate, to form bulges,
 and late-type galaxies to evolve into earlier types, along the Hubble
 sequence. It is with the studies of arms and rings that deeper insight
 in galaxy morphology and dynamics is expected, yielding the spiral pattern
 geometry and speeds, as well as the true nature of waves in both stars
 and gas distributions. Given the increasing sensitivity and spatial
 resolution of observations (HST, NGST and NIR with VLT or in the radio mm
 interferometers, ALMA, etc.), exchanges/discussions are very welcome to
 confront theory, simulations and observations.


==========================================================================


  Here follow forms and other hints to help you for registrations:
 (as supplied by main organisers)

           

* Registration form. You can submit it through the Web-page
