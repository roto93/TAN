                       MERLIN Call for Proposals
                    Semester 01A, Feb 2001 - July 2001
 
                        Deadline October 9 2000


Normally, we would issue the Call for Proposals as part of a MERLIN/VLBI
National Facility Newsletter. However, as you are probably aware the 
National Facility is being reviewed later this month by an international 
panel and so we have decided that it would be preferable to delay the
publication of our Newsletter until shortly after the review. So, please
look out for it at that time.

As you are also aware the Lovell Telescope is being upgraded, courtesy of
a JIF award of approximately 2 million pounds. The upgrade is being done
during the summers of 2000-2002 and is expected to be complete towards 
the end of 2002. This summer has seen the refurbishment of the telescope 
foundations and the replacement of a significant portion of the track. It
is expected that the telescope will be back in operation, on schedule, 
in the next few weeks. However, as a result of this heavy engineering work
there will be less time available for L-band in the coming semester.
Proposers may also have noticed that due to heavy pressure on MERLIN L-band
time with the Lovell Telescope there has been less C and K-band time
available in recent semesters. Semester 01A offers an opportunity to redress
this imbalance and so proposers are invited to make use of this major
C and K-band session.

You can find the formal call for proposals and more information on the
web at:

                   http://www.merlin.ac.uk/propsub/call

Note our new homepage:

                        http://www.merlin.ac.uk

There are planned MERLIN + EVN observations at C-Band in February/March 
and May/June 2001. Applications should be submitted to the EVN in the normal
manner. Information can be found at:
