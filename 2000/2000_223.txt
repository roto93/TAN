Dear TAN members, 

  This serves as a reminder to you to register for the 
IAU Colloquium 183 on "Small-Telescope Astronomy on 
Global Scales" to be held January 4 to 8, 2001 in Kenting, 
Taiwan.  

  The official registration deadline was october 15, and 
we have come to realize that some of you, who may 
want to participate, yet have not registered for the meeting. 
So far more than 170 people have registered---it bounds to be 
a busy and interesting meeting indeed.  

  Please take your earliest convinient time to register and 
make your room reservation on the website 

   www.astro.ncu.edu.tw/iauc183.  

  I look forward to seeing you in Kenting.  

  Regards, Wen Ping
