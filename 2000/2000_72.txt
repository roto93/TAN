                 SECOND ANNOUNCEMENT

      32nd EGAS CONFERENCE, Vilnius, July 4-7, 2000



GENERAL REMARKS
---------------

The 32nd EGAS Conference is an Europhysics Conference of the European
Physical Society. However, scientists from non-European countries
are strongly encouraged to participate in this conference. It is
aimed primarily at atomic physicists, astronomers and physical chemists,
but will also be of value to scientists in other areas who use
spectroscopy in their work. Representatives from the industry and
publishers are invited to contribute relevant displays to an exhibition.

The scientific programme of the conference will cover all aspects of the  
structure and spectroscopy  of atoms, ions (highly charged ions included) 
and small molecules. It will include applications to laser physics, low and 
high temperature plasma physics, astrophysics, medicine, industry, 
environment and other fields as well as developments in technology and 
instrumentation. Special attention will be paid to laser light interactions with 
atomic and molecular species, to optical lattices, to atomic tests of
fundamental theories, to coherent and non-linear phenomena, ions in traps 
and laser manipulation of atoms, short-lived, "ultracold", "hollow" and 
"exotic" atoms, atomic fountains, parity non-conservation, Bose-Einstein  
and Fermi-Dirac condensates, quantum cryptography and teleportation.

National currency litas (LTL) is tightly bound to USD (1 USD = 4 litas).
All payments in Lithuania are allowed only in litas.

Before April 30, 2000, the registration fee will be 190 Euro for individual 
members of EPS, or members of European National Physical Societies, 200 
Euro for non-members of EPS, and 130 Euro for students. After April 30, 
2000, the amount will be raised up to 230 Euro for regular participants and 
140 Euro for students.

Registration fees may be paid by cheque or money transfer in Euro. The 
cheque in Euro  must be payable to the Institute of Theoretical Physics and 
Astronomy, A. Gostauto 12, LT-2600 Vilnius, LITHUANIA.

SOCIAL PROGRAMME
----------------

Monday evening (July 3)        Registration and Welcome Party
Wednesday afternoon (July 5)   Excursion to Trakai
Thursday (July 6)              Conference Dinner

For the Excursion to Trakai  on Wednesday afternoon a participation
fee of 20 Euros per person ( including transportation by bus  and
English-speaking guide) will be charged and it should be paid with
registration fee to confirm your reservation.
Trakai is the former capital of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania
situated at the distance of 27 km west of Vilnius. The red brick
14th century castle situated on a tiny  island in the middle of
lake will leave you an unforgettable memory.

On Saturday (July 8) the traditional EGAS post-conference all day tour will 
be  proposed. A trip to Kaunas, a second largest city of Lithuania, including 
a visit to an open-air Country life museum in Rumsiskes will take place. 
Rumsiskes is located 18 km east of Kaunas between the Kaunas-Vilnius
motor way and the Kaunas Basin. The museum exhibits the past ways of 
living in Lithuania. Entire exhibitions and artefacts from towns, villages and 
farmsteads from all over Lithuania have been brought to this place and 
reassembled. The price will be approximately 50 Euros, including 
transportation by bus, lunch and English-speaking guide and should be also 
paid with registration fee to confirm your reservation.


ACCOMPANYING PERSONS
--------------------

The following preliminary programme for accompanying persons will
be arranged:

Tuesday (July 4)    Guided excursion to Vilnius University,
                    Sightseeing tour
Thursday (July 6)   Visits to Vilnius Planetarium (including
                    the meeting with craftsmen),
                    Gediminas Castle and Excursions to  Museums or
                    Park of Europe
Friday (July 7)     Excursion to  Antakalnis Memorial and TV Tower

The fees depend on the number of participating persons and will not be
known before the end of May. The fees will be indicated in the
Third Announcement and on the WebSite.
Various concerts, shows and other cultural activities will take place
in Vilnius, in July.


GENERAL ASSEMBLY AND ELECTIONS

The General Assembly will be held during the EGAS Conference in Vilnius
on Thursday July 6, 12 h. All participants are kindly invited.
Any delegate attending the conference is entitled to participate
in the General Assembly.

   The affairs of EGAS are managed by a Board of fifteen members, who
are elected by the General Assembly at the annual conference.  Any
delegate attending the conference is entitled to participate in the
General Assembly.  Each Board member is elected for a term of three
years and is then eligible for re-election for a second term.  Usually
Board members do not serve beyond six years.  An attempt is made to
achieve a reasonable regional balance in the Board membership, but it
is important to realise that the Board members are not elected simply
to represent their own nations.

At the conference in 2000 at Vilnius five members of the Board will
retire by rotation.  One of these (Fernande Vedel) has served three
years and is eligible for re-election. The Board recommends that she
should be re-elected.  The other four (Baudon, Griffith, Huber and
Mannervik) are not eligible.  We are seeking nominations for their
replacement.  In order to maintain the geographical balance of the
Board we are particularly encouraging nominations from France, the
United Kingdom, the Nordic countries, Spain and Portugal.
Nominations should be sent to the Secretary, Professor Fernande Vedel
(e-mail: fern@frmrs12.u-3mrs.fr) to be received by the 1st June 2000.
Board members should be closely associated with one of the fields of
work covered by EGAS.  They should expect to attend the annual
conferences and a Board meeting in November each year.
They should also note that EGAS cannot normally cover the costs of
travel. Please ensure that any candidate that you nominate is willing
to serve, if elected.
  If necessary, an election will be organised at the conference.
