Subject: 12m Closure


TO THE 12M USER COMMUNITY:

  You all have received the "12 M POLL" by now. One should be aware that this
is only an appeasement meant to divert you from voicing your opinion. The
powers that be want you to think they are going to do something for you.
What they really want you to do is keep quiet so they can carry out their
agenda.The best thing they could do is keep open the 12 m in the
first place. University facilities cannot do the job of the 12m, and you
will never get time at the IRAM 30 m (especially given the current
difficulties at the Plateau de Bure).

  Paul Vanden Bout has promised many things to the mm-wave community in
the past. Take some past quotes from his letters:

Letter dated March 2, 1990, to the members of the radio panel:

"The merits of continuing to run the 12-meter until the MMA is
operational are clear. It also keeps NRAO in the millimeter-wave
game, which is important to the success of the MMA."

What is he doing now ?

Letter dated March 14, 1990, to "Dear Colleague":

"I believe that the upshot of all of this [1990 12 m fight] is much
improved prospects for the MMA over the situation of one year, or only
six months ago. With solid support from the astronomical community,
we really do have a chance to begin using the MMA by, or even before,
the turn of the millennium."

The millenium is here, and where is ALMA ?

This not the time to close the 12m. It may be the time to take a serious
look at the way in which NRAO is spending the astronomy community's
precious NSF dollars.

Please continue to write letters, make phone calls, send e-mails to the
NSF, to AUI and to NRAO at the addresses below.
