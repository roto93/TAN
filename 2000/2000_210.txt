Hi Fred,
I thought you might be interested in this announcement.
Cheers, Erick

    First Light on the Magellan I 6.5 Meter Telescope

First light was achieved with the Walter Baade 6.5 Meter telescope at
Las Campanas Observatory on
September 15, 2000. The CCD guide camera at one Nasmyth instrument port
captured the image of
NGC 6809 with an effective 20 second unguided exposure and no filter.
Representative PSFs ranged
from 0.52 to 0.55 arc-second FWHM.

Since the guide camera was used to take the images, long guided
exposures were not possible. A
second guide camera and science grade CCD camera will be added in
October permitting longer
exposures. Initial results are that the open- and closed-loop tracking
performance are very good.

The thermal stability of the borosilicate primary mirror is critical for
good imaging performance. The
images were obtained on the evening following initial start-up of the
thermal control system for the
primary mirror. Air is blown into the cavities of the mirror at near
ambient temperature to maintain its
equilibrium. The set point for the air was adjusted manually on this
night but in the future will be
controlled automatically.

The active optic correction of the primary mirror figure and adjustment
of the telescope collimation were
done by inspection of the out-of-focus images on the guide camera
monitor. Early in October this
process will be automated using the Shack-Hartmann wavefront analyzers
in the guider assembly.
