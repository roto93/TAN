Dear Cospa members,

In my previous announcement, I announced that the 8/24 cospa meeting 
would be held at IAA. 
But, on 8/24, there will be the SMART workshop at IAA, 
which causes a time conflict with our cospa meeting.

Thus, the place for our 8/24 cospa meeting is changed to Taida. 

I am sorry if it causes any confusion. 

Here is a new announcement:
 

                 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
                 *         T A I D A  &  A S I A A         *
                 *                                         *
                 *        J O I N T    S E M I N A R       *
                 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
