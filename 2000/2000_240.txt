Faculty Positions in Astronomy
National Central University
Graduate Institute of Astronomy
Chung-Li, 32054 Taiwan
Fax: +886-3-426-2304
Email: asoffice@astro.ncu.edu.tw
url: www.astro.ncu.edu.tw

Attention: Prof W. P. Chen, Chair of Search Committee 
wchen@astro.ncu.edu.tw

The Institute solicits applications for 1-2 faculty positions to 
begin in the fall of 2001.  The appointment may be made at the full, 
associated or assistant professorship level. The Institute currently 
has 7 full-time faculty members, with research fields covering solar 
system physics, star formation, cosmic rays, luminous galaxies, and 
AGNs.  

The successful applicant should have a PhD in astronomy or 
physics, a track record of research accomplishment, and strong 
commitment to teaching at the graduate level.  A good command of 
Mandarin Chinese is preferred, but not essential.  Ongoing 
international collaborations include the BATC, TAOS and planetary 
missions such as Galileo, Cassini and Rosette.  We are planning on
building a mid-sized optical/infrared telescope in Taiwan, and are 
negotiating for access to large, international telescopes.   

The new faculty members should carry out their own independent 
research in theoretical or observational astrophysics, but are 
encouraged to take active parts in any of the forementioned 
collaborations.  The application should include a CV with publication 
list, a research plan, and three references sent directly to the 
addressee above by Feburary 1, 2001.

Attention: Prof W. P. Chen, Chair of Search Committee 
wchen@astro.ncu.edu.tw

Applications are invited for postdoctoral research positions at the 
Graduate Institute of Astronomy.  The successful applicants should 
carry out their own research, and would be expected to spend about 
half of their time helping out faculty projects such as on solar 
system physics, Kuiper-belt occultation experiment, star formation, 
MHD computation, cosmis rays physics, and variable stars.  
Applicants with experience in instrumentation or telescope operations 
would be particularly desirable in our telescope projects.      

The application should include a CV with pubcation list, a research 
plan, and three names to request letters of references from, and 
send to Prof W.P. Chen.  The application will be taken until 
the postions are filled.
