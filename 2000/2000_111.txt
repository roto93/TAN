LOCATION
--------

Amherst is nestled in the gorgeous Pioneer Valley of Western
Massachusetts, minutes from the Connecticut River and a short trip
from the Berkshire Mountains.  The area is rich in natural and human
history.  With the University and Amherst, Hampshire, Mt. Holyoke, and
Smith Colleges all nearby, it is also one of the cultural epicenters
of New England, enjoying abundant arts, music, theater, literature, and
academic activities.  Nearby Northampton was recently voted the "Best
U.S. Arts City Under 100,000"  and is a tourist destination well known
for its restaurants, galleries, and performance halls.

We are about an hour's drive from Hartford/Springfield's Bradley
International Airport, about two hours from Boston, and about 3.5
hours from New York City, all accessible by public transportation.  If
you fly in to Bradley, we recommend that you make reservations with
the Valley Transporter shuttle (1-800-872-8752) for transportation to
and from UMass.

If you do drive, discounted passes to park in the UMass Visitor Garage
will be available for $4/day.  

The weather in June is usually sunny and warm but not hot.
