             VC3:  VICTORIA COMPUTATIONAL COSMOLOGY CONFERENCE

    -----------------------------------------------------------------
    FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT ***  FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT *** FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT 
	(apologies if you receive this invitation more than once)
		***PLEASE ADVERTISE WIDELY***
    -----------------------------------------------------------------

VC3 is a 5-day workshop to be held between August 21st-26th, 2000, at
the University of Victoria in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada.

We are planning to bring together an exciting collection of leading,
established astrophysicists as well as up-and-coming  young researchers 
with exciting new results to discuss the interface between
state-of-the-art observations and theory, particularly from the
blossoming area of  computational cosmology. The meeting will seek to
address the following issues:

   * To discuss the latest progress in art and science of large-scale 
     numerical simulations of galaxy systems, 

   * To assess critically the insights into the formation & evolution
     of galaxy structures provided by large numerical experiments, 

   * To  contrast the state-of-the-art numerical results against
relevant, 
     recent observational evidence, 

   * To facilitate the planning of future progress.


DETAILS AND REGISTRATION INFORMATION FOR THE CONFERENCE CAN BE ACCESSED
AT

              http://pinot.phys.uvic.ca/~jfn/vc3/

Each day of the workshop will be devoted to one of the following five 
broad topics where the jostling between theory and observations can 
potentially lead to new insights: 

   1.THE MILKY WAY GALAXY AS THE PRODUCT OF A MERGER SEQUENCE 
   2.THE COSMOLOGICAL ASSEMBLY AND EVOLUTION OF GALAXIES 
   3.THE IMPACT OF THE ENVIRONMENT ON GALAXIES: CLUSTERS, GROUPS, 
     FILAMENTS, AND THE FIELD 
   4.THE IMPACT OF GALAXIES ON THEIR ENVIRONMENTS: THE ICM AND THE IGM 
   5.THE LY-ALPHA/GALAXY CONNECTION: FROM ABSORPTION LINES TO
FULL-FLEDGED 
     GALAXIES 

We encourage interested researchers to visit the conference website
(http://pinot.phys.uvic.ca/~jfn/vc3/) for more information and to
register as soon as possible. (Online registration and abstract
submission will be possible as of January 24, 2000. Please see the
conference website for details.) The maximum number of participants is
limited to 100. 

The deadline for submission of an abstract for oral or poster
presentation
is                                  APRIL 1, 2000

The deadline for registration is:   MAY 30, 2000

We encourage applications from graduate students and, depending on the
availability of funding, will attempt to make available a small subsidy
to offset partially the costs of attending the meeting.

We have already received a strong show of interest.  The following is a
*tentative* list of participants who will be making presentations during
the course of the workshop.
