The Solar & Astrophysics Lab at Lockheed Martin Missiles & Space (LMMS)
warmly invites you to Lake Tahoe, Nevada, for the 31st meeting of the
AAS/SPD on Monday, June 19, through Thursday, June 22, 2000. This is a
three-and-a-half day meeting with Wednesday afternoon set aside for
relaxation and excursions. SPD and AAS members are invited to submit
abstracts for oral and display sessions. We strongly encourage electronic
abstract submission and registration through our meeting homepage at

http://www.lmsal.com/spd

which includes further information about the meeting, the locale, and links
to the AAS for abstract submission. Additional information and the final
program will be posted to this Web site as they become available.

Scientific Organizing Committee: Steve Kahler (SPD vice-chair; AFRL) and
Karel Schrijver (LMMS). Local Organizing Committee: Keith Strong (chair),
Janet Biggs, and Zoe Frank, all of LMMS.

SCIENTIFIC PROGRAM

Contributions on all topics relating to solar physics are welcome. This
meeting will have 3.5 days of oral and poster sessions. As in past separate
SPD meetings, there will be no parallel oral sessions. The Monday morning
sessions will focus on the origin, development and dynamics of magnetic flux
in the solar photosphere. NASA solar programs will play a big role in the
Tuesday sessions, beginning with the new "Living with a Star" theme at NASA
and a review of solar physics in the NAS decadal survey of astronomy and
astrophysics. The sessions continue with the interdisciplinary connections
of solar physics with other fields. These will include summaries from the
SHINE meeting of the previous week at Caesar's Tahoe, dealing with (a)
coronal mass ejections and prominence eruptions and (b) interplanetary
connections of CMEs.

Wednesday morning sessions will involve confrontations of opposing models of
the solar chromosphere and alternative interpretations of structures above
quiet Sun regions in the transition region temperature (2 x 10(4) to 10(6)
K) range. Other oral sessions will be grouped around the traditional
subjects of helioseismology, coronal structure, flares and transients, and
the solar wind and heliosphere. The meeting will conclude with overviews of
the forthcoming HESSI, Solar B, and STEREO missions.

The SPD business meeting will be held on Monday evening. Items for the
agenda should be sent to Judy Karpen before the meeting (email:
judy.karpen@nrl.navy.mil ) with a copy to Steve Walton (email:
stephen.walton@csun.edu ).

The logistics of the meeting look very promising. Posters will have a 4x4 ft
display area (pins provided) and will be up during the entire meeting.
Coffee breaks, breakfasts and lunches will take place in the poster exhibit
area.

All sessions will be held at Caesar's Tahoe in Stateline, Nevada. The usual
audio-visual equipment will be available, including a video projector in the
meeting room. If you have special requirements for your presentation or
poster paper, please so indicate when you submit your abstract or register.

ABSTRACT SUBMISSION

Abstracts must be submitted for all types of papers: invited, display
(poster), oral (10 minutes), dissertation (15 minutes). Because of schedule
constraints the SOC expects that most abstracts requesting oral
presentations will be accepted as poster presentations. The SOC will be
looking for volunteers to chair the sessions. The AAS cost of the printing
of abstracts is included in the registration fee.

The following rules apply to abstract submissions. The presenting author
must be the lead author, i.e., listed first, on each paper. More than one
lead authorship per person for contributed papers is not allowed. Invited
speakers may submit one contributed poster or oral paper for which they are
lead author. Lead authors of contributed papers must be AAS or SPD members.

The abstract submission deadline is 9:00 pm ET, 30 March 2000. You are
encouraged to submit your abstract using the Web-based abstract form which
will be available on the meeting home page at http://www.lmsal.com/spd/ .
Alternatively, you may use the LaTeX template posted on the AAS ftp archive
at: ftp://ftp.aas.org/meetings/spd , which you submit by e-mail to
absspd-submit@aas.org . If you have any questions about electronic
submission while you are preparing your abstract, please contact the AAS
Executive Office for assistance, absspd-help@aas.org or 1-202-328-2010.

When you submit your abstract electronically, you should receive two

LOCALE

Lake Tahoe, the largest alpine lake in North America, remains one of the
finest year-round resorts in the world. With its crystal clear waters,
surrounding mountain forests and easy access from Reno, Lake Tahoe has been
a vacation destination for more than a century. The Lake Tahoe region in the
Sierra Mountains is famous for its ski resorts. In the summer Lake Tahoe
becomes a great locale for sailboating, windsurfing, or playing on countless
beaches. Lake Tahoe is so clear that you can see a plate at 75 feet below
the surface. Summer temperatures in the region range from 49 to 82 degrees
F.

Lake Tahoe is 98 miles northeast of Sacramento, California, 194 miles
northeast of San Francisco, and 58 miles southwest of Reno, Nevada. The
drive around the lake is 72 miles. The lake straddles the California/Nevada
border; 70% in California and 30% in Nevada. Lake Tahoe is further west than
Los Angeles. The town of Stateline, a major casino center with a number of
resort-hotels, is located on Lake Tahoe's south shore, on the
Nevada-California border. Local area information can be accessed at
http://www.tahoe.com .

TRANSPORTATION

The nearest regional airport is in Reno, Nevada, about one hour from South
Lake Tahoe. Contact Tahoe Casino Express for shuttle information (800 446

As hosts of the first of these SOLSPA conferences, it is our pleasure to
announce the meeting entitled The Solar Cycle and Terrestrial Climate which
will be held in Tenerife (Spain) from 25th to 29th September, 2000.

The main focus of the Euroconference will be on the theory and observations
of solar activity phenomena and their influence on the Earth's climate.

During the past two decades, satellite observations have revealed that the
total solar irradiance changes both the short timescale and the timescale of
the solar cycle. These changes in solar output with magnetic activity could
affect the terrestrial climate, especially if larger excursions occurred in
the past. One of these episodes took place in the 17th century (the Maunder
Minimum) with another shorter one at the beginning of the 1800s (the Dalton
Minimum).

The existence of indirect interactions (i.e. through cosmic rays or UV
radiation) could produce an increase in the influence of solar activity on
the terrestrial climate.

Simulating modern observations by an adequate combination of different kinds
of proxies, it might be possible to extrapolate the irradiance changes back
in time to periods for which no satellite measurements are available. In
other words, the present could be the key to the past. What we learn from
the past could be applied to the forecasting of future behaviour: the past
could be the key to the future.

These simulated observations can be compared with the corresponding records
of surface temperatures to test the validity of a connection between changes
in total solar irradiance and variations in the surface temperature, of the
Earth. This is especially timely in the context of the problem of global
warming; i.e. the increase in mean surface temperature by approx 0.5º C
during the present century. What is the percentage to be attributed to the
increase of solar activity during this period?

In order to evaluate the importance of the solar contribution to the present
terrestrial warming, is necessary to study in detail other sources of
variability such as the emission of greenhouse gases and aerosols and to
elaborate techniques for distinguishing between man-made and natural
variability.

This meeting will bring together different categories of researchers such as
solar and heliospheric physicists and climatologists, and will also involve
industrialists and environmentalists interested in the problem of global
warming. The participation of young researchers, PhD students and
post-doctoral, will be strongly encouraged and supported. Their active
participation in this highly interdisciplinary science will be sought and
encouraged.

The conference will take up four full days plus a fifth day (Wednesday)
devoted to a visit to the Observatorio del Teide. A preliminary programme is
presented below.

This first announcement is also a call for contributions. If you are
interested in attending the meeting and/or contributing a paper (oral or
poster), please fill out the pre-registration form to the LOC. The
registration form, the complete text of the first announcement, and the
pre-registration and travel and accomodation forms, can be obtained by
