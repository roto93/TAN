                      IAU Colloquium No. 183
             ****************************************** 
             Small-Telescope Astronomy on Global Scales
             ******************************************

           January 4 (Thursday; JD 2451914.0) - 8, 2001 
         Kenting National Park, Taiwan (E120 47', N21 57') 

Scientific Organizing Committee:
 . Charles Alcock (USA)                  
 . Yong-Ik Byun (Korea)
 . Wen-Ping Chen (Taipei, China; Co-Chair)
 . Alex Filippenko (USA)

 . Don Kurtz (South Africa)
 . Joanna Mikolajewska (Poland)
 . Bohdan Paczynski (USA; Co-Chair)
 . John Percy (Canada)
 . Hui-Song Tan (Nanjing, China)

Local Organizing Committee: 
   Hsiang-Kuang Chang, Wen-Ping Chen (Chair), Claudia Lemme, Chih-Kang Chou, 
   Rue-Ron Hsu, Wing Ip, Chorng-Yuan Hwang, Sun-Kun King, Wei-Hsin Sun 
 

We invite you to the southern tip of the Formosa island with its blue sky 
and tropical scenery.    

The colloquium covers both scientific and technological aspects of 
small-telescope astronomy.  Telescopes with apertures less than 1 m
have gained exciting new aspects in, for example, microlensing and optical 
transient studies, and the momentum is expected to continue, particular in
time-varying phenomena such as variable stars, stellar flares, close binary
systems, and asteroseismology.  The meeting aims to foster international
cooperations and regional scientific/engineering exchanges on variability 
or wide-field survey/monitoring projects of advantage to small telescopes. 
Scientists, engineers, hardware manufacturers and vendors are all welcome.  


Topics include:
------------------
- Telescope networks and arrays
- Sky- and time-coveraged surveys by small telescopes
- Observations of transient events: supernova search, optical bursts, flares
- Challenges in data archiving, processing, and communications
- Future of small-telescope astronomy
- New trends in hardware design and manufacturing

Presentations include invited and contributed talks, and posters. 
At this time we plan to publish the proceedings both on paper 
and on the web.  There will be a registration fee of USD$150 to offset the 
expenses of local transportation, drinks, the banquet, and the conference 
proceedings.  Accommodations abound in the region, from 5-star hotels to 
youth hostel and various guest houses.  Kenting features a wide variety of 
outdoor attractions, coral reefs, and a tropical national park.  The 
conference program will be such that plenty of leisure time will be available 
for sightseeing and activities.  An active spouse program can be 
expected.  Bring your swimming suits and suntan lotion.  

Deadlines:
- Abstract, registration, and financial support: September 16, 2000
- Accommodation reservation: October 1, 2000 

At this time we cannot estimate the exact funding, but limited financial 
support (e.g., living expenses, but likely not for airfare) for those who 
are really in need should be available.  We will solicit requests for 
financial support in the second announcement. 
 
Please visit our website at http://www.astro.ncu.edu.tw/iauc183 in which 
you can find a 'Registration/Reply form'.  Please return the form so
we know if we should keep your name on the future mailing list.  We will 
appreciate if you would call attention to anyone who might be interested in 
this conference either by circulating this message or our website address.   

Depending on your nationality, you might need a visa or entry permit to 
enter Taiwan.  Visa information for foreigners is provided at:
