FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT

RADIO IMAGING

A Spring School on processing radio astronomy data 
25 - 28 April 2000
Jodrell Bank Observatory, University of Manchester, England

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * 

Radio interferometers form part of the new generation of high resolution,
high sensitivity instruments. MERLIN and EVN observations which compliment
the HST, XMM and other deep fields are revealing hitherto unseen
populations of sources. The star formation history of the Universe, the
details of protostellar and protoplanetary discs, the processes in an AGN
or an X-Ray binary are just some of the outstanding questions in astronomy
which radio observations help to answer.

Present instruments have milli-arcsec or even micro-arcsec resolution and
spectral lines can be observed with a fractional resolution of one part in
10^6 or 10^7.  Demands for observing time are becoming ever more
competitive and new techniques are being developed for analysing the
increasing volumes of data.  Within the next decade, major upgrades and
new instruments will become available.  

This School is designed to help UK and other astronomers make the best use
of radio interferometers, now and in the future.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

Topics to be covered include:

Introduction to synthesis imaging 
 Note that in this and all sessions, applications involving new
 instruments eg ALMA will be included where relevant, as well as
 exisiting interferometers like MERLIN and VLBI networks - all present and
 potential users welcome! We will also cover combining data from different
 arrays.

The capabilities of radio telescopes

Basic data reduction techniques

Interpreting results and error analysis

Radio astronomy in the 2000's - deep fields, the future of the EVN and
MERLIN, radio and the rest of the spectrum.

The nature of radio sources and how to observe them - choosing an
instrument, writing the proposal, what to expect.

These sessions will cover the use of the appropriate data reduction
packages eg AIPS, AIPS++, DIFMAP.

There will be a mixture of lectures, small group tutorials and hands-on
experience and we will provide data and work-sheets for you to tackle at
your own pace, and a 'surgery'.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

There is no fee; accomodation (in student halls of residence) and meals
will be provided during the School.

Attendance at the School will be limited to about 30 people, so please
complete these details as soon as possible:

STUDENT?

Please indicate as appropriate:

I would like to register for the Spring School ____
(you will be sent more details in the next few weeks)

 Please state, in one or two sentences, your level of experience of radio
 data processing.  This is so that we can make sure the program caters to
 all requirements, whether you have never reduced radio data yourself or
 if you are an experienced user.

I would like more information about ____ 
before deciding to register
