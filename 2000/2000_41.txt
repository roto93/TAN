	    TITLE:   "Dust and PAH in Jovian Polar Regions"


ABSTRACT:  Aromatic compounds have been considered a likely candidate for 
enhanced dust formation in the polar region of Jupiter. A new photochemical 
model has been developed for calculating benzene and polycyclic aromatic 
hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the Jovian auroral thermosphere/ionosphere. The model 
is based on the generally accepted hydrocarbon photochemistry in the Jovian 
stratosphere and is constrained by observations from Voyager, Galileo and 
the Infrared Space Observatory. Precipitation of energetic electrons 
provides the major energy source for the production of benzene and other 
heavier PAHs, such as naphthalene, phenanthrene and pyrene. The mixing ratio 
of benzene in the polar model is on the order of 5.0E-9, a value that can be 
compared with the observed value of 2.0E-9 at mid-to high-latitudes. 
Sufficient quantities of the higher ring species are produced so that their 
saturated vapor pressures are exceeded. Condensation of these PAHs is 
expected to lead to dust formation in the polar region of Jupiter. Possible 
implications for the photochemical processes of forming PAHs from simple 
carbon molecules in the other astronomical site will also be discussed.
