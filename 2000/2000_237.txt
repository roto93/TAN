Attention: Professor K. Y. Lo

The ASIAA invites applications for at least 2 postdoctoral openings in
experimental and theoretical Cosmology. In collaboration with the Physics
department of the National Taiwan University and the Australia Telescope
National Facilities (ATNF,) the ASIAA is building the AMiBA (Array for
Microwave Background Anisotropy), a 19-element 85-105 GHz interferometer
array, designed specifically for a survey for high z clusters, the missing
baryons in super-clusters and filaments via the Sunyaev-Zeldovich Effect
and for measuring the polarization of the CMBR. The project is fully funded
and scheduled to be completed in 2003. The new Cosmology initiative also
involves theoretical efforts and collaboration with other international
research institutes, including the Canadian Institute of Theoretical
Astrophysics (CITA) and the Australia Telescope National Facility (ATNF).

The ASIAA has a large international postdoctoral program with more than 12
fellows, currently including Americans, Australians, French, Koreans,
Japanese and Vietnamese. English is the working language. There are ample
international travel support and a substantial computing capability.

The ASIAA is a 15% partner in the SMA (Sub-Millimeter-wave Array) which
will be operational with all 8 telescopes on Mauna Kea, Hawaii, by the end
of 2001. Another joint project, TAOS (Taiwan-America Occultation Survey),
is with the US Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and the National
Central University in Taiwan to conduct a census of Kuiper Belt objects. In
addition, OIR astronomy and instrumentation are also being developed.
Applicants with hardware and software expertise interested in taking part
in the various projects above are encouraged to apply.

Applicants should submit a CV, a statement of research interests, and three
letters of reference to Professor K. Y. Lo at the above address. Email
submission is encouraged. Applications can be submitted at any time, but
those received by 31 December 2000 will be given prompt consideration.

Attention: Professor K. Y. Lo

The ASIAA invites applications for 4 postdoctoral openings, available
immediately. The postdoctoral program consists of more than 12 fellows from
around the world, including Americans, Australians, French, Koreans,
Japanese and Vietnamese. English is the working language at the ASIAA.
Research interests include all areas in Astronomy and Astrophysics.

There is ample computing facility and research support, including travel
for international observing trips and meetings. The ASIAA is a 15% partner
in the 8-element Submillimeter-wave Array (SMA) on Mauna Kea, Hawaii, which
is being completed in the coming year. The ASIAA is also involved in TAOS
(Taiwan-America Occultation Survey), a joint project with the US Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory and the National Central University in Taiwan
to conduct a census of Kuiper Belt objects. In addition, there is a new
initiative in Cosmology and Particle Astrophysics which includes AMiBA, a
19-element dual-channel 85 - 105 GHz interferometer to measure the CMB
polarization and a survey of high z clusters using the Sunyaev-Zeldovich
effect. Furthermore, negotiations are being concluded to gain access to
large optical/IR (OIR) telescopes and to develop IR instrumentation.
Applicants with hardware and software expertise, interested in taking part
in any of the above projects, are encouraged to apply. Appointments are for
two years initially, but can be renewed up to a maximum of four years.

Applicants should submit a CV, a research plan, and three letters of
reference to Professor K. Y. Lo, at the above address. Email submission is
encouraged. More information on the ASIAA can be obtained at
http:://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw Applications can be submitted anytime, but
those received by 31 December 2000 will receive prompt attention.

Attention: Tung-Yi Lee, Professor and Chair

The Department of Earth Sciences of National Taiwan Normal University
invites applications for a faculty position in astronomy and astrophysics,
starting 1 August 2001; candidates in all areas will be considered. The
position is expected to be at the Assistant Professor level, but a higher
level appointment could be considered.

The department has eighteen full-time faculty members. The Astronomy group
is active in optical, radio and X-ray astronomy, and has a close research
tie with Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA);
faculty of the group teach undergraduate and graduate astronomy courses,
and supervise M.S. and Ph.D. students. Candidates should have a Ph.D. in
Astronomy, Astrophysics, Physics, or a closely related field, and
preferably have post-doctoral experience. Teaching experience in astronomy
at college level is a plus. Preference will be given to individuals whose
interests, abilities, and experience benefit our existing programs.

Applicants should submit by regular mail a curriculum vitae, a publications
list, a plan for research, a statement of teaching interests and
experience, a (photo)copy of doctorate diploma, and should have three
letters of reference sent directly to Professor Lee, Chair, Department of
Earth Sciences, at the above address. Complete applications should be
received by 1 March 2001.
