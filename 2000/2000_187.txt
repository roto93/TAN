Dear Colleague/Recipient,

Appended is a notice regarding a Postdoc Research Fellow position. We would 
be grateful if you could post this at your institution and forward it to 
anyone you think may be interested.

***************************************************************************

Postdoc Research Fellow
The University of Sydney and Australia Telescope National Facility, CSIRO
Salary:  Level A Academic $43,726 - $46,937
Closing:  5 October 2000

The University of Sydney and the CSIRO Australia Telescope National 
Facility, in collaboration with a number of international and national 
partners, are participating in the specification and design of a major 
next-generation radio telescope.  The telescope, which will be a $A1000M 
project, will have a collecting area of one square kilometre and will be 
100 times as sensitive as the best present-day instruments.  Operating in 
the frequency range 200 MHz - 20 GHz, this "square-kilometre array" or SKA, 
will be available for scientific use in the decade 2010-20 at a site to be 
determined.

We are seeking an enthusiastic and versatile postdoctoral researcher to 
participate in the exploratory phase of this exciting project. Applicants 
must have (or must shortly satisfy the requirements for) a PhD degree in 
physics, electrical engineering, or a related discipline.  Evidence of 
research potential and the potential for future development, and the 
ability to work co-operatively with others are also essential.  The 
position will involve a substantial radio-frequency technology component, 
and familiarity with RF is essential.  The appointee will work with the 
ATNF in the area of integrated antenna and receiver systems, and will 
participate in a range of contemporary design and development projects, 
including projects involving monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) 
development and fabrication.

Background information on the ATNF and the SKA can be found on the 
world-wide web at http://www.atnf.csiro.au.; information on the University 
is at http://www.usyd.edu.au.  As this is a joint appointment, the 
appointee will be encouraged to participate in the teaching program of the 
School of Physics, and to help expand an outreach and education program for 
the SKA.

The position is full-time fixed term for two years, subject to the 
completion of a satisfactory probation period for new appointees.  There is 
the possibility of further offers of employment for up to one year, subject 
to funding and need. Reimbursement of travel and relocation expenses may be 
payable in some circumstances.  For further information contact Dr 
Peter.Hall (Peter Hall@atnf.csiro.au) or Professor Lawrence Cram 
(lc@Physics.usyd.edu.au).

Application Information:

Intending applicants are encouraged to seek further information from the 
contact person before submitting a formal application.

Academic positions:

Applications (five copies) should quote the reference no, address the 
selection criteria, and include a CV, a list of publications, the names, 
addresses, e-mail, fax and phone number of confidential referees (three).

Forwarding Applications:
