Dear Colleague,

I would like to bring IAU 205 "Galaxies and their constituents at the highest angular resolutions" to your attention. It will be held from 15 to 18 August, 2000 in Manchester as part of the General Assembly. 

The deadline for submission of abstracts for contributed papers is 15 February. The same deadline applies for requests for financial support. Abstracts can be submitted via email to me at schilizzi@jive.nl; requests for financial support must be submitted on the forms provided by the IAU in Bulletins 85 and 86.

I enclose the preliminary programme and list of invited speakers. Further information can be found on the symposium website http://www.jive.nl/iausymp.htm and on the IAU website http://www.iau.org 


Please pass this information on to others who may be interested to take part.


Yours sincerely,

Richard Schilizzi

Chairman, SOC IAU205
