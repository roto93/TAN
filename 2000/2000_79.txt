4.  SPACE INTERFEROMETRY MISSION SCIENCE TEAM AO
    Letters of Intent Due: 27 March 2000
    Proposals Due: 26 May 2000.

NASA has released an Announcement of Opportunity (AO 00-OSS-01)
for participation on the SIM Science Team.  The formal 
announcement is on the Office of Space Science web site, at:

http://spacescience.nasa.gov/research/open.htm

This AO solicits Key Science Projects for SIM, and also for 
qualified individual scientists to serve on the Science Team.  
Information for proposers is available via a set of information 
pages on the JPL SIM web site: http://sim.jpl.nasa.gov/ao_support

All questions regarding this Announcement of Opportunity should 
be directed to the SIM Program Scientist, Philippe Crane, at
mailto:pcrane@mail.hq.nasa.gov.  If necessary, the web site will be 
updated with new information, including 'Frequently Asked Questions'.  
Proposers should check for updates occasionally; the revision date 
of the above web page will indicate any changes.  More general 
information on SIM is available at the main web site:
http://sim.jpl.nasa.gov/

5.  EARLY SCIENTIFIC USE OF THE GEMINI NORTH TELESCOPE
    QuickStart Proposal Deadlines Vary:  31 March - 14 April 2000
    Demonstration Science Letters of Interest Due:  31 March 2000

The Gemini Observatory announces a one-time-only early 
opportunity to use the 8-m Gemini telescope on Mauna Kea.  
The opportunity consists of two separate programs; a QuickStart 
Service (QSS) program and a Demonstration Science(DS) program.  
Two visiting instruments will be available for use: Hokupa'a/QUIRC 
the University of Hawaii 1-2.5um Adaptive Optics module and 
near-IR imager, and OSCIR a University of Florida 8 - 25um
imager/spectrometer.

The QSS program is a service observing opportunity where Gemini 
staff will execute observations proposed by members of the Gemini 
communities.   The Observatory will endeavor to make available at 
least one week of telescope time each month for the QSS program 
starting in August 2000 and continuing until the end of Jan 2001.  
The DS program will pursue two scientific themes; one using 
Hokupa'a/QUIRC and one using OSCIR.  Each theme will be allocated 
1 to 1.5 weeks of telescope time prior to the start of the QSS 
observations. The intent of the DS program is to produce data sets 
for the community that illustrate the capabilities of the Gemini 
telescope and will be of immediate scientific interest.  Gemini 
will be forming two international DS teams to work closely with 
Observatory staff to define the two themes, their scientific goals 
and observations, execute the observations, reduce the data and 
prepare the data products. 

For more information on this opportunity, the instrumentation 
and the proposal process, please see http://www.gemini.edu/ or 
the U.S. mirror site at http://www.us-gemini.noao.edu.

Proposals for use of QSS time should be submitted through 
the National Project Offices of the Gemini Partner countries. 
Submission deadlines range from 31 March 2000 to 14 April 2000 
depending on country.

Investigators proposing for Gemini QuickStart observations 
through the U.S. share should apply through the normal NOAO 
proposal process at http://www.noao.edu/noaoprop/.  Proposals 
are due 31 March 2000.

Letters of interest for participation in the DS Program should 
be emailed to mailto:demoscience@gemini.edu and are due by 
31 March 2000.

The amount and distribution of telescope time available for 
these programs is also subject to reassessment as part of the 
Gemini Operational Readiness Review, scheduled for 1,2 May 2000.

NOAO/U.S. Gemini Program

(Reminder: the deadline for the second round of request for 
Keck/NIRSPEC observations is 21 March (see 
http://www.us-gemini.noao.edu for further details).)

6.  SOUTH POLE OBSERVING OPPORTUNITY
    Proposals Due: before 20 April 2000 

The Antarctic Submillimeter Telescope and Remote Observatory 
(AST/RO) invites proposals for use of the 1.7m telescope 
during the current Austral winter season (April-October 2000).  
Proposals may be submitted by any qualified astronomer and 
will be evaluated based on scientific merit.  Scheduled 
observations will be carried out by the AST/RO winter-over 
scientist in residence at South Pole, Dr. Rodney Marks, who 
will be considered a scientific collaborator on the observations.  

Proposals submitted last year were reviewed, but observations 
were not possible due to instrumental problems.  These problems 
have now been solved and we anticipate an excellent observing 
season this year.  Previously submitted proposals will be 
considered again for scheduling this year, with modifications 
possible.

SIS receivers at 810, 460-492, and 230 GHz will be available, 
along with two acousto-optical spectrometers (AOS) with 
1.07 MHz resolution and 1.1 GHz bandwith, and one AOS with 
44 kHz resolution and 64 MHz bandwidth. Instrumental parameters 
are available on our web site 
(http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/~adair/AST_RO), or by contacting 
Tony Stark or Adair Lane.

Proposals sent to the following address before 20 April 2000 
will be evaluated by the AST/RO Telescope Allocation Committee 
for scheduling later in the season:  Dr. Adair P. Lane,
Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, 60 Garden Street, 
MS-78, Cambridge, MA 02138 
(or email proposal to: mailto:adair@cfa.harvard.edu).

7.  2MASS SECOND INCREMENTAL DATA RELEASE

The Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) announces the public 
availability of its Second Incremental Data Release, which 
includes JHKs data from the northern and southern 2MASS facilities, 
covering 47% of the sky.  Data products include positions and 
photometry for over 162 million point sources; positions, photometry 
and basic shape information for over 585,000 extended sources; and,
approximately 1.9 million compressed 512x1024 pixel (1"/pixel) images 
in the three Survey bandpasses.  Details are available on the 2MASS 
web site at IPAC: http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/2mass/. 

2MASS is a joint project of the University of Massachusetts and 
the Infrared Processing and Analysis Center/California Institute of 
Technology, funded by NASA and the NSF.

8.  FRIENDS OF DARK SKIES
    Bob Gent, Public Relations Officer, IDA

The April 2000 issue of Audubon magazine is now on the news stands.  
On the front page, the title "Reduce Light Pollution (p. 92)" appears.  
The article by Joe Bower is six pages long and is a major step forward 
in describing light pollution's problems and solutions.  It describes 
the adverse impacts of bright lights on birds, and there are many 
excellent quotes, side bars, and references.
