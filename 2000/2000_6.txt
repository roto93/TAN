Dear Colleagues:

    Enclosed please find two announcements of the "OCPA CONFERENCE IN HK 2000",
which is the 3rd World Chinese Physics Conference, sponsored by OCPA
(Oversea Chinese Physics Association). 

    The first Conference was held in Shan-Tou, 1994 and the second one in Taipei,
1997, in honor of Dr. Wu Ta-you. Astrophysics has always been an active component
of the conference. In fact, we want to make an impact on our fellow physicists
how impressive we have contributed to the field.

    We are working on the invitations now and will put forth an impressive
program. Please mark your calendar and consider to join us in Hong Kong.

    With best regards,                 Chi Yuan
				       on behalf of Organizing Committee

For OCPA members traveling from N. America, Europe and Taiwan, because
of their burden of overseas travel, OCPA will use part of its
resources to provide some local support for these members.  The exact
amount depends on the number of members requesting partial support and
OCPA resources.  OCPA mem-bers may email ocpa2000@cmuhep2.phys.cmu.edu
for update as the time nears.

G. Conference Banquet will be held on Thursday evening at the Royal
Plaza Hotel in the Grand Century Place, a large shopping mall just
next to the Mongkok Train Station.  It will be a buffet dinner.  In
order to encourage accompanying spouses to join the banquet, a
discount price of HK$200 per person will be charged to them.

ACCOMMODATIONS
**************

A.	On-campus:

(a) Air-conditioned student dormitory - about HK$130 per night per
person, double occupancy, with two single beds in each room, and on
each floor (with around 15 rooms) one big common bath room with
several separate showers. (Note that a number of places will be
reserved for holders of conference grants.)

(b)	CU guest house -

(i) Chiang Building: 64 two-bed rooms, each sharing a bath with
another at the rate of about HK$390 per room per night.

(ii) Kwan Tung Building: 30 two-bed rooms with private bath at an
estimate rate of $420 per room per night.

The On-Campus Accommodation Reservation Form is attached at the end of
this announcement.  Because of limited number of places, reservations
will be handled on a first-come-first-served basis. Please reserve
early.  For further details, please contact Miss P. Y. Ho (address:
Department of Physics, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin,
N.T., Hong Kong; e-mail: pyho@phy.cuhk.edu.hk).

B.	Off-campus:

Royal Park Hotel at Shatin is strongly recommended.  It is virtually
next-door to the New Town Plaza, one of the biggest shopping malls in
Hong Kong.  It takes only a couple minutes to walk to the Shatin
railway station, from there you can easily get to the Chinese
University and, in addition, get to almost anywhere in Hong Kong
through a southbound train and a connection to the MTR subways at
Kowloon Tong.  Moreover, there is a bus stop to take you to-and-fro
the new international airport in a luxurious bus at a rate of only
HK$20!  It is a 4-star hotel and we can enjoy the special rate of
HK$600 per night per room for two.  (The quoted rate excludes the 10%
service charge and the 3% tax.)  More information about the hotel can
be found in http://www.royalpark.com.hk and the booking form below.
Booking must be made directly with the hotel.  The Accommodation
Reservation Form is attached at the end of this announcement.
