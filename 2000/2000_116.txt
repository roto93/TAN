Dear Recipient,

Appended is a notice regarding a Research Support Engineer position at the 
Australia Telescope National Facility, CSIRO. We would be grateful if you 
could post this at your institution and forward it to anyone you think may 
be interested.

Yours sincerely,
Anne Barends


Research Support Engineer
$34K - $51K + Superannuation


The Australia Telescope National Facility (ATNF), in collaboration with 
international and national partners, is participating in the specification 
and design of a very large next-generation radio telescope.  The telescope, 
known as the square-kilometre array (SKA),  will operate in the range 200 
MHz - 20 GHz and will be 100 times as sensitive as the best present-day 
instruments

The ATNF is seeking an engineer to participate in the exploratory phase of 
this exciting project. Duties involve assisting in the preparation of an 
engineering definition document for the SKA, support of radio astronomy 
programs designed to test new techniques, and contributing to RF or digital 
system developments such as high dynamic range integrated receivers or 
DSP-based interference cancellers.

The appointee will have graduated, or will shortly graduate, in a relevant 
engineering field, and will have excellent hands-on skills as well as a 
sound understanding of physical principles. Competence in contemporary 
engineering practice is required, especially in areas such as the use of 
CAD tools, development of PC-based instrumentation systems, and 
implementation of programmable hardware designs.  Additional requirements 
are very good written and oral communication skills (including at least 
basic Web publishing ability), superior problem solving ability, and a 
willingness to travel to remote sites for short periods.

The initial appointment will be for a period of two years. Information on 
the ATNF and the SKA can be found on the Web at 
http://www.atnf.csiro.au.  Further information on the position can be 
obtained from Dr Peter Hall, SKA Program Leader, on (02) 9372 4195, e-mail 
Peter.Hall@atnf.csiro.au.

Applications, quoting Reference No. AT20/3 and including details of your 
skills, qualifications, work achievements and the names of two professional 
referees, should be sent to the Human Resources Manager, CSIRO (ATNF), PO 
Box 76, Epping NSW 1710 by 19 May 2000.
