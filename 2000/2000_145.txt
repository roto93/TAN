Dear CosPA colleagues,

As of yesterday, the cospa journal club for this semester was over.
I would like to evaluate that the meeting went quite well this 
semester, in terms of the quality of the talks given and the number 
of the audiences, much improved compared with the last semester.   

I thank all of you for your sincere interest and support for the cospa 
meeting.  My heartful thanks goes to the speakers for their pains to 
prepare their talks.
    
Especially I cannot thank too much Emily and Ms. Hwang who did their 
best jobs to order the free lunch boxes for us.  

Of course, we will make continuous efforts to keep and even improve 
our cospa journal club meeting in the future.

Have a nice summer session, and I will look forward to seeing you 
all next semester. 

Best regards,

Jounghun Lee
