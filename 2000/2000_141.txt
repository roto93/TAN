Re:   Announcement of the Open Use


Dear Expected Users of the Subaru Telescope,

After 9 years of construction, the Subaru Telescope will be ready for
open use in December 2000.  We understand that not only the Japanese
Astronomical community, but also the Astronomical Societies throughout
the world are looking forward to this prestigious moment.  At this time
we would like to make a Call for Proposals for the open use.  We
anticipate that Subaru Telescope will become one of the great explorers
of the Universe.

We would also like to take this time to express our gratitude to the
many people and organizations who have supported this project
throughout the years.

Sincerely,

Hiroyasu Ando
Director, Subaru Telescope, NAOJ




============================================================

              Call for Proposals for Observations 
                     with the Subaru Telescope

                        *** Version 1.1 ***

        Semester S00: 2000 December -- 2001 March

                          Subaru Telescope
      National Astronomical Observatory of Japan

Please refer to http://www.naoj.org/Observing/index.html 
for the latest information.




1. INTRODUCTION AND PROPOSAL ACCEPTANCE POLICY

     The Subaru Telescope invites observing proposals for Semester S00, 
which will run from December 2000 until March 2001.  The Infrared 
Camera and Spectrograph (IRCS) and Subaru Prime Focus Camera 
(Suprime-Cam) will be available for use by visiting observers.  Although  
the Subaru Telescope is entirely funded by the Japanese government, we 
also invite proposals from the international community.  The actual 
number of nights to be allocated to international proposals[see note 1] 
will be determined by the time allocation committee.  Non-Japanese 
researchers are encouraged to submit their proposals in collaboration 
with Japanese researchers.

[1] International proposals are defined as those submitted by 
  non-Japanese principal investigators (PIs) belonging to non-Japanese 
  institutions.

     Although commissioning of the telescope and instruments will 
continue through Semester S00, approximately 36 nights will be allocated  
for the open use during this period. The Subaru Telescope asks applicants 
to understand that, under such circumstances, observations will be 
carried out in "shared-risk" mode. Loss of telescope time due to 
telescope or instrument failures will be compensated only in 
exceptional circumstances.

     Other important information for your preparation of a proposal is as 
follows.
i) Only IRCS or Suprime-Cam (not both) should be specified for each 
    observing proposal.
ii) Observing time will be awarded in units of 1 night, up to a maximum of 
    3 nights.
iii) Target-of-Opportunity observations of unpredictable transient 
    phenomena (e.g. new supernovae, nova outbursts, gamma-ray bursts) 
    will not be accepted.
iv) Applicants should refer to the guidelines regarding Guaranteed Time 
    Observations (GTO) with Suprime-Cam in APPENDIX B before submitting 
    a proposal. The Time Allocation Committee has the final say in issues 
    of conflict between GTO and open use observations.

2. OVERVIEW OF OPEN USE SCHEDULE

     Proposal Deadline: 2000 July 3 (Japan Standard Time)
     Refereeing: 2000 July
     Time Allocation Committee: 2000 August
     Telescope Time Scheduling: 2000 September
     Semester S00: 2000 December ミ 2001 March
     Total number of nights for open use: (approx.) 36 nights

3. PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION OF PROPOSALS

     Prospective applicants must fill in the "Application Form for 
Telescope Time" (2 pages) and prepare a scientific justification of 
not more than 2 pages of A4 or letter size paper. These documents 
should be prepared in English, although a Japanese translation (i.e., 
no new information) of the scientific justification may also be included. 
Proposals whose English text is in a font smaller than 10 point will 
be automatically rejected.

     Send: 16 copies of
         1. Application Form for Telescope Time (2 pages)
         2. Scientific Justification (with Japanese translation, if any)

     To: Dr. Motohide Tamura
           Subaru Project Office
           National Astronomical Observatory
           Osawa 2-21-1, Mitaka, Tokyo 181-8588, Japan

     By: Proposal Submission deadline:  2000 July 3 (JST)

     Please write "Subaru Telescope Proposal" in red ink on the envelope.

     Electronic submission of the "Application Form for Telescope Time" 
(2 pages) is available, although not mandatory, at http://www.naoj.org.   
Note, however, that the electronically submitted application will not be  
accepted unless the corresponding hardcopies arrive at the Subaru Project 
Office by the deadline.

4. HOW TO COMPLETE THE APPLICATION FORM

 4-1. Title of Proposal
   Provide a short title for your proposal.

 4-2. Principal Investigator
   Provide contact details for the PI. The observatory will contact the PI 
   with any questions regarding the proposal or observations.

 4-3. Scientific Category
   Please check one and only one category from the 5 listed (see 
   APPENDIX A).  Each proposal will be reviewed by a panel of 5 
   referees who are experts in the appropriate category.

 4-4. Abstract
   The abstract may be up to 11 lines of text, which corresponds to 
   approximately 200 words.

 4-5. Observing Run
   List an instrument (either IRCS or Suprime-Cam[see note 2]), requested 
   nights (1, 2, or 3), preferred month(s) and lunar phase (Bright, Gray or 
   Dark).  Dark time is defined as being within 3 nights of the New Moon, 
   and Bright time is within 3 nights of the Full Moon; Gray time is the  
   remaining part of the lunar cycle.  Applicants who request Dark time 
   for IRCS observations  should justify this in their scientific 
   justification.

   Put the total number of requested nights in the box.  

  [2] We are unable to accommodate in S00 such a proposal that uses both  
    IRCS and Suprime-Cam, since switching between the two takes not 
    less than two full days, which results in significant loss of telescope 
    time. 

 4-6. Co-Investigators
   List the names of co-investigators. There will be limited travel 
   support for researchers and graduate students who belong to 
   Japanese institutions. Those who want to receive travel support 
   must be nominated here.

 4-7. Proposal Status
   Do not enter anything here.

 4-8. List of Targets
   List all the proposed targets. J2000 is recommended for the equinox. 
   Use an additional sheet if necessary.  

 4-9. Scheduling Requirements
   Any special scheduling requirements should be explained here.  Time 
   critical observations will only be accepted if a specific date is listed.

 4-10. Instrument Requirements
   Specific or unusual instrument requirements should be explained here.  
   No private instruments will be accepted during Semester S00.
   
 4-11. List of Applicant's Related Publications
   List (with full citation) recent publications in the last 5 years 
   related to the proposal.

 4-12. Backup Proposal in Poor Conditions
   Provide a short description of observations which will be carried out if 
   conditions are not good enough for the main proposal (e.g., poor 
   transparency).

 4-13. Thesis Work
   If the observations will form part of a graduate student's thesis project, 
   please provide the student's name and thesis title.

6. STATUS OF  TELESCOPE

   The latest telescope performance figures can be found at 
   http://www.naoj.org/Observing/Telescope/performance.html

 6-1. Target acquisition
   The r.m.s. absolute pointing accuracy of Subaru is better than 1''.  
   More accurate target acquisition can be obtained with the acquisition  
   and guide (AG) probe, which can position a target to 0.07''  accuracy  
   within its 30'' field of view.

 6-2. Tracking/guiding performance
   The tracking (i.e., no guide star) accuracy of Subaru Telescope is 
   0.15'' -- 0.3" for integrations of 3 minute. This degrades to 0.2'' over 
   10 minutes, and 0.6'' over 30 minutes under the best conditions.

   The guiding accuracy is typically about 0.12'' and stars down to 
   V=18 have successfully been used at the Cassegrain focus.  The 
   performance at other foci has not yet been determined.  Applicants 
   should be aware that there is approximately 10% drop of signal at 
   the Suprime-Cam field edge due to vignetting by the AG probe for 
   guide stars at a nominal distance of 13' from the field center. 
   Choosing guide stars closer to the field center will cause more 
   severe vignetting. 

7. STATUS OF INSTRUMENTS

     Only IRCS and Suprime-Cam will be available for the open use.  
All potential applicants should refer to 
http://www.naoj.org/Observing/Instruments/index.html 
for the latest instrument performance figures.

 7-1. IRCS 
   IRCS will be available for imaging and grism spectroscopy with the 
   60 mas plate scale, and for echelle spectroscopy. Broad-band 
   JHK'KL'M' filters will be available, as well as narrow-band 
   [Fe II] and Br gamma. 

 7-2. Suprime-Cam 
   Suprime-Cam will be available with 8 CCDs providing a 24' x 24' 
   field of view.  Johnson BVRI and SDSS g'r'i'z' filters will be available.

Important Remarks
   Some proposals may appear to be equally suited to more than one category. 
   In such cases, the applicant should select a category based on the 
   scientific aims of the proposal rather than the target objects.  In order 
   to ensure fair refereeing, and that similar proposals are refereed by the 
   same panel, the applicant's choice of category may be overruled.


APPENDIX B

CONFLICTS WITH SUPRIME-CAM GUARANTEED TIME OBSERVATIONS

    A number of nights have been reserved for Guaranteed Time Observations 
by Suprime-Cam. This Appendix lists those observations which might conflict 
with targets proposed for Open Use in Semester S00.

    Most observations planned for Suprime-Cam's Guaranteed Time 
involve imaging of high Galactic latitude fields. The data will be 
shared by different programs, most of which do not insist on specific 
fields. The actual fields observed will therefore be determined by 
factors such as accessibility under good seeing conditions during the 
observing runs, and only two fields are embargoed (all coordinates in 
this Appendix are J2000.0):

  Field-1 (13:24:21, +27:29:23)
  Field-2 ( 2:18:00, -05:00:00)

The list of key programs is:

1. Large scale mass distribution and shear variance from weak lensing
2. Photometric redshifts and morphology of distant field galaxies
3. Evolution of luminosity function, SED, star formation rate, and type 
    mix of field galaxies
4. Evolution of the large scale structure of galaxies
5. Search for the origin of highest energy cosmic rays
6. Search for high-z supernovae

While proposals with similar scientific objectives to these key programs  
will be considered by the TAC, applicants should be aware that such 
proposals may be required to meet a slightly higher standard, or find 
new and original applications for the data, than proposals in unrelated 
fields. The TAC's decision in such matters is final.

In addition, the following specific fields will be observed during the 
Guaranteed Time. Applicants may not propose to observe these fields for 
the same scientific objectives as the Guaranteed Time Observations. 
Applicants who wish to observe these fields for different objectives may  
propose to do so, on the understanding that their data become immediately 
available to the Suprime-Cam team. However, such applicants must first 
contact the PI of Suprime-Cam, Prof. Sadanori Okamura 
(email: okamura@astron.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp), to confirm the difference in 
their scientific objectives, before submitting their proposal.
