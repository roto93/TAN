Towards a Virtual Observatory
Call for Participation

Dear Colleague:

The recent National Academy of Science report, Astronomy and Astrophysics
in the New Millennium, ranked a National Virtual Observatory (NVO) as the
most important small initiative in astronomy for the 2001-2010 timeframe.
The NVO would provide a seamless digital sky in all wavelengths based on
the massive data sets being created now and the even more massive data sets
yet to come with future surveys and observatories, plus develop new tools
to explore the data base.  The application of these new tools to this vast
amount of integrated information would enable a new mode of research for
astronomers and astrophysicists, as well as provide a powerful opportunity
for education and public outreach.

In addition to the National Academy report, the community-driven push for
an NVO is further evidenced in a White Paper submitted to NASA and NSF from
an ad hoc steering committee toward that purpose.  And in June some 160
astrophysicists, computer scientists, and technologists participated at a
conference at Caltech to discuss the scientific motivation and needs, and
the technical challenges related to conception of an NVO and its global
equivalent.  (http://astro.caltech.edu/nvoconf/).
  
The NASA Office of Space Science (OSS) intends to establish a Virtual
Observatory (VO) initiative to respond to these recommendations. This
announcement seeks representatives from the community to serve on the VO
Science Definition Team, which will be chartered to provide science
guidance and oversight during the definition phase.  OSS is also seeking
Concept Papers and other forms of general response from the community for
OSS to consider in defining and establishing the VO initiative.

A project-like approach will be used to implement this initiative, led by a
team of a VO Project Scientist and VO Project Manager.  It will be
conducted in cooperation and coordination with other federal agencies as
well as with our international colleagues.   There is funding identified in
the FY01 budget for defining and formulating the initiative, but future
funding beyond formulation is not assured.    

The intent will be to build on current data archiving and analysis
capabilities.  But while these and other subsets of VO-like capabilities
provide a useful experience base to work from, the full realization of the
seamless integration of our data assets and the tools to explore the vast
collective parameter space remains an extremely challenging task.  The
challenges provide a substantial opportunity for effective partnerships
between the astrophysics and computer science and technology communities.   

The Science Definition Team will act as the community conscience for the VO
initiative and will assist OSS in developing the science requirements and
performance metrics, assessing design concepts, implementation plans and
schedules, and assuring performance.  The Science Definition Team will also
represent the VO initiative and serve as a liaison to the larger space
science and computer science communities.
 
Individuals from the community interested in serving on the Science
Definition Team should respond with a short (approximately 3 page) letter
of interest and curriculum vitae outlining experience and expertise the
applicant would bring to the working group.  It should also identify
aspects of particular interest to the applicant. 

OSS will select a 10-12 person Science Definition Team from the letters of
interest.  The intent will be to form a balanced and broadly representative
group across astrophysics and computer science.  

VO Concept Papers should provide a brief (8-10 page) response with general
reaction to, and ideas, thoughts, and suggestions for the OSS VO
initiative. This could include science goals and driving needs for the
initiative, the high-level functional requirements, conceptual design and
alternative considerations, and first order resource estimates for
achieving those goals.  Key issues and challenges associated with the
initiative as well as approaches for resolving them should be outlined.
Management structure and approaches for the formulation and implementation
phases should be considered, as well as identification of roles,
responsibilities, and qualifications for key personnel (project scientist
and project manager, as a minimum). 

These responses will serve as very important input to OSS in collaboration
with the Science Definition Team to proceed with the definition and
formulation of the VO initiative.

Concept Papers and letters of interest for the Science Definition Team
should be mailed to Joe Bredekamp, Senior Science Program Executive for the
Virtual Observatory.  His mail address is Code SR, NASA Headquarters,
Washington, DC 20546.  Copies can also be e-mailed as Word or ASCII files
to joe.bredekamp@hq.nasa.gov .   For consideration they should be received
by November 30, 2000.

Sincerely,


Dr. Anne L. Kinney                                               Dr. Alan
N. Bunner                          
Science Program Director                                    Science Program
Director
Astronomical Search for Origins                          Structure and
Evolution of
   and Planetary Systems                                        the Universe
