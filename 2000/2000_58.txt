Dear everybody,

    Hi, cospa colleagues, How is your winter session going ?
Unfortunately we do not have the cospa journal meeting next two weeks.
The main reason for cancelling our meeting is that ASIAA will have a 
panel meeting on 3/1-3/2, and also the poster presentation of the
postdoctors to the panel members on 2/28-2/29.  
Besides Prof. Typhoon Lee was supposed to give the breaking talk, 
but will be out of town next week.

So, our new semester Journal Club will start on March 9th. The  
tentative speaker on 3/9 is Dr. Yi Nan Chin who will give a talk 
on the nucleosythesis of the early universe.

I will announce the meeting schedule and the speaker/title later.

So, relax two more weeks, and see you on March 9th.

cheers,

Jounghun Lee
