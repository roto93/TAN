    The Initiative in Search for Academic Excellence promoted by the 
Ministry of Education (Taiwan) has selected the CosPA project as one of 
the projects of the highest priority to be fully funded to the level of 
slightly over 15 Million U.S. dollars over the next four years. There are 
five key components of the CosPA project: 

    (1) Array for Microwave Background Radiation (AMIBA Telescope): From 
        Construction and Operation to Data Acquisition and Analysis. 
    (2) Experimental Particle Physics Studies on Issues related to "Early 
        Universe, Dark Matter, and Inflation".
    (3) Theoretical Studies of Cosmology and Particle Astrophysics.
    (4) Frontier Observation in Optical and Infrared Astronomy.
    (5) National Infrastructure.

In addition to construction of AMIBA Telescope as one of our primary 
missions, we are taking such unique opportunity to gradually establish a 
Center for Academic Excellence on "Cosmology and Particle Astrophysics" 
with several permanent and visiting positions immediately available for 
those who wish to join us in taking up this graned challenge. The 
positions include:

(1) Visiting Chair Professor lasting from three months or longer;

(2) Visiting Professor, and Visiting Associate Professor;

(3) Visiting Assistant Professor, or Visiting Experts;

(4) Postdoctoral Research Fellows in connection with Subprojects (3), (1), 
    and (2); and

(5) Permanent faculty members in connection with this Department or 
    with Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Academia Sinica.

For those who are interested in any of these positions, please contact, by 
FAX at (886) 2 2363 9984 or by e-mail at wyhwang@phys.ntu.edu.tw, the 
project P.I.: W-Y. Pauchy Hwang, Chairman and Professor, Department of 
Physics, National Taiwan University, Taipei 106, Taiwan. Or, please 
contact the propject Co-P.I.: Dr. K.Y. Lo, Director, Institute of  
Astronomy and Astrophysics, Academia Sinica, Nankang, Taipei 115, Taiwan,
through (886) 2 2788 1106 (FAX) or kyl@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw (e-mail). 
Arranging three letters of recommentation in support of your application 
towards positions at relatively junior level or permanent in nature, sent 
directly to us, shall be greatly appreciated.
         
There is no definite application deadline for these positions. The 
applications will be reviewed periodically (during the next four years 
and even beyond) and offers shall be made according to individual
