    Martin A. Slade, marty@shannon.jpl.nasa.gov
 
The Task Manager of the Goldstone Solar System Radar (GSSR) 
would like to remind the astronomical community that observing 
proposals for the period 01 January 2001 through 01 June 2001, 
are due no later than 15 June 2000.  Since this observing
proposal procedure was recently put in place, a reminder seemed
appropriate.  The observing proposal forms are available from:

           http://www331.jpl.nasa.gov/radar/

in Word 6 and ASCII text formats.  A "forms"-based version will 
be in place before 15 June.
