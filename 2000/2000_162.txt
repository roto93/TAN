				Operations Scientist
			   $35k - $52k + superannuation

The CSIRO Parkes Observatory is part of the Australia Telescope National
Facility (ATNF), a radio astronomical facility operated by CSIRO with the aim of
advancing knowledge about the Universe. Information about the ATNF can be found
at www.atnf.csiro.au

The Parkes Observatory is seeking an enthusiastic scientific professional with
interests in modern computing systems and astronomy to join a small team having
responsibility for the operations and systems development at the radio
telescope.

The appointee will develop new observing techniques and software to meet the
Observatory's evolving needs, and will become deeply involved in the day-to-day
support of visiting astronomers at the Observatory.  Applicants should have good
communication skills, should possess a degree in a physical science, engineering
or some related field, and have basic skills in software development and
documentation. 

In addition to the support and developmental work, there will be some
opportunity to become involved in research projects currently underway on the
telescope. In particular these projects include: an all-sky survey in the 21-cm
hydrogen line using the 13-beam receiver and a Galactic Pulsar Survey. Some
fraction of time will also be available for individual astronomical research.

The telescope operates continuously, 24 hours a day, and the appointee will be
expected to work flexible hours and reside in the Parkes area.  The position is
offered as a 3 year appointment.

Enquiries and requests for duty statements and selection criteria should be
