Delegation from NCHC Participated in SC99 Exhibits

   A nine-member delegation, led by Deputy Director 
Whey-Fone Tsai of the NCHC, was at the SC99 Exhibition in 
Portland, Oregon during the week of November 13-19, 1999.  
Close to 70 exhibitors, many from outside the United States, 
participated in the "research exhibits."  It was a record 
turnout.  This is the second time that the National Center 
for High-Performance Computing participated in the SC 
Exhibits.  Last year, at SC98, the NCHC was initiated into 
the iGrid.  It is especially fitting for the NCHC to 
participate in this year's event for the emphasis is on "High 
Performance Networking and Computing."  A recent mandate 
charged the NCHC to take on the implementation of the nation's 
high-performance networking.

   Making use of the ImmersaDesk set up at the exhibit floor, 
the team presented several projects.  Dr. Fang-pang showed 
the modeling of patterns generated to simulate wood grains 
during the manufacturing of "plastic wood."  Made by 
extrusion, the fake wood is a substitute of the natural product 
for paneling and molding in the construction industry.  The 
modeling is based on the Numerical Wind Tunnel, developed at 
the NCHC. (http://www.nchc.gov.tw/RESEARCH/NWT/research.htm)

   Dr. Shin-jye Liang demonstrated the "Hydrodynamic Model 
System for the Tamshui River."  As the second largest river 
in Taiwan, the Tamshui River flows through the Metropolis of 
the Great Taipei area and has become highly polluted, despite 
costly attempts to clean it up.  The hydrodynamic model as 
applied to the Tamshui River simulates flows under tidal 
forcing, upstream inflows and interactions between fresh 
water and seawater.  Model predictions are illustrated in a 
distributed and interactive visualization environment (DIVE). 
This Internet-based visualization environment uses both VRML 
and OpenGL to display simulated results along with surrounding 
terrain in a 3D virtual world.  It also uses CORBA to support 
distributed communications and collaboration.  His ultimate 
goal is to create a computational infrastructure for 
predicting and visualizing flow scenarios, for forecasting 
natural disaster, and managing ecosystem.  Such a framework
builds on the integration of the geographic information system 
(GIS), hydrodynamic and pollutant transport models, and 
visualization tools as well as virtual reality.

   Dr. Hsien-Chie Cheng presented his team's work on 
"crashworthiness simulation" of a new-model car manufactured 
by Yulong, the domestic motor company.  Profiles of simulated 
crashes from a 50 kmph frontal impact into a rigid flat wall 
during a 0.07 seconds span were generated using 
supercomputers as well as the nonlinear transient FEM code: 
LSTC-DYNA3D. (http://www.nchc.gov.tw/RESEARCH/solid/Cindex.html)

   Dr. Chang-Huain Hsieh's presentation was on 
"structure-based drug design model."  Using the design of 
antagonists for the receptor of the trans-membrane protein, 
endothelin, as an example, he illustrated the strategies 
involved. (http://saturn.nchc.gov.tw:9091/mmtool/drug.mpeg)

   Dr. Shih-Hung Chen has developed a simulation environment 
and analysis tool (SEAT) as an internet-based collaborative 
environment for the dynamic computation of plasma physics.  
His system now incorporates a visualization module and 
computing solvers, making it even more versatile for sharing 
computing resources.(http://summer.nchc.gov.tw/SEAT)

   Being at the exhibit floor, the team had the good fortune 
to witness the historic delivery of 2.4 Gbps packet-over-
SONET transmission.  It is a record speed, surpassing the line 
rate for HDTV demonstration at Internet2 fall meeting just 
one month earlier.  Next generation Internet technologies are 
richly represented at this year's exhibits.  While there, the 
group had the opportunity to conduct network measurement for 
TANet2's link to the exhibition center.

Domestic Backbone of TANet2 Due for An Upgrade

   The TANet2 backbone will be upgraded and in full operation 
by February 15.  In the new two-star configuration, the line 
rate connecting the two is 300 Mbps, between NCHC-PoP and 
MOE-PoP.  Reaching out to other PoPs will be 20 to 30 Mbps 
each.  This bandwidth is sliced from a 60-90 Mbps allocated 
for each PoP that is on both TANet2 and TANet.  The latter 
is the educational network that services universities and 
colleges.  Its inclusion of K-12 schools during the past year 
created so much congestion that this new upgrade is but an 
interim remedy until another T3 replaces the current 
configuration and supplements the other T3 already in place.  
Chung-Hwa Telecom, the carrier responsible for the TANet2 
upgrade, will complete the installation and testing by 
January 31 while our vendor, Hitron Technology, continues 
to service the new backbone.  Hitron, which also runs HTnet, 
is an ISP that won the bid to service TANet2 and mans the 
Network Operation Center since last May.

Twenty-six Institutions now on TANet2

   Six more institutions signed on to TANet2, bring the 
total to twenty six.  The new additions came after a new 
round of applications were submitted in October.  Members 
of the TANet2 Policy Committee served as reviewers.  It 
marked the first time that an institution in the arts, 
Tainan National College of the Arts, was accepted.  In all, 
most universities that emphasize research are now on TANet2.  
It is expected that after the upgrade of the domestic 
backbone, more institutions will apply.  An announcement of 
RFP will be issued in March, 2000.

Use of Native Multicast Gaining Momentum

   It took several months for network engineers at 
universities to warm up to native multicast, although it was 
made available since September 3, 1999.  By establishing 
peering relationship with vBNS border gateway routers with 
MBGP, TANet2 has gained access to multicast sessions from our 
peered networks.  As TANet2 PoPs that deployed multicast 
increases from four to the current eight, and with two other 
universities joining in, users become more aware of the power 
of the multicast.  Chief among its many applications is video 
conferencing.  Many other application are being developed and 
tested, including web-casting, distance education, or 
distance learning.  We anticipate the number of institutions 
adopting this bandwidth conservation service to increase 
rapidly.  Traffics generated from unicast still outnumber 
multicast by a very wide margin.

NCTS to Provide Video-conferencing and Webcast Services

   The National Center for Theoretical Sciences, established 
under the sponsorship of the National Science Council, Taiwan, 
is experimenting with the provision of video conferencing and 
broadcasting over TANet2.  The Center, which is devoted to 
advancing research in mathematics and theoretical physics, 
has member scientists spread out throughout the island.  The 
Center encourages cross-disciplinary and inter-regional 
cooperation.  It also emphasizes international exchanges and 
global collaboration.  With programs in a wide-ranging area, 
scholars affiliated with the Center find it inconvenient to 
attend the many gatherings.  These include lectures by 
visiting scientists, both from overseas and from many locales 
in Taiwan, delivered at conferences, seminars and workshops.  
Making such sessions available to scientists and students who 
otherwise cannot attend is a wonderful undertaking.  The Real 
System will be adopted for the initial development.  When it 
is made available, the content is expected to encompass Number 
Theory, Dynamical Systems, Geometric Analysis, Discrete 
Mathematics, Scientific Computation, High Energy Physics, 
Condensed Matter Physics, Atomic and Molecular Physics, 
Mathematical Physics and Biophysics.

Web-Based Database of GAGs-Binding Proteins under 
Development

   Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) is an entity that exerts 
functions when bound to cellular proteins.  Dr. Chang-Huang 
Hsieh of the NCHC is constructing a database for scientists 
working in this field, to be accessed via the Internet through 
a browser.  A graphical user interface (GUI) is being 
developed under Java.  It incorporates the popular viewers 
RasMol and Chime in its design and permits users to access 
a host of biomolecular databases that the NCHC and others 
services.  These include GenBank, Protein Data Bank, 
Structural Classification of Proteins, Protein Information 
Resources, PROSITE and Swiss-Prot.

   The database has about 40 records presently.  It contains 
all the textual information concerning the sugar moiety of 
the GAGs and the structural information of the proteins each 
GAGs binds to.  Information about chemical structure formula, 
metabolic pathways, distribution in the body is being 
collected by means of data-mining process.  Knowledge 
discovery is a much needed technique that yields useful 
information for researchers relying on these databases for 
predicting the protein structure or for designing drugs.

Correlation between Earthquake and Groundwater Level Studied

   Before the Chi-Chi killer quake hit Taiwan at midnight, 
September 21, 1999 many observed significant changes in the 
water level in wells some distance away from the epicenter.  
These changes took place as early as 24 hours prior to the 
quake.  The township of Chi-Chi is at the Chelungpu fault.  
After the quake and aftershocks, there was great displacement 
owing to ground motions.  The maximum horizontal displacement 
was 7.1 m whereas the maximum vertical displacement was 4.5 
m.  Fluctuations in water level collected from about 50 wells 
were also very great.  The level rose as much as 7 m and fell 
as much as 11 m.  If these changes reflect a direct correlation, 
then the magnitude of fluctuations in groundwater level is 
potentially a good indicator of the severity of an earthquake.  
It also serves as a good warning signal.  Ms. Chia-Chen Kuo 
at the NCHC is developing a web-based system that will take 
in real-time measurements from the wells and render them in 
virtual reality.  In addition, the same system will be used 
to treat surface and subsurface data collected for the 
Chelungpu fault, rendering the data sets in 3D.  The 
visualization system will be used for education and training 
for workers in hazard mitigation.
