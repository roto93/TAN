                       Announcement of Opportunity 

The European VLBI Network (via JIVE) has received an award from the
European Commission's Access to Research Infrastructures Programme (an
action of the EC's Improving Human Potential Programme).  The contract
will run for a period of 3 years and is designed to support access to
the EVN for outside users who satisfy the following criteria:

(a) they are not affiliated to the EVN institutes (including MPIfR, JIVE
    NFRA, JBO, OSO, IRA, OAN, HUT, TCfA, BKG & Paris Obs within Europe)

(b) they are affiliated to an Institute located with the EU or 
    the recently enlarged Associated States (* see footnote below 
    for full details)  

(c) they are associated with an EVN project for which they are 
    the principal investigator (or as a co-investigator provided 
    the PI also satisfies points (a) and (b)).   

The support provided by this programme includes: (i) absentee
observing/correlation at the EVN observatories & JIVE, (ii) assistance
from EVN Support Scientists located at JIVE w.r.t. project planning,
scheduling and data analysis and (iv) full financial support for users
who wish to visit JIVE or the EVN observatories in order to observe or 
process data. 
 
EVN users must first obtain observing time on the EVN before they are
eligible for this support. To apply for time on the EVN please refer to
the EVN Call for Proposals:

           www.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de/EVN/EVNcall.

A full description of the EVN and JIVE is available at:
