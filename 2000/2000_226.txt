Dear colleagues,
	Prof. J.R. Jokipii (Regents' Professor of Planetary
Sciences and Astronomy, University of Arizona) will give a
talk at the Institute of Astronomy, NCU.

Title: Random Magnetic Field Lines in Astrophyiscal and Space Plasmas

Time: 14:00 27th Oct. 2000 (Friday)

Place: S4-1013 (NCU)

Abstract:
Turbulence in astrophysical and space plasmas produces random
magnetic fields which have a number of unique and interesting
physical effects. One of the more important of these effects
is the random braiding and tangling of the magnetic lines of
force caused by the fluid motions. The braiding and tangling
gives rise to important effects on fluid motions and fundamentally
changes the transport of energetic charged particles, or cosmic
rays. The physics of these random magnetic field lines and their
effects on charged particles will be discussed and relevant,
illustrative, comparisons of observations and theory will be shown.


	see you friday,
	Chung-Ming Ko
