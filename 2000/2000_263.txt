          EDITORIAL: Why a cluster newsletter .. ? Our motivation

The field of star clusters, open or globular, is expanding rapidly on the 
observational side, thanks to high-accuracy astrometric surveys, available  
(HIPPARCOS) or  forthcoming (DIVA, FAME), to extra-galactic studies (starting
with the LMC), and to cosmological surveys. On the theoretical side, progress
in stellar evolution models and  computational N-body techniques, allowing 
star-by-star modelling of open clusters and, soon, globulars, already  
rejuvenate the field. 

We anticipate more and more activity in the near future in this area of 
research, hence a  need to disseminate summaries of activity covering 
 all aspects of work on star cluster: refereed publications naturally, but 
also forthcoming conferences,  recent PhD summaries,  planned surveys, links 
to relevant databases, or job(s) opportunities. 

We therefore propose to collect and maintain a list of forthcoming contribu-
tions to refereed journals, conference proceedings, and the likes, which 
will be posted at the url advertised at the top of this page. We would follow
 in the steps of successful newsletters, such as the star formation newsletter
maintained by Bo Reipurth, or the dwarf galaxy newsletter of Elias Brinks and
 Eva Grebel. 

SCYON, as we propose to call the newsletter, will be published initially 
once every two months. If the number of contributions justifies a 
monthly instalment, we would move toward more frequent issues in order to 
keep the newsletter relatively short, manageable for us, and up-to-date. 

 We would in the first instance to run a relatively simple newsletter, 
however one long-term objective is to link articles by object to the 
WEBDA (url http://obswww.unige.ch/webda/) database developed by one of us 
(J-CM). The intention is to allow users to navigate in the newsletter library
 between research papers as well as the database. 

Interested? If you are,  and would like to contribute to the newsletter, 
please write to us at the address 

                       SCYON@ari.uni-heidelberg.de
