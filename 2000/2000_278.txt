Session 1:  Colloquium (2:00 - 3:00 pm)
 
            SPEAKER: Pre-Dr. Lai Shi-Ping
                     (University of Illinois)
            TITLE:   "Interferometric Mapping of Magnetic Fields 
                      in Star-forming Regions"
            
            Abstract:
            Magnetic fields are thought to play a significant role in all stages
of star formation, however there are few observations that measure
magnetic fields at the relevant physical scale for the star formation
process.  Using the polarimeter on the BIMA interferometer, we have
conducted the largest survey of linearly polarized dust emission in
star-forming regions at 1.3-mm wavelength.  Our observations achieve 
high resolutions up to 2 arcsec, which is more than 5 times better than
most previous observations with single-dish telescopes.
The improvement in angular resolution enables us to investigate
detailed magnetic field structures at the scale of protostellar cores,
and then assess the relative importance of the ordered field and the
turbulent field, which provides an opportunity to test theoretical models
and simulations of star formation.  Results from several molecular clouds
will be discussed.
