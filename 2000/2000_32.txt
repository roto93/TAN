DATES : 
18th-22nd September 2000
 

PLACE : 
LORENTZ CENTER (LEIDEN OBSERVATORY, THE NETHERLANDS)


AIM : 
Optical/infrared interferometry is the technique of coherently
combining light from several ground or space-based telescopes to
obtain imaging information at a resolution orders of magnitude larger
than obtainable with a single telescope.  Such a high resolution
explores a unique observational regime and therefore should provide
new insights into a wide range of astrophysical questions.  At the
moment two major European projects are being conceived.  Firstly, the
European Southern Observatory is currently building the VLT
Interferometer (VLTI), which consists of four 8-meter diameter
telescopes and three 1.8-meter diameter telescopes.  Secondly, the
European Space Agency is currently carrying out a system level study
on IRSI/Darwin, a mission to carry out infrared interferometry in
space. The aim is to build an interferometer that consists
of 6 free flying 1.8-m telescopes and is capable of detecting
earth-like planets orbiting nearby stars. 

The aim of the present workshop is to give the attendees a solid
overview of 

(i) the theoretical principles of optical/IR interferometry
(ii) the atmosphere 
(ii) the existing instruments
(iii) science issues relevant to interferometry 
(iv) the VLTI and DARWIN project 


AUDIENCE : 
People accepted will be from universities, technical laboratories and
industry with a strong interest in this field. The lectures will be a
level suitable for early PhD.
The number of attendees will be limited to 35.

SUMMER SCHOOL VENUE :
   Lorentz Center :
The summer school will be hosted by the Lorentz Center located within the 
cluster of science buildings of Leiden University. 
   
   Travel to Leiden :
Leiden is located in the west of The Netherlands, and can be reached 
conveniently by rail from Amsterdam Schiphol Airport and all major cities. 
Trains from the airport run every 15 minutes and take about 20 minutes (cost
one way around NLG 9.50) 

   City of Leiden : 
Leiden is one of the historical cities of The Netherlands hosting the 
oldest Dutch University. In its center numerous museums are found, 
notably the Naturalis Museum, the National Museum for the History of 
Science Boerhaave , the National Museum of Antiquities and the City 
Museum of Art De Lakenhal . 
As a student town it has also a great variety  of restaurants. 
More information about Leiden can be found on the Leiden Observatory pages.

which will include tea, coffee and lunch during the meeting, stationery ...


ACCOMMODATION : 
Arrangements are being made to book single and double rooms in hotels in Leiden


GRANTS :
A limited number of grants to partly support the travel and/or registration 
will be available.
