Subject: Newsletter of Commsion 28

Dear All,

It seems that we had some e-mail trouble in sending the
IAU Commission 28 Newsletter the other day.
The mail may not have reached about a half of our members.

Accordingly, I would like to re-send the Newsletter.
Apologies for those who receive the same thing twice.

With best wishes,
Sadanori Okamura

President, IAU Commission 28

Dear Members of Commission 28,

This is the first newsletter from the new President, which summarizes

This was a joint meeting of Division VIII and its two Commissions, 28
and 47. The reports and approval of new officers of the two Commissions
took place first, and are reported separately in this volume.


Division VIII Officers, Triennium 2000-2003

The Division VIII Board includes the President, vice President and past
President of each of the two Commissions, and a Division President who
is nominated by the Board. These appointments were approved at the
meeting. In addition, three additional nominations were made and
approved at the meeting. The new Board of Division VIII is as follows:

PRESIDENT:  V. Trimble

BOARD:  F. Bertola  (Division President-Elect; PP Com 28)
        M. Birkinshaw (Division webmaster)
        S. Lilly  (vice President, Commission 47)
        S. Okamura  (President, Commission 28)
        J. Peacock  (President, Commission 47)
   　　 E. Sadler  (vice President, Commission 28)
 　　   P. Shaver  (past President, Division VIII)
        A. Szalay  (past President, Commission 47)


Scientific Meetings

A summary was presented of the scientific meetings that had been
supported/sponsored by Division VIII and its two Commissions over the
past triennium: 11 Symposia, 5 Colloquia and 3 Joint Discussions. Of
these, the following took place at the General Assembly in Manchester:
Symp. 201: New Cosmological Data and the Values of the Fundamental
           Parameters
Symp. 204: The Extragalactic Infrared Background and its Cosmological
           Implications
Symp. 205: Galaxies and their Constituents at the Highest Angular
           Resolutions
JD 8: Oxygen Abundances in Old Stars, Implications to Nucleosynthesis &
      Cosmology
JD 9: Cold Gas and Dust at High Redshift
JD 10: Cluster Mergers and their Connection to Radio Sources

The following four meetings are supported for 2001:
Extragalactic Star Clusters  (E. Grebel; Pucon, Chile)
Planetary Nebulae   (M. Dopita; Canberra, Australia)
Cosmic Masers   (V. Migenes; Rio de Janiero, Brazil)
AGN Surveys    (A. Mickaelian; Byurakan, Armenia)


Discussion

A number of points were raised for general discussion:

a) Communications. A renewed effort will be made to reach all members of
both Commissions by e-mail, so that regular newsletters can be sent, and
a new and more comprehensive website will be established.  Susan Simkin
agreed to act as email coordinator.
b) Organization of the Division. As in previous years, it was decided to
leave the Divisional structure unchanged, with no new Commissions
proposed. The  intention of Div XI to establish a new Commission on
Astroparticle Physics was supported. The possibility of creating new
Working Groups was discussed, and will be further explored in upcoming
newsletters.
c) Reports on Astronomy. The continuing need for such reports as
reference sources for both researchers and historians was generally
agreed, and possible formats were discussed.
d) Format of the General Assembly. There was a brief discussion about
the structure of the General Assembly, in particular whether somewhat
more time should be made available for meetings organized by the
Divisions and Commissions.

The President thanked the Board members for the pleasant and productive
collaboration over the past triennium, and welcomed his successor
Virginia Trimble and the new members of the Board. He also thanked the
General Secretary, Assistant General Secretary and IAU Secretariat for
their help on administrative matters. In turn, the participants of the
meeting thanked the President for his efforts over the past three years.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Reports of the Business Meeting of Commission 28 held on 11 August 2000

A list of 86 new members to be admitted to the IAU at the General Assembly,
who had expressed desire to be members of Commission 28, was approved. To
this list the name of Areg Mickaelian (Armenia), already an IAU member,
has to be added following his request to the President.

Members of the Commission before 1997 GA were 668, and 97 new members were
approved at 1997 GA, totaling to 765. The three-year effort, carried out
by the Vice President, to update the membership of the commission resulted
in the following:

Those who want to be members                          642
Those who no more wish to be members                   46
Lette and/or e-mail not returned, but no answer        47

The following officers for the triennium 2000-2003 has been approved:


Sadanori Okamura                   Japan,  President
Elaine Sadler                      Australia, Vice President
Chantal Balkowski-Mauger           France
Francesco Bertola                  Italy
James Binney                       UK

Simon Lilly                        Canada
Zhen-Long Zou                      China PR

The President expressed his appreciation for the outgoing members Sandip
Chakrabarti (India), Michael Feast (South Africa), John Huchra (USA),
Virginia Trimble (USA), Richard Wielebinski (Germany) and welcomed the
new President and the new members of the OC.

A discussion has taken place on how to name newly discovered companions
to M31. It has been decided to wait for the recommendations from the IAU
Task Group on Astronomical Designations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Venues of next two GAs

25th General Assembly: 13-26 July 2003 in Sydney, Australia

26th General Assembly: 2006 in Prague, Czech Republic, exact dates TBD

-------------------------------------------------------------------
4. The Gruber Prize - The Executive Committee voted unanimously to
associate the IAU with this new prize in Cosmology, to be given in
2000 (to P James E Peebles and Allan Sandage) and each year thereafter
(normally a single prize of $150,000), accompanied by one or more
fellowships in cosmology and related sciences to be award to one or
more young astronomers from developing countries to enable them to
work with colleagues in more developed countries.  The IAU will,
in the future, appoint 4 of the 7 members of the committee to select
winners.  Deadline for applications or nominations for the first
round of fellowships (to be awarded early in 2001) will be quite
soon, so be thinking of a young colleague who might be eligible.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Deadline 15 March 2001.

PROPOSALS for symposia and colloquia requesting IAU sponsorship in
2002 should reach President of appropriate sponsoring Division by
this date.

LETTERS OF INTENT for symposia and joint discussions for the Sydney
GA have the same deadline (the LOC has to pay by the room for
convention facilities and wants a preliminary decision from the Exec
Comm meeting of June 2001 on roughly how many of each there will be
and for how many days).  Symposia can run 3-4 days (3 or 3 1/2 being
preferred) and JDs 1/2, 1, max 1.5 days at the GA.  Free standing
symposia and colloquia can run 3-5 days; colloquia tend to be a bit
shorter than symposia.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
6. Symposia and colloquia to be sponsored in 2001:

Planetary Nebulae, Canberra, 19-23 Nov
Extragalactic Star Clusters, Pucon Chile 12-16 March
Cosmic Masers, Rio de Janiero, 5-10 March
Stellar Atmospheres, Uppsala Sweden, late June
Pulsating stars and stellar astrophysics, Leuven BE 26-31 July
AGN Surveys, Byurakan Armenia, 19-23 June

--------------------------------------------------------------------
7. New or restructured Working Groups that might be of interest to
members:

Future Large Scale Facilities (both ground and space) - chair
is probably Richard Scillizzi.

"new messenger astronomy" (this is not the name - it includes dark
matter, neutrinos, gravitational radiation, very high energy cosmic
rays and gamma rays, etc) Initial organizing by G.Srinivasan, the
new President of Div IX (High Energy Astrophysics & Astronomy from
Space)
