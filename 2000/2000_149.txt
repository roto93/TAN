1.  ROCHESTER ANTICIPATED PRESS COVERAGE 

We are aware that astronomers who miss the meeting
are often questioned by students and friends concerning 
the findings reported in the media.  However, we do not 
post the press releases from the meeting on the Web because 
we supply information to the media, we don't compete with 
them in getting the information out.  Press releases on 
individual papers and findings are prepared by the author 
institutions and not by the AAS. 

Shortly before each meeting, the list of press conferences 
is posted on the AAS web site, with references to the 
corresponding meeting papers. 

You can access the Rochester Anticipated Press Conferences 
through the online Program:  

http://www.aas.org/meetings/aas196/program/index.html

or directly at:
