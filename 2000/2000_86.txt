Dear CosPA colleagues,

The CosPa Journal Club meeting this week has been cancelled.
But, for those who feel sorry about skipping the journal 
club, I would like to announce a talk very relevant to the CosPA.
Since it is on Monday, probably the Asiaans will have time conflict.
But, if you want to attend the following talk, please contact 
Emily (emily@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw) for the transportation and a lunch 
box.
