> The 21-cm line from atomic hydrogen was detected in 1951 after a
> concerted, world-wide effort inspired by the prediction by van de Hulst
> and Oort of the frequency and significance of the transition.  This
> detection opened the field of radio spectroscopy, and quickly led to the
> first large scale mapping of the Milky Way disk.  In the decades that
> followed, this line has been used in both Galactic and Extra-galactic
> astronomy as a tracer of the distribution and velocity field of the
> interstellar medium.  Studies of the 21-cm line in emission and absorption
> laid the foundations of the multi-phase paradigm of the interstellar
> medium.  The last five years have seen another major advance through an
> on-going project of 21-cm mapping of the Galactic Plane with unprecedented
> resolution by an international consortium of astronomers working with
> telescopes in Canada, Australia, and the United States. At the same time
> HI observations are becoming increasingly relevant to studies of the
> interstellar medium of external galaxies, and the next generation of
> cm-wave radio telescopes will target studies of HI in galaxies in the
> high-redshift universe to elucidate the formation and evolution of
> galaxies.
>
> The occasion of the 50th anniversary of the detection of the HI line,
> provides an opportunity to review the success of past HI studies and the
> science that has grown out of HI observations of gas in the Milky Way and
> other galaxies, to discuss the astrophysical impact of the ambitious
> observations underway, and to explore the potential of HI science for the
> future.  The meeting will be held in Penticton, British Columbia, from the
> 20th to the 26th of October, 2001, hosted by the Dominion Radio
> Astrophysical Observatory of the Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics,
> National Research Council of Canada.
