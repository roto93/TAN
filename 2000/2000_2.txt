Previous searches for atomic gas in our Galaxy's dwarf spheroidal
companions have not been complete enough to settle the question of
whether or not these galaxies have HI, especially in their outer
parts.  We present new observations of the dwarf spheroidals Sextans,
Leo~I, Ursa Minor, and Draco, using the NRAO 140-foot telescope to
search much farther in radius than has been done before.  The new data
go out to at least 2.5 times the core radius in all cases, and well
beyond even the tidal radius in two cases.  These observations give HI
column density limits of 2--6$\times 10^{17}$ cm$^{-2}$.  Unless HI is
quite far from the galaxies' centers, we conclude that these galaxies
don't contain significant amounts of atomic gas at the present time.
We discuss whether the observations could have missed some atomic gas.

HST F555W and F814W photometry of a portion of the WLM galaxy are
presented.  The distance modulus is determined via fitting of the
entire color-magnitude diagram to be $(m-M)_0 = 24.88 \pm 0.09$, which
is consistent with the RGB tip distance.  The galaxy's measurable star
formation history appears to have begun no more than 12 Gyr ago, with
about half of WLM's total star formation (by mass) formed before 9 Gyr
ago.  The star formation rate gradually decreased, until a recent
increase in activity starting between 1 and 2.5 Gyr ago.  This is
still continuing to the present time, and is concentrated in the bar
of the galaxy, as shown by the difference in recent star formation
rates in the three WF chips.

We present deep $BVRI$ CCD photometry of the stars in the dwarf
irregular galaxy SagDIG.  The color-magnitude diagrams of the measured
stars in SagDIG show a blue plume which consists mostly of young
stellar populations, and a well-defined red giant branch (RGB).  The
foreground reddening of SagDIG is estimated to be $E(B-V)=0.06$.  The
tip of the RGB is found to be at $I_{\rm TRGB} = 21.55 \pm 0.10$ mag.
{From} this the distance to this galaxy is estimated to be $d =
1.18\pm 0.10 $ Mpc. This result, combined with its velocity
information, shows that it is a member of the Local Group.  The mean
metallicity of the red giant branch is estimated to be [Fe/H] $< -2.2$
dex. This shows that SagDIG is one of the most metal-poor galaxies.
Total magnitudes of SagDIG ($<r_H (= 107$ arcsec)) are derived to be
$B^T=13.99$ mag, $V^T=13.58$ mag, $R^T=13.19$ mag, and $I^T=1 2.88$
mag, and the corresponding absolute magnitudes are $M_B=-11.62$ mag,
$M_V=-11.97$ mag, $M_R=-12.33$ mag, and $M_I=-12.60$ mag.  Surface
brightness profiles of the central part of SagDIG are approximately
fit by a King model with a core concentration parameter $c = \log (r_t
/ r_c ) \approx 0.6$, and those of the outer part follow an
exponential law with a scale length of 37 arcsec.  The central surface
brightness is measured to be $\mu_B (0) = 24.21 $ mag arcsec$^{-2}$
and $\mu_V (0) =23.91 $ mag arcsec$^{-2}$.  The magnitudes and colors
of the brightest blue and red stars in SagDIG (BSG and RSG) are
measured to be, respectively, $<V(3)>_{BSG} = 19.89\pm 0.13$ mag,
$<(B-V)(3)>_{BSG} = 0.08\pm 0.07$ mag, $<V(3 )>_{RSG} = 20.39\pm 0.10$
mag, and $<(B-V)(3)>_{RSG} = 1.29\pm 0.12$ mag.  The corresponding
absolute magnitudes are derived to be $<M_V(3)>_{BSG} = -5.66$ mag and
$<M_V(3)>_{RSG} = -5.16$ mag, which are about one magnitude fainter
than those expected from conventional correlations with galaxy
luminosity.

As part of our survey for substructure in the Milky Way halo as traced
by giant stars, and to look for tidal stellar debris in the halo
viable for measurement of the Galactic mass potential with the Space
Interferometry Mission (SIM), we explore the distribution of stars
beyond the nominal tidal radius of, but still associated with, the
Carina dwarf spheroidal galaxy. We make use of the photometric
technique described in Majewski et al.\ (1999b, AJ, submitted) to
identify giant star candidates at the distance and metallicity of the
Carina dwarf spheroidal across the entire extent of a photometric
survey covering some 2.2 deg$^2$ on and around Carina.  These
Carina-associated giant candidates are identified by a combination of
(1) their $M-DDO51$ colors, which are a measure of both surface
gravity and metallicity at given $M-T_2$ colors, and (2) by locations
in the color-magnitude diagram commensurate with the Carina red giant
branch in the core of the galaxy.  The density distribution of the
extratidal giant candidates bears resemblance to the outer isopleths
of Carina presented by Irwin \& Hatzidimitriou (1995, MNRAS, 277,
1354).  However, in contrast to previous, {\it statistical}
star-counting approaches, we can pinpoint {\it actual},
remotely-situated Carina stars individually.  Because we can exclude
the foreground veil of dwarf stars, our approach allows greater
sensitivity and the ability to map the detailed two-dimensional
distribution of extended Carina populations to much larger radii,
while utilizing smaller aperture telescopes, than other techniques.
Moreover, we identify candidate lists of widely displaced
Carina-associated stars bright enough for spectroscopic studies of
large-scale dynamical and metallicity properties of the system, and
for astrometric study by SIM. We obtained spectroscopy for three such
``extratidal'' stars and from their radial velocities conclude that
all three are associated with Carina.

While a single King profile matches our derived Carina core density
profile, we confirm previous claims for a break in the density
fall-off at about 20 arcmin.  Beyond this radius, a more gradual
fall-off as $r^{-\gamma}$, with $1 < \gamma < 2$, to $r \ge 80$
arcmin, is found. If the existence of density profile breaks is a
signature of the predominance of unbound stars, and if we adopt the
nominal tidal radius of 28 arcmin previously found for Carina, then it
would appear that we have identified a substantial extratidal
population from Carina.  If these $r
\mathrel{\hbox{\rlap{\hbox{\lower5pt\hbox{$\sim$}}}\hbox{$>$}}} 20$
arcmin stars are truly now unbound from the galaxy, we estimate from
the relative stellar density distribution a fractional destruction
rate for Carina from tidal stripping of order $\begin{pmatrix} {df
\over dt}\end{pmatrix} = 0.27$ Gyr$^{-1}$.  This is among the highest
rates expected for the Milky Way dwarf spheroidals apart from
Sagittarius.  The existence of such extended populations of
Carina-associated stars may have important implications for the
existence of large dark matter contents in dwarf spheroidals, as well
as for the evolution of the Milky Way halo.
  
Finally, we find that the ``background density'' of what are likely to
be predominantly random, metal-poor halo field giants maintains a
rather flat count-magnitude relation out to the distance of Carina, in
keeping with $R^{-3}$ density laws for the Galactic halo.

The {\it Hubble Space Telescope} WFPC2 camera has been used to image
Andromeda~II, a dwarf spheroidal (dSph) companion to M31.  The
resulting color-magnitude (c-m) diagrams reveal the morphology of the
horizontal branch (HB) in this dwarf galaxy.  We find that like
Andromeda~I, and like most of the Galactic dSph companions, the HB
morphology of And~II is predominantly red.  Unlike And~I, however,
there is no evidence for a radial gradient in HB morphology in the
And~II data.  Based on a comparison with a combination of standard
Galactic globular cluster c-m diagrams scaled to reproduce the And~II
mean abundance and abundance dispersion, we interpret the observed HB
morphology of And~II as indicating that at least 50\% of the total
stellar population is younger than the age of the globular clusters.
This inference is strengthened by the small number of confirmed
upper-AGB carbon stars in And~II\@.  The relatively faint luminosities
(M$_{bol}$ $\approx$ --4.1) of these stars, however, suggest an age or
ages nearer 6--9 Gyr, rather than 1--3 Gyr, for this population.  On
the other hand, the existence of blue HB and RR~Lyrae variable stars
in And~II argues for the existence of an additional old (age $>$ 10
Gyr) population in this dSph.  Thus And~II has had an extended epoch
of star formation like many of the Galactic dSphs.  The mean magnitude
of the blue HB in And~II suggests (m--M)$_{0}$ = 24.17 $\pm$ 0.06 and
that And~II is 125 $\pm$ 60 kpc closer than M31 along the
line-of-sight.  This confirms the association of And~II with M31,
rather than with M33 to which And~II lies closer on the sky.  The true
distance of And~II from the center of M31 is between $\sim$160 and
$\sim$230 kpc, comparable to the Galactocentric distances of Fornax
and of the Leo dSphs.  With the current samples of dSph companions,
the size of the Galaxy's and M31's dSph satellite systems are
comparable, with outer radii of order 250 kpc.  The And~II red giant
branch colors yield a mean abundance of $<$[Fe/H]$>$ = --1.49 $\pm$
0.11 and a surprisingly large internal abundance spread, which can be
characterized by $\sigma_{int}$([Fe/H]) $\approx$ 0.36 dex.  Both
these values are in good agreement with the recent ground-based
spectroscopic study of C\^{o}t\'{e} et al.\ [1999, AJ, 118, 1645].
The And~II abundance dispersion found here is considerably larger than
that derived for And~I from an identical analysis of similar data
($\sigma_{int}$([Fe/H]) = 0.21 dex).  Thus despite having very similar
luminosities and mean metal abundances, these two M31 dSph companions
have clearly had different chemical evolution histories.  We find that
we cannot model the abundance distribution in And~II with single
component simple chemical enrichment models.  However, we can
reproduce the form of the distribution if we assume two components,
each with a simple model abundance distribution.  The ``metal-poor''
component has mean abundance log($<\!z\!>$/$z_{sun}$) = --1.6, while
the ``metal-rich'' one has mean abundance log($<\!z\!>$/$z_{sun}$) =
--0.95 and is outnumbered by the metal-poor population by a ratio of
$\sim$2.3 to 1.  We end by concluding that the diversity of
evolutionary histories evident among the Galactic dSph companions is
now also firmly established among the dSph satellites of M31.  An
Appendix discusses minor revisions to our earlier And~I results that
arise from the calibration and analysis techniques adopted in this
paper.  In particular, our comparisons with ground-based photometry
indicate that the zeropoints for the WFPC2 $F450W$ to $B$
transformation should be modified, by 0.055 mag, to produce fainter
$B$ magnitudes and thus redder $B-V$ colors.  \par

The purpose of this study is to carry out a thorough investigation of
the changes in morphology of the red giant branch (RGB) of Galactic
globular clusters (GGC) as a function of metallicity, in the \( V,I \)
bands. To this aim, two key points are developed in the course of the
analysis.

\textbf{(a)} Using our photometric \( V,I \) database for Galactic
globular clusters (the largest homogeneous data sample to date;
Rosenberg et al., 1999, AJ, in press -- astro-ph/9907394) \emph{we
measure a complete set of metallicity indices}, based on the
morphology and position of the red-giant branch. In particular, we
provide here the first calibration of the \( S \), \( \Delta V_{1.1}
\) and \( \Delta V_{1.4} \) indices in the \( (V-I,V) \) plane. We
show that our indices are internally consistent, and we calibrate each
index in terms of metallicity, both on the Zinn \& West (1984) and the
Carretta \& Gratton (1997) scales. Our new calibrations of the \(
(V-I)_{0,\rm g} \), \( \Delta V_{1.2} \) , \( (V-I)_{-3.0} \) and \(
(V-I)_{-3.5} \) indices are consistent with existing relations.

\textbf{(b)} Using a grid of selected RGB fiducial points, \emph{we
define a function in the \( (V-I)_{0},M_{I},\rm [Fe/H] \) space which
is able to reproduce the whole set of GGC giant branches in terms of a
single parameter} (the metallicity).  As a first test, we show that
the function is able to predict the correct trend of our observed
indices with metallicity.

The usage of this function will improve the current determinations of
metallicity and distances within the Local Group, since it allows to
easily map \( (V-I)_{0},M_{I} \) coordinates into \( [{\rm
Fe/H}],M_{I} \) ones. To this aim the ``synthetic'' RGB distribution
is generated both for the currently used Lee, Demarque and Zinn (1990)
distance scale, and for the most recent results on the RR~Lyr distance
scale.

Among the galaxies, which were included in the Atlas and Catalogue of
Interacting galaxies by Vorontsov-Veliaminov (hereafter VV) as
multiple systems (``nests'', ``chains'' and similarly looking
systems), there are many objects, where the interaction is not
evident. Some of them are single objects, including low-mass galaxies
with active star formation. In this work we present the description of
observations, data processing and results of the long-slit
spectrophotometry with the Russian 6\,m telescope of three VV-galaxies
looking like double or multiple systems, and H{\sc i} observation of
one of them in order to elucidate their nature, determine their
metallicity, kinematic properties and the evolution status. Galaxies
VV~432 and VV~747 are found to be dwarf systems with very low oxygen
abundance (O/H $\approx$~1/22 and 1/12 of the solar value,
respectively).  Their velocity curves indicate {quite} small rotation
with { respective} maximum velocities of about 60 and 80~km~s$^{-1}$,
what agrees with their low luminosities. The distance to VV~432 is
rather uncertain. If it is a member of Virgo Cluster, this is the most
metal-deficient known galaxy of this aggregate.  For galaxy VV~543 the
measured emission-line redshift 0.047 appeared ten times larger than
it was given in the original paper and is cited in databases. This
``system'' evidently represents an optical pair of two galaxies with
large velocity difference. The fainter western component is an H{\sc
ii}-galaxy, while the brighter one is an absorption-line early-type
galaxy with the radial velocity being 1600~km~s$^{-1}$ lower.

We present the results of a neutral hydrogen survey of 80 galaxies
from a statistical sample of 88 Blue Compact Galaxies (BCGs) selected
from the First and Second Byurakan objective prism surveys to have a
HII region-like spectrum, an equivalent width of the OIII $\lambda$
5007 line larger than $\sim$ 50 \AA, and a velocity $\leq$ 6000 km
s$^{-1}$. The overall detection rate is 68 \%.  HI masses range
between 2 $ \times 10^7 M_{\odot} $ and 5 $ \times 10^9 M_{\odot} $
with the HI mass distribution peaking at 2 $ \times 10^8
M_{\odot}$. The full width at half-maximum of the HI profile varies
between $\sim$ 50 km s$^{-1}$ and 160 km s$^{-1}$, with a mean of
$\sim$ 88 km s$^{-1}$. These small widths are characteristic of dwarf
galaxies. For comparison, we have also observed an additional 92 BCGs
with weaker star formation and/or larger distances, and/or interesting
astrophysical properties. These in general have larger widths and HI
masses.

Six examples of the compact, isolated \hi\ high--velocity clouds
(CHVCs) identified by Braun and Burton (1999, A\&A 341, 437), but only
marginally resolved in single--dish data, have been imaged with the
Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope. The 65 confirmed objects in this
class define a dynamically cold system, with a global minimum for the
velocity dispersion of only 70 km~s$^{-1}$, found in the Local Group
Standard of Rest. The population is in--falling at 100 km~s$^{-1}$
toward the Local Group barycenter. These objects have a characteristic
morphology, in which one or more compact cores is embedded in a
diffuse halo. The compact cores typically account for 40\% of the \hi\
line flux while covering some 15\% of the source area. The narrow line
width of all core components allows unambiguous identification of
these with the cool condensed phase of \hi, the CNM, with
kinetic temperature near 100~K, while the halos appear to represent a
shielding column of warm diffuse \hi, the WNM, with temperature
near 8000~K. We detect a core with one of the narrowest \hi\ emission
lines ever observed, with intrinsic FWHM of no more than 2~km~s$^{-1}$
and 75~K brightness. {From} a comparison of column and volume densities
for this feature we derive a distance in the range 0.5 to 1 Mpc. We
determine a metallicity for this same object of 0.04 to 0.07
solar. Comparably high distances are implied by demanding the
stability of objects with multiple cores, which show relative
velocities as large as 70~km~s$^{-1}$ on 30~arcmin scales. Many of the
compact cores show systematic velocity gradients along the major axis
of their elliptical extent which are well--fit by circular rotation in
a flattened disk system. Two out of three of the derived rotation
curves are well--fit by Navarro, Frenk, \& White (1997, ApJ 490, 493)
cold dark matter profiles. These kinematic signatures imply a high
dark--to--visible mass ratio of 10--50, for $D~=~0.7$~Mpc, which
scales as $1/D$. The implied dark matter halos provide a significant
contribution to the mass volume density within the central 2~kpc
(10~arcmin) of each source, providing a sufficient hydrostatic pressure
to allow CNM condensation. The CHVC properties are similar in many
respects to those of the Local Group dwarf irregular galaxies,
excepting the presence of a high surface brightness stellar
population.

We report the discovery of a significant old population in the dwarf
spheroidal \leoi\ as a result of a wide-area search with the ESO New
Technology Telescope.  Studies of the stellar content of Local Group
dwarf galaxies have shown the presence of an old stellar population in
almost all of the dwarf spheroidals. The only exception was \leoi,
which alone appeared to have delayed its initial star formation
episode until just a few Gyr ago.
%
The color-magnitude diagram of \leoi\ now reveals an extended
horizontal branch, unambiguously indicating the presence of an old,
metal-poor population in the outer regions of this galaxy. Yet we find
little evidence for a stellar population gradient, at least outside
$R>2^\prime$ ($0.16$\ kpc), since the old horizontal branch stars of
\leoi\ are radially distributed as their more numerous
intermediate-age helium-burning counterparts.  The discovery of a
definitely old population in the predominantly young dwarf spheroidal
galaxy \leoi\ points to a sharply defined first epoch of star
formation common to all of the Local Group dSph's as well as to the
halo of the Milky Way.

Metallicity is a key parameter that controls many aspects in the
formation and evolution of stars and galaxies.  In this review we
focus on the metal deficient galaxies, in particular the most
metal-poor ones, because they play a crucial r\^ole in the cosmic
scenery.  We first set the stage by discussing the difficult problem
of defining a global metallicity and how this quantity can be measured
for a given galaxy. The mechanisms that control the metallicity in a
galaxy are reviewed in detail and involve many aspects of modern
astrophysics: galaxy formation and evolution, massive star formation,
stellar winds, chemical yields, outflows and inflows etc. Because
metallicity roughly scales as the galactic mass, it is among the
dwarfs that the most metal-poor galaxies are found. The core of our
paper reviews the considerable progress made in our understanding of
the properties and the physical processes that are at work in these
objects. The question on how they are related and may evolve from one
class of objects to another is discussed.  While discussing metal-poor
galaxies in general, we present a more detailed discussion of a few
very metal-poor blue compact dwarf galaxies like IZw18.  Although most
of what is known relates to our local universe, we show that it
pertains to our quest for primeval galaxies and is connected to the
question of the origin of structure in the universe.  What do QSO
absorption lines and known distant galaxies tell us already? We
illustrate the importance of star-forming metal-poor galaxies for the
determination of the primordial helium abundance, their use as
distance indicator and discuss the possibility to detect nearly
metal-free galaxies at high redshift from Ly$\alpha$ emission.

The first results of the program carried out at the SAO RAS 6-m
telescope pursued for the search for the most low-metallicity blue
compact galaxies (BCGs) are presented. The results of
spectrophotometry for 10 galaxies from the Case and Hamburg/SAO
surveys are presented and discussed.  The methodics of candidate
selection is described in detail, as well as observations and data
reduction. For all observed galaxies the intensity of [OIII] line
$\lambda$4363 \AA, is measured, what allows to determine correctly the
temperature in super-giant HII regions, and to derive the abundances
of chemical elements.  The intensities of all detected emission lines
are measured in HII regions of studied galaxies. The abundances of
Oxygen and Neon are derived for all of them. Abundances of N, S, He,
Ar and Fe are derived as well for part of the galaxies. The Oxygen
abundance in 6 galaxies is determined with the accuracy of $\le$0.1
dex, and with larger uncertainties for the remaining objects. Six of
the 10 program BCGs have appeared to be low-metallicity objects, with
O/H $\le$1/10 of the solar value, that is 12+log(O/H)$\le$7.92. One of
the most metal-poor BCGs found in this study is HS~0837+4717 with
Oxygen abundance 12+log(O/H)$\le$7.7.  This BCG shows in its spectrum
some broad low-contrast components of nebular lines [OIII]
$\lambda$4959, 5007 \AA, evidencing to high-velocity gas motions in
the galaxy.

We present the results of optical spectroscopy of a newly discovered
H~II region residing in the H~I gas cloud located between the dwarf
irregular galaxy UGC~7636 and the giant elliptical galaxy NGC~4472 in
the Virgo Cluster.  By comparing UGC~7636 with dwarf irregular
galaxies in the field, we show that the H~I cloud must have originated
from UGC~7636 because (1) the oxygen abundance of the cloud agrees
with that expected for a galaxy with the blue luminosity of UGC~7636,
and (2) $M_{H I}/L_B$ for UGC~7636 becomes consistent with the
measured oxygen abundance of the cloud if the H~I mass of the cloud is
added back into UGC~7636.  It is likely that tides from NGC~4472 first
loosened the H~I gas, after which ram--pressure stripping removed the
gas from UGC~7636.

The discovery of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, which is being tidally
disrupted by and merging with the Milky Way, supports the view that
the halo of the Galaxy has been built up at least partially by the
accretion of similar dwarf systems.  The Sagittarius dwarf contains
several distinct populations of stars, and includes M54 as its
nucleus, which is the second-most-massive globular cluster associated
with the Milky Way. The most massive globular cluster is $\omega$
Centauri, and here we report that $\omega$ Centauri also has several
distinct stellar populations, as traced by red-giant-branch stars. The
most metal-rich red-giant-branch stars are about 2 Gyr younger than
the dominant metal-poor component, indicating that $\omega$ Centauri
was enriched over this timescale. The presence of more than one epoch
of star formation in a globular cluster is quite surprising, and
suggests that $\omega$ Centauri was once part of a more massive system
that merged with the Milky Way, as the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy is in
the process of doing now. Mergers probably were much more frequent in
the early history of the Galaxy and $\omega$ Centauri appears to be a
relic of this area.

Prompted by the recent finding of a large number of gas-rich dwarf
irregular galaxies in the nearby southern galaxy groups Sculptor (Scl)
and Centaurus\,A (Cen\,A) we carried out a complementary survey to
search for members of the gas-poor dwarf elliptical (dE) galaxy
family.  In total 18 dE candidates were identified on SRC Sky Survey
films covering the group regions. For five dE's in the Scl group and
and five in the Cen\,A group, membership information is available from
surface brightness fluctuations distance measurements, two dE's in
each group also have independent redshift measurements. The remaining
eight galaxies have been associated to the groups based on their
morphology. We acquired deep $B$ and $R$-band CCD images for all
galaxies and determined their photometric and structural
parameters. According to the magnitude range covered, $-14 < M_{\rm B}
< -9$ (not counting the bright dS0 NGC\,59), these objects are local
dwarf spheroidal (dSph) analogues. The surface brightness profiles of
most dwarfs are strongly non-exponential but are perfectly explained
by the 3-parametric S\'ersic law. The best-fitting S\'ersic parameters
are compared with corresponding data for Virgo dE's and dSph's. The
present dE's follow the relations between the S\'ersic parameters and
absolute $B$-band magnitude for Virgo dE's and local dwarfs, thus
confirming the membership to the Scl and Cen\,A groups, respectively.
Most of our dwarfs exhibit colour gradients in ($B - R)_0$, in the
sense of a reddening outwards. We also show and discuss the sky
distributions and $B$-band luminosity functions of the Scl and Cen\,A
groups. The completeness magnitude for both populations (from the
present survey) is estimated to be $M_{\rm B}^{\rm lim} \approx -13$.
We find that the composite luminosity function of four nearby galaxy
groups is well fitted by a Schechter function down to $M_{\rm B}^{\rm
lim} = -14$ with a faint end slope $\alpha = -1.29(\pm0.10)$.  In the
appendices we present best-fitting S\'ersic profile parameters for the
dSph members of the Local Group and introduce two new dwarf irregulars
found in the Cen\,A group.

We have obtained deep $B$ and $R$-band CCD photometry for five dwarf
elliptical galaxies that were previously identified on Schmidt films
covering the region of the Centaurus A (Cen\,A) group. {From} a Fourier
analysis of the $R$-band CCD images we determined the surface
brightness fluctuation (SBF) magnitude $\bar{m}_R$ for each stellar
system.  All magnitudes are similar and, given the small colour
spread, suggest that these low surface brightness galaxies lie
approximately at the same distance, regardless of the assumed SBF zero
point. Long-slit spectra have been acquired to derive redshifts for
two of the dwarfs, ESO269-066 and ESO384-016. The velocities,
$v_\odot=784$\,\kms and $v_\odot=561$\,km\thinspace s$^{-1}$,
respectively, identify them unambiguously as Cen\,A group members. An
age (H$\delta_{\mbox{A}}$) -- metallicity (C$_2 \lambda$4668) analysis
of the spectra reveals an underlying old and metal-poor stellar
population in both cases. Combining photometric and spectroscopic
results we find strong evidence that indeed all dwarf galaxies are
Cen\,A group members.

Based on Cepheid, TRGB, and PNLF distances published for the two main
Cen\,A group galaxies NGC5128 and NGC5253, we adopted a mean group
distance of 3.96\,Mpc to calibrate the apparent fluctuation
magnitudes. The resulting {\em absolute}\/ SBF magnitudes $\bar{M}_R$
of the dEs correlate with the dereddened colours $(B-R)_0$ as
predicted by Worthey's stellar synthesis models using the theoretical
isochrones of Bertelli and collaborators. This good agreement allows a
calibration of the SBF method for dwarf ellipticals in the colour
range $0.8<(B-R)_0<1.5$. However, two branches of stellar populations
appear in the $\bar{M}_R$-colour plane, and care has to be taken to
decide which branch applies to a given observed dwarf. For dwarfs with
$(B-R)_0<1$ there is very little colour dependence ($\bar{M}_R \approx
-1.2$), in accord with our previous SBF analysis of faint, blue
Sculptor group dEs. For red dwarfs, $(B-R)_0>1.2$, the
$\bar{M}_R$-colour relation is steep, and accurate colours are needed
to achieve SBF distances with an uncertainty of only 10\%. One of the
dwarfs, ESO219-010, is located slightly behind the core of the Cen\,A
group at $\sim$4.8\,Mpc, while the remaining four recover the mean
group distance of 3.96 Mpc that was put into the calibration.  The
depth of the group is only 0.5\,Mpc which identifies the Cen\,A group
as a spatially well isolated galaxy aggregate, in contrast to the
nearby Sculptor group.

The $UV$ (2000 \AA) luminosity function (hereafter $UV$ LF) of Coma
cluster galaxies, based on more than 120 members, is computed as the
statistical difference between counts in the Coma direction and in the
field. Our $UV$ LF is an up-date of a preliminary constrain on the
$UV$ LF previously computed without the essential background
counts. The $UV$ LF is well described by a power law with slope
$\alpha\sim0.46$, or equivalently, by a Schechter function with $M^*$
much brighter than the brightest cluster galaxy and with a slope
$\alpha_S\sim-2.0$ or larger.  In spite of what happens in the optical
band, low luminosity galaxies give a large contribution to the
integral luminosity, and by inference, to the total metal production
rate. Galaxies blue in $UV-b$ and/or $b-r$ dominate the Coma cluster
$UV$ LF, both in number and luminosity. The major source of error in
the estimate of the $UV$ LF comes from the background determination in
the Coma direction, which is still uncertain, even though constrained
at high and low amplitudes by redshift surveys covering the studied
field.

It has been suggested that a continuous low star formation rate has
been the dominant regime in IZw 18 and in dwarf galaxies for the
lifetime of these objects (Legrand et al. 1999). Here, we discuss and
model various star-forming histories for IZw 18. Particularly, we show
that if the metallicity observed in IZw 18 results from starburst
events only, the observed colors constrain the fraction of the metals
ejected from the galaxy to be less than 50-70 \%. We demonstrate that
the continuous star formation scenario reproduces the observed
parameters of IZw 18. A continuous star formation rate (SFR) of about
$10^{-4}$ Msol/yr during 14 Gyr reproduces precisely the observed
abundances. This SFR is comparable with the lowest SFR observed in low
surface brightness galaxies (van Zee et al. 1997). Generalized to all
galaxies, the low continuous SFR scenario accounts for various facts:
the presence of star formation in quiescent dwarfs and LSBG, the
metallicity increase with time in the most underabundant DLA systems,
and the metal content extrapolations to the outskirts of spiral
galaxies. Also the apparent absence of galaxies with a metallicity
lower than IZw 18, the apparent absence of HI clouds without optical
counterparts, and the homogeneity of abundances in dwarfs galaxies are
natural outcomes of the scenario. This implies that, even if
starbursts are strong and important events in the life of galaxies,
their more subdued but continuous star formation regime cannot be
ignored when accounting for their chemical evolution.

The possibility that the Galactic spheroid was assembled from
numerous, chemically-distinct proto-Galactic fragments is investigated
using a Monte-Carlo technique designed to simulate the chemical
evolution of the Galaxy in hierarchical formation scenarios which
involve no gas dissipation.  By comparing the observed and simulated
metallicity distributions of Galactic globular clusters and halo field
stars, we estimate the level of fragmentation in the collapsing
proto-Galaxy.  Although the formation process is highly stochastic,
the simulations frequently show good agreement with the observed
metallicity distributions, provided the luminosity function of
proto-Galactic fragments had the form $dN \propto L^{{\alpha}}dL$
where $\alpha \sim -2$. While this steep slope is strongly at odds
with the presently observed luminosity function of the Local Group, it
is in close agreement with the predictions of semi-analytic and
numerical models of hierarchical galaxy formation.  We discuss a
number of possible explanations for this discrepancy.  These
simulations suggest that the Galactic halo and its globular cluster
system were assembled via the accretion and disruption of $\sim$
$10^3$ metal-poor, proto-Galactic fragments by the dominant building
block: a proto-bulge whose own metal-rich globular clusters system has
been preferentially eroded by dynamical processes. This formation
scenario may provide a simple explanation for the different shapes of
the Galactic globular cluster and halo star metallicity distributions.
Based on the similar properties of globular clusters belonging to
spiral and giant elliptical galaxies, we argue that the same process
($e.g.$, hierarchical growth involving little gas dissipation) is
responsible for the formation of both giant elliptical galaxies and
the bulge-halo components of spiral galaxies.  \par

On the basis of the propagating star-formation model, we investigated
the star-formation activities of dwarf irregular galaxies (dIrrs) by
considering two processes: the heating from stellar feedback and the
cooling of the heated gas. After examining the timescales of the two
processes, we propose that continuous global star-formation activity
is difficult in dIrrs, since their small sizes make the feedback
efficient and their small metallicities prevent the cooling from
becoming effective. Thus, the intermittent nature of the
star-formation activities of dIrrs, which is due to the small
metallicity as well as the small size, is predicted.  We emphasize
that the size of a galaxy is an important factor concerning
star-formation activity.  The intermittence of the star-formation
activity is also supported by the observed scatter of the {\it UBV}
colors and H$\alpha$ equivalent widths of the dIrr sample. However, we
note that efficient interstellar mixing may make the cooling time much
shorter.

\medskip

Far-ultraviolet (FUV), H$\alpha$, and HI observations of dwarf galaxy
Holmberg~II are used to investigate the means by which star formation
propagates in galaxies lacking global internal triggering mechanisms
such as spiral density waves.  The observations trace the interaction
between sites of massive star formation and the neutral and ionized
components of the surrounding ISM in this intrinsically simple system.
Both local and large-scale triggering mechanisms related to massive
star formation are seen, suggesting that feedback from massive stars
is a microscopic process operating in all galaxies to a certain
degree.

The data emphasize the importance of local conditions in regulating
star formation from evidence such as massive stars inside ionized
shells, compact HII regions surrounding aging clusters, and stars
formed in chains of progressing age. Surface brightness profiles show
current activity correlates with the time averaged level of past star
formation at a given radius demonstrating a reliance on local
conditions.  Large-scale triggering by HI shells is supported by
observations of progenitor populations as well as secondary sites of
star formation associated with their dense rims. Analysis of the
energy available from massive stars inside HI shells indicates energy
deposited into the ISM from supernovae and stellar winds is sufficient
to account for the HI morphology. Ages of individual star forming
regions are derived using B, H$\alpha$, and FUV photometry and show
both older, diffuse FUV regions and younger, compact HII regions.  The
distribution of ages is reconciled with the HI morphology, showing a
clear preference of young regions for areas of dense HI and old
regions for HI voids.  Global kinematical properties may also play a
role in the star formation process since differences in the rotation
characteristics of the neutral gas disk correlate with differences in
triggering mechanisms. Large-scale feedback from massive stars is
shown to operate in regions that lack differential shear in the gas
disk.

We present submillimeter observations of the Local Group, metal-poor,
irregular dwarf galaxy IC~10, directly relevant to the interaction
between interstellar medium and star formation activity in primeval
galaxies. Using the JCMT, we have observed the fine structure neutral
carbon transition $^3$P$_1\rightarrow^3$P$_0$ at 492 GHz and the
rotational $J=3\rightarrow2$ transition of $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO in
the most massive giant molecular cloud complex in this galaxy,
IC~10-SE.  We find that, although the $\rm I_{[CII]}/I_{CO}$ ratio for
this object is a factor of 4 larger than the typical Milky Way value,
its [C~I] to CO intensity ratio $\rm I_{[CI]}/I_{CO}\simeq18\pm2$ (in
units of erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ sr$^{-1}$) is similar (only about 50\%
larger) to that of the Milky Way.  Modelling of the behaviour of the
[C~II]/CO and [C~I]/CO intensity ratios with metallicity indicates
that, if C$^+$ and C$^0$ are chiefly produced by UV photodissociation
in the PDR, both ratios should increase sharply with decreasing
metallicity (and consequently diminished UV shielding; Bolatto,
Jackson, \& Ingalls 1999\markcite{BJI99}). These data then suggest a
different origin for an important fraction of C$^0$ in these clouds,
unrelated to photodissociation.

We have also mapped the 850 $\mu$m continuum in this region using
SCUBA. Employing these data in conjunction with KAO and IRAM
measurements we find that the 100 $\mu$m to 1300 $\mu$m continuum
emission corresponds to a graybody with an extremely low emissivity
exponent, $\beta\sim0.5$.  We conclude that this low exponent is most
likely due to the destruction of small dust grains, brought about by
the increased penetration of UV radiation in the low metallicity
ISM. If a low emissivity exponent in the submillimeter is a general
property of metal-poor systems then the interpretation of millimeter
and submillimeter surveys of high-z galaxies should be revised.

It is now generally believed that galaxies were built up through
gravitational amplification of primordial fluctuations and the subsequent
merging of smaller precursor structures. The stars of the structures that
assembled to form the Milky Way should now make up much or all of its bulge and
halo, in which case one hopes to find "fossil" evidence for those precursor
structures in the present distribution of halo stars. Confirmation that this
process is continuing came with the discovery of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy,
which is being disrupted by the Milky Way, but direct evidence that this
process provided the bulk of the Milky Way's population of old stars has so far
been lacking. Here we show that about ten per cent of the metal--poor stars in
the halo of the Milky Way, outside the radius of the Sun's orbit, come from a
single coherent structure that was disrupted during or soon after the Galaxy's
formation. This object had a highly inclined orbit about the Milky Way at a
maximum distance of $\sim$ 16 kpc, and it probably resembled the Fornax and
Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxies.

Most of the globular clusters in the main body of the Galactic halo
were formed almost simultaneously. However, globular cluster formation
in dwarf spheroidal galaxies appears to have extended over a
significant fraction of a Hubble time. This suggests that the factors
which suppressed late-time formation of globulars in the main body of
the Galactic halo were not operative in dwarf spheroidal
galaxies. Possibly the presence of significant numbers of ``young''
globulars at $\rm R_{\rm GC} > 15$ kpc can be accounted for by the
assumption that many of these objects were formed in Sagittarius-like
(but not Fornax-like) dwarf spheroidal galaxies, that were
subsequently destroyed by Galactic tidal forces. It would be of
interest to search for low-luminosity remnants of parental dwarf
spheroidals around the ``young'' globulars Eridanus, Palomar 1, 3, 14,
and Terzan 7. Furthermore multi-color photometry could be used to
search for the remnants of the super-associations, within which outer
halo globular clusters originally formed. Such envelopes are expected
to have been tidally stripped from globulars in the inner halo.

We have ground-based and HST WFPC2 imaging of the nearby low surface
brightness dwarf spheroidal galaxy DDO~44.  For the first time DDO~44
was resolved into stars. The resulting color-magnitude diagram for
about 1290 stars show the red giant branch with a tip at $I =
23.55\pm0.15$, which yields the distance $D_{MW}= 3.2\pm0.2$ Mpc
consistent with membership of DDO~44 in the NGC~2403 group. The linear
separation of DDO~44 from NGC~2403 is 75 kpc on the sky and
$30\pm450$~kpc along the line of sight. The relationship between the
dwarf galaxy's absolute magnitude, $M_R^o = -13.1$, the central
surface brightness, $\mu_R(0) = 24.1$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$, and the mean
metallicity, [Fe/H] = $-$1.7 dex follow the trend for other nearby
dwarf spheroidal galaxies.  One globular cluster candidate has also
been identified in DDO~44.  \par

We review single-star photometry with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST)
of five well resolved Blue Compact Dwarf (BCD) galaxies. Three BCDs
exhibit well populated red giant branches. These galaxies are
therefore at least 1-2~Gyr old, and possibly older than 10~Gyr. For
two BCDs, the available HST data do not go deep enough to reveal the
red giant branch. We argue that over a wide range of possible galaxy
distances, the color-magnitude diagrams of these BCDs are nevertheless
consistent with showing the evolved descendants of intermediate-mass
stars on the asymptotic giant branch. Such stars are nucleosynthetic
sites of nitrogen and carbon production. Their identification in BCDs
contradicts recent conclusions that BCDs must be young galaxies in
which primary production of these elements takes place exclusively in
massive stars, and implies that BCDs are unlikely to be home to newly
formed metal-free stars. Color-magnitude diagrams of BCDs thus point
to difficulties in decoding star-formation histories of starburst
galaxies from the metallicities of the ionized gas.

We focus on two aspects of $\omega$ Cen that are rather
uncharacteristic of globular clusters: its metallicity distribution
and its orbit.  We use (1) a Washington $(M-T_2,M)_o$ color-magnitude
diagram containing 130,000 stars, (2) DDO51 photometry to separate out
giants from field dwarfs, and (3) a mapping of $(M-T_2,M-DDO51)_o$
colors to [Fe/H] to derive a metallicity distribution function (MDF)
for $\omega$ Cen.  The MDF is corrected for field giant contamination
by a radial velocity membership study of a subsample of stars spanning
all abundances.  As with previous studies, the MDF is very wide with a
peak near [Fe/H]=-1.7 and extending to both higher and lower
abundance, but with few stars having [Fe/H]$>~-1.2$.  The orbit of
$\omega$ Cen is strongly retrograde, has small apogalacticon and is
almost coplanar with the Milky Way disk -- i.e., an orbit unlike any
known for almost all Galactic globular clusters, and unique among
clusters with its horizontal branch type and [Fe/H].  This derived
orbit is perpendicular to the $\omega$ Cen's major axis, but the
latter is a result of rotation and not tidal stretching or stripping.
Nevertheless, we propose that the MDF and orbit of $\omega$ Cen, when
considered in light of other unusual $\omega$ Cen properties -- such
as its mass, purported age spread (we note a wider than expected main
sequence turn-off), and differences in kinematics and spatial
distributions -- are consistent with a picture wherein this object is
the remains (nucleus) of a once larger satellite dwarf galaxy that has
been substantially reduced by tidal stripping.  N-body models by
Walker et al.\ (1996), show that (1) inclined orbits of satellites
first sink towards the Galactic plane before substantial radial decay
of the orbit, and significant disruption, ensue, (2) retrograde
satellites face considerable shredding as they pass through the disk,
and (3) the remains of stripped satellites form compact, globular
cluster bodies.  A model wherein $\omega$ Cen faced considerable
stripping by the Galactic disk can account for the cluster's current
state; for example, the {\it present} mass of $\omega$ Cen is unlikely
to have generated strong enough dynamical friction to modify its orbit
to its presently small apocentric radius.  A present-day counterpart
of this process may be the Sagittarius dSph system, for which the
globular cluster M54, which has a mass similar to $\omega$ Cen, has
been purported to be the nucleus.  A larger proto-$\omega$ Cen on a
retrograde orbit plowing through the Milky Way disk may have aided
thick disk formation both through the contribution of tidally stripped
stars and through substantial thin disk heating.

Dwarf ellipticals have the lowest stellar densities of any galaxies, but
paradoxically are most common in the densest regions of the universe, and are
especially frequent in rich clusters of galaxies. Simple estimates suggest that
low luminosity dwarf ellipticals should be subject to substantial tidal heating
in rich clusters if most of their mass is in the form of normal stars. We have
therefore undertaken a program to image dwarfs in clusters with the 3.5-m high
performance WIYN, ARC and smaller, wide field telescopes. Our objectives
include testing for evidence of tidal disruption in the form of asymmetries and
searching for evidence of recent star formation which might be associated with
the production of elliptical dwarfs from in-falling field galaxies.

Several emerging links between high-redshift observational cosmology and the
Galactic fossil evidence found in the kinematics, metallicities and ages of
Milky Way stars are discussed. In a flat Cold Dark Matter model with
$\Omega\simeq 0.3$ that agrees with present large-scale structure observations,
the oldest stars in the Milky Way should have formed in the first halos where
gas was able to cool, at $z\simeq 20$. These earliest, weakly bound dwarf
galaxies probably turned only a small fraction of their gas to stars, which
should be metal-poor. However, the merging rate in the early universe was much
faster than the present one, so massive halos with more efficient star
formation and metallicities up to the highest values present today in the bulge
could have formed less than $10^9$ years after the oldest stars. The mean
metallicity produced in the universe by a given redshift is related to the mean
surface brightness of star-forming galaxies above this redshift, and also to
the re-ionization epoch if galaxies were the dominant sources of ionizing
radiation. The biased distribution of the early dwarf galaxies where the first
stars formed should result in an age gradient with radius of the
low-metallicity stars in the Milky Way, with the oldest ones concentrated in
the bulge and the youngest in the outer halo and the Local Group dwarf
galaxies.

The effects of mergers in low mass galaxies are poorly understood. In
this paper we analyze different observational evidences which support
the view that mergers can trigger starbursts in dwarf galaxies. We
discuss the relationships between blue compact galaxies (BCGs), dIs,
dEs and low surface brightness galaxies (LSBGs) and present some
evidences which favour that strong starbursts are caused by mergers
between dEs and LSBGs.

In about 40\% of the Local Group galaxies star clusters have been
detected so far, but the census is still incomplete. The properties of
these clusters are briefly reviewed, and the impact of galaxy
environment on the evolution and survival of star clusters is
discussed. Several (but not all) Local Group galaxies seem to share a
common epoch of the earliest globular cluster formation. The most
massive galaxies show a tendency for rapid enrichment in their oldest
cluster population near their centers as compared to clusters at
larger galactocentric radii. The galactocentric dependence of cluster
sizes and horizontal branch morphology may be intrinsic to the
globular cluster formation process rather than to the accretion of
dwarf galaxies. The observed properties of globular clusters in the
least massive dwarfs suggest that their parent galaxies may originally
have been substantially more massive. Cluster destruction mechanisms
and time scales are a function of galaxy environment and galaxy
mass. The most recent enhancement of star cluster formation in the
Magellanic Clouds may have been triggered by their close encounter
with each other and the Milky Way.  \par

A class of compact, isolated high--velocity clouds which plausibly
represents a homogeneous subsample of the HVC phenomenon in a single
physical state was objectively identified by Braun \& Burton (1999).
Six examples of the CHVCs, unresolved in single--dish data, have been
imaged with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope. The
high--resolution imaging reveals the morphology of these objects,
including a core/halo distribution of fluxes, signatures of rotation
indicating dark matter, and narrow linewidths constraining the kinetic
temperature of several opaque cores.  In these regards, as well as in
their kinematic and spatial deployment on the sky, the CHVC objects
are evidently a dynamically cold ensemble of dark--matter--dominated
HI clouds accreting onto the Local Group in a continuing process of
galactic evolution.  \par

Six examples of the compact, isolated high--velocity clouds catalogued
by Braun \& Burton (1999) and identified with a dynamically cold
ensemble of primitive objects falling towards the barycenter of the
Local Group have been imaged with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio
Telescope; an additional ten have been imaged with the Arecibo
telescope.  The imaging reveals a characteristic core/halo morphology:
one or several cores of cool, relatively high--column--density
material, are embedded in an extended halo of warmer, lower--density
material. Several of the cores show kinematic gradients consistent
with rotation; these CHVCs are evidently rotationally supported and
dark--matter dominated.  The imaging data allows several independent
estimates of the distances to these objects, which lie in the range
0.3 to 1.0 Mpc.  The CHVC properties resemble what might be expected
from very dark dwarf irregular galaxies.

Low Surface Brightness Galaxies (LSBGs) today constitute the less
known fraction of galaxies: their number density and their physical
properties (e.g.  luminosity, colour, dynamics) are still largely
uncertain. This is mainly due to the difficulty in finding them
(since their presence goes often unnoticed when astronomical images
are analyzed with standard methods) and in measuring their
properties. We present here the first results of a novel application
to DPOSS plates, a project within the CRoNaRio collaboration. The aim
is to build a large catalog of LSBGs, with much better understanding
of completeness and biases. First results are quite encouraging: in the
same regions covered by existing catalogues, done on the same plates,
we find several new LSBGs in addition to the known ones.

Low-mass stars, those with main-sequence lifetimes that are of order
the age of the Universe, provide unique constraints on the Initial
Mass Function (IMF) when they formed. Star counts in systems with
simple star-formation histories are particularly straightforward to
interpret, and those in old systems allow one to determine the
low-mass stellar IMF at large look-back times and thus at high
redshift. We present the faint stellar luminosity function (based on
optical HST data) in an external galaxy, the Ursa Minor dwarf
Spheroidal (dSph). This relatively-nearby (distance 70\,kpc) companion
galaxy to the Milky Way has a stellar population with narrow
distributions of age and of metallicity, remarkably similar to that of
a classical halo globular cluster such as M92 or M15, i.e. old and
metal-poor. Contrasting with globular clusters, the internal velocity
dispersion of the Ursa Minor dSph indicates the presence of
significant amounts of dark matter. We find that the main sequence
stellar luminosity function of the Ursa Minor dSph, and implied IMF,
down to 0.4 of a solar mass is indistinguishable from that of the halo
globular clusters M92 and M15. Thus the low mass stellar IMF for stars
that formed at high redshift is invariant in going from a
low-surface-brightness, dark-matter-dominated external galaxy, to a
globular cluster within the Milky Way.
