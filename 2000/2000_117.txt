Dear Cospa colleagues,

A paper to reveal the results of the first estimations of cosmological 
paprameters from the celebrated BOOMERANG (closely related to our AMIBA) 
has been posted in the astro-ph archive 
with the manuscript number astro-ph/0005004.

It seems like that the results do agree with the standard basic inflation
paradigm quite satisfactorily although the baryon number density is higher 
than the estimates from the big bang nucleosynthesis ... 

The abstract of the paper is following:

The anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation contains
information about the contents and history of the universe. 
We report new limits on cosmological parameters derived
from the angular power spectrum measured in the Antarctic
flight of the BOOMERANG experiment within the framework of
inflation-motivated adiabatic cold dark matter models. Using a
weak prior on the Hubble expansion parameter $h$ we find that the
curvature is close to flat and the primoridal fluctuation
spectrum is nearly scale invariant, in agreement with the basic
inflation paradigm. We find that the data prefer a baryon density
$\Omega_b h^2$ above, though similar to, the estimates from light
element abundances and big bang nucleosynthesis. When
combined with large scale structure observations, the BOOMERANG
data provide evidence for both dark matter and dark
energy contributions to the total energy density $\Omega_{tot}$. 

cheers,
