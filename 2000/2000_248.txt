            ==================================================
            
            Colloquium (2:00 pm)
            Taped at University of California, Berkeley, on 3 October 1999

            SPEAKER: Dr. Michael Fall
                     (STScI)
	    TITLE:   "Cosmic History since z=5" 
                      
            ABSTRACT: Would you like to know how the Universe was and has 
                      evolved since z=5, at or close to the epoch when many
                      'recognizable' galaxies may have first formed?  A short 
                      preview by Jeremy Lim suggests that this largely 
                      OBSERVATIONAL deduction may be made by the speaker using 
                      Lyman-alpha absorption systems; the speaker is one of the 
                      world's foremost experts on this subject.  Since Jeremy 
                      Lim has read a little about Lyman-alpha absorption 
                      systems, he and possibly others in the audience may be 
                      able to answer some of the questions that you may have 
                      during the talk.
                      
            Note: For your enjoyment we will project the video onto the big 
                  screen, although unfortunately we will not have 
                  theater-quality (although acceptable) sound.          
                      
  
  
                      
            Journal Club (3:30 pm)

            SPEAKER: Dr. Jiang Ing-Guey
                     (ASIAA)
	    TITLE:   "The Accelerations of Stars Orbiting 
                      the Milky Way's Central Black Hole"
                      (Ghez et al. astro-ph/0009339 or Nature Sep. 21)
